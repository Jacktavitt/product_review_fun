I don't know if the description was changed from when I ordered, but the current description says only right hands. It would be nice to have an equal number of left and right hands. I like having the thumbs match my thumbs. We take these everywhere and either get excitement and smiles out of people or get awkward and creeped out looks. I love the details with the veins and fingerprints though. They are a little tight on my fingers, but I think most people won't have this issue."

Considering these ARE rubber hands, they do get dirty quite easily and will require cleaning with soap. Color does not rub off! Still a funny gag toy! (The hands are really detailed by the way) In conclusion: BUY AT YOUR RISK: - because they might come in uneven numbers of right and left hands - the wrong hand color PROS: Hey, in the end, you still got 10 mini hands, so smile!"

Frankly, I don't see the value in investing the time or or additional money into finding out. I can just help you.

I have had no problem with skipping, but if you do, there are easy fixes for it. Toss a weight onto the arm and youll be good. I had ordered it in turquoise and it is LOVELY. The sound quality isnt bad either. Not extremely loud, but loud enough. If you're looking for something incredible, youll probably be spending upwards of 300 dollars on one thatll have no flaws, but for the price of this, it makes a unforgettable gift or experience."

I recommend using external speakers if possible since the on-board speakers are small, and you are listening to vinyl. The reason I am giving 4 stars is that this unit is very light and the switches could have a stronger more friendly design. The briefcase top also comes very close to the bottom of the playing album. While it did not rub on the albums I have played, an older warped album may strike the lid when spinning so use caution if you are playing a lot of vintage records."

Do not buy this if you are looking to truly experience vinyl or analog format music. Buy a real turntable with an amplifier and speakers. Do it the right way and not because you want to tell people you have vinyl records. Don't expect the world with this unit."

For not having any external speakers connected, the sound quality is great. I have it connected in my living room and can hear it from my bedroom while I'm getting ready. You can hook up external speakers if you'd like to, so that's also a cool option. All in all, I give this a 5 star rating.

For its size, it's handles bass very well with very little distortion, even at high volumes, all while having the clarity music deserve. And believe me, this thing get loud! It's extremely light, 10 hr battery, USB charged, waterproof, can also be daisy-chained, and all under 50 bucks. Again, for ITS SIZE AND PRICE, it's the best little speaker out there hands down."

                "review_text": "Great speaker for the price. I wish there was a little more bass, but it probably wouldn't be possible based on the size and price. At least the bass that is present isn't distorted. The bass and highs sound very good, but the mids might be a little low, but again the speaker sounds really good. The speaker is loud enough for a small room, but wouldn't fill up a large room. The speaker is definitely beautiful and the clip is nice and sturdy. The material it is made out of feels nice to the touch and seems to be high quality. One thing to note, this may be different than some Bluetooth headphones you may be used to regarding the built-in audio cord/cable. The Sony Bluetooth headphones I have are not required to be turned on or connected via Bluetooth to anything if I have an audio cable plugged in to them directly. That is not the case with this speaker though. Even if I have the speaker connected via the audio cable to an MP3 player, it must be turned on and it will automatically pair/connect with your phone. This can be annoying if you are using a separate MP3 player and a phone call comes in to your phone which was previously paired to the speaker. Not a deal breaker, but something to make note of."

I never write reviews but my experience with Ninja's customer service was so exceptional that I felt compelled to write one. I'll start by saying the Ninja is an excellent blender for $70. I blend frozen fruit with it every single day. It pulverizes everything into a smooth drink every time. About 1 week ago, for an unknown reason, my blender stopped working; when I went to turn it on the power button just started blinking instead. I wasn't sure what this meant so I emailed Ninja. The representative was kind, attentive, and replied to my emails extremely promptly (sometimes within minutes). I let him know what happened, and all he asked me for was: 1) the blender model number 2) where I purchased the blender and the approximate date of purchase 3) the warranty number (which happens to be just a 4 digit number engraved on the prongs which plug-in to your electrical outlet) As soon as I gave him that information, he emailed me with a confirmation-of-shipment of a new pitcher along with a tracking number. The new pitcher arrived in 3 business days and my blender is working like new again (I never figured out what was wrong with the old pitcher or why it was preventing my blender from turning on). I love companies that provide exceptional customer service and I will never purchase another blender other than Ninja. Thank you Ninja!"

Makes for easy cleaning if you're making something more than a smoothie where you have to take the entire lid off, you can reach in, grab the head of the blade attachment and just easily pull the blade out. It's a fantastic product and you can't blame the product for a \"design flaw\" when it's simply OPERATOR ERROR."

                "review_text": "There are some products that just change your life. I wanted to get in on the smoothie thing, and there simply is no other way to do it than with a blender, and no better blender to do it with. The blender is mostly plastic, but it doesn't feel cheap. It is very secure. It locks onto the base with a satisfying click. The lid locks down with a similar click. Unless you have heard both clicks, the blender won't start. And good thing. The blades are very sharp. They are angled to create a vortex that instantly turns any fruits and vegetables inside into viscous liquid. I like that the spout has a lid that locks open so you can pour easily. The blades come out so that they can be cleaned easily, along with the inside of the decanter. I saw that another buyer was cut when the blades \"flew out\" during cleaning. I have looked carefully and my blade assembly does not appear to be capable of flight or even mild levitation. Nonetheless I lift it out carefully, and if I am going to use the blender again I just rinse the blades; if I want the blades completely clean I use the dishwasher and not my hands. It has been a long time since I used a blender. I stopped because they sucked. Old blenders leaked out the bottom. They were hard to clean. They had a ton of different buttons for blending speed with labels that required a thesaurus next to the cookbook. And however I parsed the gradations of perturbation between \"emulsify\" and \"macerate\", they didn't actually blend. What was at the bottom of the blender became angry and confused while whatever was in the top two thirds of the decanter remained beatifically serene. This blender has high, medium, and low settings. You can pulse. It is loud, which I take to be a feature and not a drawback. Even more than my espresso machine, this blender is extremely effective at ending unwanted conversations. For particularly persistent interlocutors, use the pulse setting. Neither my kids nor I particularly like fruits and vegetables and as a result we don't get nearly enough. And yet I can put in 10 bananas, two cartons of strawberries, two of blueberries, a bag of spinach (yes, spinach!), a cup of plain Greek yogurt, one interrupted conversation ... and: ambrosia! The decanter is huge, and yet between the three of us we can and do empty it in one meal. Yay!"

Often times you get what you pay for (I know b/c I'm cheap... like... the OG of cheap) --- but this is an exception to that rule --- I have no idea why anyone would pay $50+ for another \"more recognizable\" brand --- this is packed with all the quality you could ever need.

I'm in the unique position where I've purchased quite of few of these as gifts for family members and two for myself (my family loves wine). Why two for myself? Well, as it gets older the batter stops holding a charge quite like it used to and we had one run out battery with a cork in it. I'm sure that you're sitting there thinking \"LopsidedMidget, don't be a dummy. Just recharge it and *poof* you are absolved of your issue.\" This would be true.. with nearly any other brand. However, Oster charges by sitting on the stand and a cork gets in the way of that happening. You either have to take the whole thing apart, or invest in a new opener once this happens to you. Of the five that I have purchased for myself and family only one of them is still functional - and that's because my father quit drinking a year ago. So, why do I still give it three stars? Well, it's $20 and works well until it's inevitable failure. You'll very likely get between 1-2 years out of this guy (hopefully) and you won't regret your purchase once you use it... until you need to open wine and don't have an opener.. I've since moved on and now use the Onzeri one and have realized that this Oster model feels a lot more solid. The Ozeri sounds/feels like it's wheezing out its final breath whenever we use it to open wine. It has lasted longer, but it's feels like it has the motivation of a teenager being forced to do its chores whenever we use it. The saving grace for the Ozeri is that the charge is a cable that attaches to the outside and it doesn't rely on a base to do this, so even if it does with a cork in it we can still charge the opener and eject the cork."

I emailed customer service about my issue, 3 weeks later I got a response requesting information in order to process the return. The same day I respond to the email with all the information asked, another week goes by without a response. I email customer service to make sure they received my email with all my information and not only did they let me know they did receive my email but the product was \"no longer covered under warranty\". I responded to customer service with the exact words from their handbook stating that their product has a one year warranty and have yet to get a response. So if you are thinking about purchasing this wine opener, keep scanning for something else. This is not the one for you. TLDR; Don't buy this product, it is not made well and customer service isn't interested in fulfilling their warranty."

I do have a couple of complaints, the padding on the bar where it meets the door frame should be thicker. Mine degraded without me noticing and the actual solid bar started to push against my doorframe. Now my doorframe is damaged. I recommend putting a sock between the doorframe and the bar to provide more padding for protection. My other complaint is that the flat piece that goes against the wall above the doorframe could discolor your wall. It did mine. I recommend putting something in between the wall and the flat plastic part to prevent against this. Other than that, this is a well built product that performs as advertised."

The photo demonstrates how the unit hangs, and I'm about 0.25\" shy of fitting. Sigh. Also, this product probably won't work on anything other than flat molding: the top bar is only 0.75\" and probably doesn't provide enough offset for decorative moldings, which would probably get crushed. These size limitations aren't on Amazon's web site or in the manual, which I read before unpacked the product; this is clearly a vendor miss. Other products from this vendor note a molding size restriction of 3.5\". Update: vendor contacted me and offered a completely satisfactory solution, so I'm boosting my rating.

I only drink spring water and have drank from the filter and liked it- it had no after taste or plastic taste anymore. I did have some air bubbles following the filter change but it does go away after a little while.

Each one would fit fine but I could not get any pressure at all, just a hammering sound. This official Whirlpool filter worked right away, producing better water flow than I have gotten with any of the other filter manufacturers. I didn't notice any difference in the taste of the water. The filter was troublesome after the first night and I had to adjust it a few more times before it was just right to keep the water flowing. No problems in the month since.

                "review_text": "As an amateur astronomer, I've done a lot of research about light pollution. That led me to research about how light affects sleep. Here's the summed-up version so you don't need to read all those scientific papers I have: - Blue light is great for being awake - that's why you wake up with a blue sky (read about melanopsin and melatonin on Wikipedia) - Blue light is not good for sleep; in the 470 nanometers range, that suppresses melatonin (a key hormone for sleeping well) - Humans (and other animals) evolved to sleep in the dark - or, at the darkest, full Moonlight (just 0.1-0.3 lux of light) - Longer wavelengths of light were the only source of light at night for most of human history (fire / candles) - Tablets / phones / screens / LED's and many CFL bulbs have strong blue wavelengths that are messing with our circadian rhythms and suppressing melatonin, because they have wavelengths shorter than 530nm - 540nm So what to do in our modern world? Wear these glasses before bed. Natural melatonin production would have occurred with our ancestors starting with the onset of sunset. Wavelengths of light from the setting sun would have shifted to red, and fire or candles were usually the only form of light available. Those are both relatively dim, and in longer wavelengths. Today, our \"connected\" world has a LOT of blue light. It's messing with our sleep patterns, because our bodies evolved to only see red/orange/yellow light at night, NOT blue light/shorter wavelenghts. THESE GLASSES BLOCK THOSE MELATONIN SUPPRESSING WAVELENGTHS. Put them on a couple hours before bed. For me, I start getting drowsy about 90 minutes after wearing them. The trick is DO NOT take them off without closing your eyes or being in a dark room (a room with ONLY a dim red light would work too, as your melanopsin won't trigger melatonin suppression with red light). So when changing for bed, close your eyes when removing your shirt if you have to pull it off over your head or put your night time clothing on. Then leave these on until you turn out the light for sleep. And be sure to sleep in the dark too, or wear a sleep mask. Small amounts of light can still affect your melatonin (well, anything brighter then full Moonlight - yes, even a blue LED on your computer). You can watch TV with these on, check your phone, read your tablet, work on your laptop - just note that colors will look weird. Blue looks black. Yellow looks white. Greens look weird. And the glasses aren't exactly stylish. But if you sleep better, who cares? They work. And while you're at it, make sure your home's lights (and business if you own one) aren't shining into other people's homes or apartments. Too much light at night is what makes these things necessary in the first place. We don't need all this light at night; these glasses are just a band aid to help; what we really need is smarter outdoor lighting - aimed down, at the ground, at the proper color(s) so we aren't suppressing others melatonin. According to a Harvard study, the U.S. loses $63 BILLION dollars per year due to American's insomnia. Artificial light at night messing up people's sleep is undoubtedly part of that - let's fix that so these glasses aren't as necessary. Oh, and did these glasses work for me? An emphatic YES, they did. 5 nights (so far) of excellent sleep and well-rested mornings. And I am NOT a morning person! They work - just use them the right way, and be sure you're not doing other things that might hurt sleep (too much caffeine, lack of / too much exercise right before bed, sleep apnea, etc.) So if it's not a medical condition, do the right things, wear these, and get better sleep."

These orange Uvex Skyper glasses worn every evening - in combination with the Luminette Bright Light Theraply Glasses worn every morning - have totally transformed my life! Prior to buying these two items my sleep cycle had been appallingly since uni days. Years of working on a laptop all night in a brightly lit office had ruined my body's ability to regulate its sleep. I'd be bursting with energy at midnight, and then still powering away at dawn. It was easy to stay awake for 36 hours at time, but almost impossible to sleep. Mornings were just awful, and I'd feel lacklustre all day ... until about 7pm when my energy levels would begin to rise again. Over the years I had often tried to reform my sleep, but without any success; clearly, my brain was simply not producing melatonin. A few months ago I decided to start an experiment to see if cutting out blue light at night, and then adding bright blue light in the mornings, could overcome the chronic sleep problems. The science seemed valid, so I hoped it would work on me. I bought both the Uvex Skyper orange glasses (to block blue light in the evenings) and the Luminette glasses (to simulate bright daylight in the mornings) and used both diligently every day as part of a program to reform my sleep. Here's what I experienced. 1. Within a couple of weeks of wearing the Uvex Skyper glasses I started getting sleepy at around 11pm, like normal people do!! 2. After just a few mornings of wearing the Luminette glasses I began to enjoy waking up. I couldn't wait to pop on my \"happy glasses\" as they made me feel wonderful! Now, more than 2 months later, I wake every morning around 7am feeling bright and cheerful. 3. The quality of my sleep has been completely transformed. Only three months ago I would wake every half hour and then lie awake for another two or three hours; now I sleep soundly the whole night through! Based upon my experience, here are the key conclusions I'd to share with others. * If an inability to wind down or fall asleep is your main problem, then the orange Uvex Skyper glasses (around $9) should be your first purchase - because if you can kick-start your melatonin production at night, then you will sleep better and wake happier. * However, if you struggle to wake up and you feel sluggish for hours afterwards, then the Luminette glasses could be transformational for you (as they were for me). I used to hate mornings ... and now I love them! * You still need to be sufficiently self disciplined to use the specs diligently. E.g. if I forget to wear the orange glasses for a few nights, then my old habit of staying awake all night quickly returns. I'm writing this review jointly for the Uvex Skyper Blue Light Blocking Glasses (for evenings) and the Luminette 2 SAD Bright Light Therapy Glasses (for mornings) because I used both over the same time period and it isn't really possible to tell which of them has contributed most to resolving my sleep and wake problems."

The drawer organizer that we had previously was relatively small, I decided to purchase this one due to the dimensions of the small, square spaces. I was looking for something that would hold our room key cards and envelopes well and it looks as though I have found it! I like this design for many reasons, firstly with the mesh design it will be much easier to clean out compared to more solid materials. Working in a space where several other people work, there is bound to be bits of dust and dirt getting into things, with this it'll be much easier to keep it clean. Also, with the size of the two larger compartments, there is ample space for everything that we keep in the drawer. Not only can we fit all of our writing utensils into one compartment, we can keep larger things such as our scissors in the other, which is something we couldn't do with our smaller organizer. As I mentioned previously, I was looking for an organizer that would hold our key cards and envelopes. The four smaller compartments are perfect, I like that this comes with a little insert for one of the smaller compartments because it's great for holding paper clips. Overall, this is a wonderful drawer organizer, it's a tid bit larger than I was expecting, but it is absolutely perfect for what I was needing it for."

I am not the neatest person and whenever I looked for anything in my desk drawer, I'd have to shuffle through the mess to find it. That's changed now and at least one area of my life is organized! IMPORTANT: It seems several reviewers complained it didn't fit in their drawer. The first thing to do is MEASURE before placing the order! Seems obvious! Mine fits perfectly! As you can see from my photo, I have a place for everything with four small compartments in front and two large ones in back. I keep my keys in there now so they don't get lost! Also postage stamps and return address labels, business cards, paper clips, checkbooks, spare batteries, lip balms, nail files, calculator, pens, you name it!"

Comprehensive review ahead, skip to the end if you just want my overall opinion ~ Packaging - It was delivered with another item, and it was loose with the drawer attached with plastic along with a tag. It was padded with big plastic bubbles, and there was no damage from shipment. As a cool bonus I got this the day after I ordered it even though I had 2-day shipping. Quality - The metal mesh is sturdy and feels like it will hold up over time and use. One note - the drawer is very loose and will fall out if you pick up the organizer and tilt it forward at all, so be careful if you're moving it full of supplies. Usefulness - The compartments are big enough to fit several pencils and pens on the sides, and on the top they are shallow and suitable for things like erasers and replacement staples. The drawer is roomy and will fit lots of sticky notes, but will not fit standard 3x5 index cards. Overall, this should fit the average student's needs. My opinion- I wish the drawer was big enough to fit index cards, but overall this seems like a sturdy and useful product, well worth the money."

Some people have claimed that using DYMO label makers vs. Brother label makers will save money as the DYMO does waste less label when printing, this is both true and false --- I will explain more further down in this review. I would like to add to this review a comment about batteries, there has been multiple comments about this label maker \"eating batteries\"; I have used up trial cartridge and many labels into my second cartridge and have not changed the batteries in this unit. I am using Eneloop Rechargeable batteries and they have performed flawlessly. Keep in mind that this would be a higher drain type of device when printing and cheap \"Super Duty\" (Non-alkaline or cheap Rechargeable) batteries are probably not going to work well. As always, I recommend the investment in Eneloop batteries with a good charger (LaCrosse BC-700) PROs: - Handheld form factor - Easy to use - Prints nice looking labels - QWERTY Keyboard CONs: - NO access to any special charactors except via menus (i.e. if you need a \"-\" or a \".\" on your label, there is NO button for this and you have to go into the symbol menu to find the symbol you want) ... This is annoying and is the reason that this label maker looses one star (most of my labels include \"-\" or \".\" in them) **************************************************************************************** *** The truth about actual label costs (Pictures will be attached to this review) *** **************************************************************************************** I printed out labels using a Brother P-Touch PT-2030 and the DYMO LabelManager 160 and these were the results of my findings: As of the time of this writing, the DYMO 1/2\" D-1 label roll is selling for $14 and includes 23 feet (276 inches) of label As of the time of this writing, the Brother 1/2\" P-Touch label roll is selling for $11 and includes 26.2 feet (314 inches) of label I printed two labels that had this text in 24pt BOLD \"TEST-XX-01\" The DYMO label that was printed including wasted space on both sides was 2.75\" in length which would allow 100 labels to be printed on a $14 roll *** $0.14 per label The Brother label that was printed including wasted space on both sides was 4\" in length which would allow 78 labels to be printed on the $11 roll *** $0.14 per label *** TIE *** I printed two labels that had this text in 24pt BOLD \"255.255.255.255\" The DYMO label that was printed including wasted space on both sides was 3.375\" (3 3/8\") in length which would allow 81 labels on $14 roll *** $0.17 per label The Brother label that was printed including wasted space on both sides was 4.5\" in length which would allow 69 labels on a $11 roll *** $0.16 per label *** BROTHER WINS *** The DYMO would win with smaller labels, it seems that my first label tested is about the tie breaker in size. Bottom line: If you print SMALL labels, you will get more for your money using a DYMO label printer with less waste per label If you print larger labels, you will get more for your money using a BROTHER label printer even though it waste more per label The DYMO generally prints more labels per roll than the brother, even though there is less label per cart, however the Brother label is cheaper at this time. There is also the consideration that you might be ok with the extra tape used by the dymo, and that you might hate how much extra tape is used with the brother, ... How much time might you spend trimming brother labels because they are huge? They are both great label makers ... I hope this review helps someone make an informed decision!"

It has borders you can select to put around the text! It can write horizontal and vertical! The font sizes go from 8-20 on 1/2 inch tape with selection of 2 in between! The price is 9 dollars! And it comes with tape! Don't listen to these people complaining of things like \"it's such a pain to need symbols\" blah blah blah.

The tape cutter is very smooth and comes out from the top instead of the sides like other label makers! And after all that... If you turn it over you can physically see how. Much tape you have left.

Thanks DYMO for making things easy and quick! The labeler is fun to use and comes with a rechargeable battery. It's nice to be able to keep the battery inside and recharge with a charger. No more digging out 6 \"AA\" batteries like in my old single line labeler. Thanks!"

No, you're not going to print out a letter to grandma, but you can create your label on your computer screen (which is easier than typing it directly into the labeler) and the coolest thing (at least with my MacBook Air) I can print a label out using any font that's on my computer!!

In the research I did on stainless cookware before I chose these I found that it's a common/normal thing that happens with this type cookware. Bar Keepers Friends does a fantastic job of restoring these to like new condition. I use mine every day and I've never done anything to be extra careful while doing so. I got them to cook for my family and that's what I do. These spots don't hinder the function of these at all, it's merely cosmetic. However, having said that if you want your pans to always look brand new and unused and don't want to use a \"toxic\" cleaner I suggest you do what I just did and use plain old household vinegar for the same results. If I can figure out how I will post a photo of before and after a couple minutes of vinegar. I just added a very small amount of vinegar, about 2 T probably, swished it around let it sit for a minute, applied a sponge, rinsed, dried and bam see next photo. Like new shiny. Yes it probably has a few scratches but that too is normal after 3 years of use I'd imagine."

After my usual weeks of constantly reading into reviews and Youtubing, I decided this HAD to be what I had been searching for.

The days of \"toss whatever frozen meal bag in a non stick pan and let's eat\" are over for me. The first night we used them on come chicken breast, steamed some carrots, and made a brown sugar glaze for them. The even browning of the multiclad technology was incredible. This set makes me feel like I CAN make more than just something to eat, were actually making delicious meals and it created a \"drive\" to cook better because we know we are capable now! I can now see that stainless steel really does cook food better than non stick. The one thing I really thought would kill me is the pain of cleanup every night. We use this for all of the food we cook daily and as you fellow avid reviewers may have read, Bar Keepers Friend really what you've heard! I've used this skillet daily for a few weeks now and hot water, BKF, and a little scrubbing and they clean up great and HONESTLY quite easily. We've cooked everything with coconut oil and that stuff really makes a great oil. No sticky burnt food, just lightly stuck browned bits that can make a great pan sauce! Which is a great first step to cleaning! Using what you got! I honestly love this set and it deserves every 4-5 star review its got. You'll love this set."

                "review_text": "I was looking for a set of stainless sauce pans to replace my very aged Magnalite aluminum set which has pitted badly. I wanted fully clad stainless cookware. I looked at All-Clad Stainless, Cuisinart Multiclad Pro, Calphalon Triply, and the Tramontina Triply. I wanted a rolled lip to make pouring easier so that eliminated the All-Clad and Tramontina entries. Not sure which of the remaining two I wanted, I bought one each of the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro and the Calphalon Triply Stainless to test. After using each about a half dozen times, I was pleased with the performance of both. Neither seems to have any significant performance advantage over the other. Both heated evenly, were solidly built, and were comfortable to lift and pour. Neither handle heated too much during cooking even after simmering tomato sauce for hours. The Cuisinart's handle was warmer than the Calphalon but not by much. I did find the Calphalon slightly easier to clean food that had become stuck to the surface. However, that was negated by having a third handle rivet to clean around. Essentially, performance was the same from both lines. For those that are concerned with the appearance of the cookware, the Cuisinart Multiclad line has a brushed finish. The Calphalon Triply are polished to a mirror finish. Both were fine with me as I don't much worry about how they look. I chose the Cuisinart sauce pans for a few reasons: lids, pan sizes, and price. I like the Cuisinart's metal lids more than the Calphalon's glass ones. I don't understand the benefit of glass lids. They can't take the higher heats that metal can, can break if dropped or banged, and fog up when used so you can't see what's in the pot, anyway. The sauce pans in the Cuisinart line are available in 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 quart sizes. That's perfect for my needs. The Calphalon was availabe in 1, 1.5, 2.5, and 4.5 quart sizes. I really wanted something in the 3-3.5 quart range since I use it frequently but it is not available from Calphalon. They do make a 3 quart Chef's pan but I didn't want the curved bottom. The Cuisinart Multiclad sauce pans are priced approximately 50% less than the Calphalon Triply pans. Since they performed evenly well, the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro seemed to fit my needs best."

I read the reviews before purchasing, which questioned the authenticity of this product, but chose to ignore it since the vendor was viviscal. BIG MISTAKE. While packaging may change, and the items with older packaging are commonly reduced in price; i do not believe this is the same product as what is sold from other vivscal retailers. First, after taking this product for 3.5 weeks, I saw no change in hair loss. Second, after taking this product for 3.5 weeks I developed a horribly dry/rashy scalp. It was unbearably dry, flaky, and itchy. I decided to stop taking viviscal. My scalp eventually recovered. believing this product not to be the real deal, I purchased it at Target for $35.00. The packing is almost exactly the same but as mentioned in a previous review, the lot numbers are different. Amazon viviscal is alpha numerical, and targets in just numerical. The pill packaging is different which could fall under the packaging my vary description. The biggest and most disturbing difference is in the pill itself. The pills from target which is a verified Viviscal retailer, are denser, a totally different color and have a grainier look to it. This made me wonder what did I buy from Amazon? The pills look and smell different despite the Supplement Facts being EXACTLY the same. I have no idea what I was ingesting believing it to be Viviscal, and I would strongly recommend that NO ONE buys this from Amazon. Target might be a little bit more but it is worth it for an authentic product that does not potentially give you an awful reaction!"

I'm not sure if I've noticed a difference but a good friend said my hair texture was less frizzy. My nails are super strong and long, however. I am confident that I'll see improvement in my hair with continued use. Update: The pills in first batch I ordered were wide and flat and made in Ireland (supposedly). I definitely have noticed a difference in my hair quality since I've been taking them. Just ordered my second box and the packaging looks like a knockoff, as well as the pills being smaller in diameter and thicker and made in the US (supposedly). I emailed Viviscal the lot numbers and expiration dates so hopefully they can confirm which batch is real. I will be returning these pills pending their response. There is a reason the price is significantly cheaper than the pills at the store. (First order is the box/pills on the right and the lot number on the bottom; second order is left/top. I think the second one is the fake.) Update #2: I checked the lot numbers and expiration dates with the company and they told me that both boxes were legit but they have two factories, which would account for the differences in the pills. However, the second box (made in the US) is giving me really bad, unrelenting acne. The first box from Ireland also caused breakouts but that subsided after a week or so whereas this time it won't stop. If I can consistently get the pills made in Ireland, I'll keep taking them cause they definitely do seem to be making some difference. If not, the acne is a dealbreaker."

So you need to ask yourself do you really want it on your shelf and the Breath of the Wild Functions each provides? I want to help you answer that. Main in game functions I will mention is Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. (Though keep in mind some work with Smash, Twilight Princess HD, and Hyrule Warriors.) They will be organized into groups by their main drop. *Sword Group* - Travelors sword - Royal Sword and elemental arrows. (Smash Link/TP Link) The 2 work the same. Unique set: Twilight Princess skins. Epona appears on 1st scan. She's a contender for best horse. She sprints for more strides and the gentle temperament won't throw you off. Extras:Produce,Elemental arrows, shields Smash Link is a poor quality figurine while TP Link is one of the highest. (Skyward Sword Link) Unique: Skward Sword skins Goddess Sword. Forgettable Extras: rupees,shields High quality figurine (Breath of the Wild Link Rider) Unique: special horse saddle Extras:Produce High detail figurine. (8-bit Link) Unique:Legend of Zelda skins Sword. Nothing to go out of your way to aquire. Extras: Rupees,shields For the nostaligia collector. (Smash Toon Link/LOZ 30 anniversary Toon Link) Unique: Windwaker skins Seabreeze boomerang. I personally use boomerangs as melee weapons in Breath. The jury's out on this one. Extras:Fish Figures are good quality. *Bow Group* Travelors bow-royal bow (Smash Princess Zelda) Unique: Twilight Bow. This one rocks. Best bow by range. Literal sniper. Uses light arrows not your arrow supply. Has around a hundred shots before it goes. Not the most powerful but that range is second to none. Extras:gems, flowers, herbs Good quality figurine. Dress well done (Breath of the Wild Archer Link) Unique: none. May drop Falcon Bow but that's not exclusive Extras: elemental arrors, meat, fish Very High quality figurine. *Shield Group* Travelors shield-royal shield (Too Zelda) Unique: Heros Shield. Rendered useless by Hylian Shield. Extras: herbs, flowers, gems Figurine is ok it's good for what it is depicting (Breath of the Wild Zelda) Unique: none, source for radiant shield. Rendered pointless by Hylian Shield. Extras:herbs, flowers, gems Good figurine hard to find. *2 Handed Sword Group* Travelors claymore- Royal claymore (OoT Link) Unique: OoT skins, Biggoron sword. Not worth the trouble to get. Extras: meat, elemental arrows Figurine based on OoT artwork ok not great eyes look weird. (Smash Ganondorf) Unique: Sword of the Six Sages. Not worth it to go out of your way. Extras: rupees, gems, rare monster parts (unique to this Amiibo but you can farm all monster parts in game) Great quality figurine. Only Ganon we have so far for collectors. One of the more affordable amiibos. (Majora's Mask Link) Unique: Fierce Deity skins and sword. Functions the same as the in game barbarian set. Looks cooler but like barbarian set requires lyanel farming to upgrade. Extras: produce, elemental arrows High quality figurine. This one is expensive and getting worse...High demand by Zelda collectors. *Unique* they are all different. (Breath of the Wild Guardian) Unique: Source of guardian - guardian ++ equipment weapons and shields. Source of ancient and giant ancient (rare) cores. Source of ancient arrows. Source of ancient parts. This is the best Amiibo for in game use. If you only get one this is the one to get. Extras: gems Highest quality figure. Top 5 of best Amiibo design. Looks great. Expensive and getting worse. Approaching $50... (Breath of the Wild Bokoblin) Unique:none. In game use for this guy is at zero. Boko weapons are everywhere in game as is meat. If I had him I wouldn't bother to scan him. High quality figurine. Fairly rare in stores. (Smash Sheik) Unique: sheik's mask. Essentially an additional head skin working in the stealth clothes set. Source of Sheika weapons (outclassed by midgame) and elemental arrows. Extras: mushrooms *Champions Ballad set* All 4 may drop diamonds. Each has a unique helmet that pairs with the ancient armor set and each weapon drops corresponds to their race. Figures are of the highest quality. They are still in stores but buy fast. Happy Hunting."

Very frustrating to someone who is trying to collect the set from a specific region and the ad description is falsely advertising that, and is also told even via email that the amiibo is, in fact, from the US when it most definitely is not. Very unhappy customer right now."

The way I have been using them is to have them assist me on 2v2 battles. Training was easy, in fact a little to easy. I had my amiibo fight in two very long battles and it was maxed. Personally I think it would be more rewarding if it was much tougher to max them out, but that's just me. As for the looks of it as a figure it is pretty well done. There is a lot of detail, I just hate that yellow bar and as far I can tell there is no way to remove it and paint it a better color. Overall I think these are pretty cool. I am sure down the line there will be more to do with them."

Even if I didn't have a WiiU (I do), I might pick this up just to have it as a figure. As far as the compatibility with games, I don't play Smash Bros. much, but it's nice that I can get a pretty decent weapon each day in Hyrule Warriors. So far, though, they've only been weapons for this character, which is a bummer. (This is the same as with my Zelda amiibo, so I suspect this is a normal restriction.) Would be very nice if I could collect weapons for non-amiibo-having characters this way. (I took one star off my review because of this.)"

On the packaging(and on the amigo information page on the WiiU) it tells you that an amiibo will be used for different games. I also heard that they are working on tweaking it to be used for Hyrule Warriors, but I'm not 200% certain. You cannot train the amiibo yourself(in super smash) it's pretty much like an AI that levels up to 50 that you can customize skills, clothing color and name. In order for it to level up you must use it as your teammate(this is the only useful thing about it so far). I don't care too much for all that right now, I'm using my Link as an action figure since I collect those. He is very well detailed and worth collecting."

We've tossed it in the wash several times; it has minimal fading and we have never encountered color bleed. We regularly stash race cars/tractors, crayons, small books, a sippy cup, snack, and change of clothes. Definitely a cute and worthwhile purchase! **Original Review** I only bought this because I wanted to try a different bag (thinking out of the box, er, bag here) than the gigantic Jeep Weekender bag we have now. Diaper bags are like purses, the bigger they are the more stuff you feel you need to put in it! When I first got this Skip Hop pack I immediately agreed with other reviewers that it was way too small. HOWEVER, once I tried it out and put everything in it we'd need for a simple 2-3 hr outting, I found that SURPRISINGLY, everything fit just fine! Inside, I packed an extra outfit, a changing pad, a ziplock with crunchies, a ziplock with one stage 3 jar, one baby yogurt and a spoon, links with toy attached, and a wubbanub. Front pocket easily holds two diapers (maybe up to 4), small pack of wipes and a tube of diaper rash cream. Side pocket holds only a single bottle though. So far thats the only downside if you're planning to use this bag for an infant. Which is why I say it's good for a short outting. I haven't used it yet so I may have to update this review in a bit. I love it right now though! Hope this was helpful!"

This makes it not as great for my daughter to take to preschool, but we will probably make due instead of having to purchase a second backpack.

The material is thinner and it just doesn't feel as sturdy. As a matter of fact, I wondered if I received a counterfeit and double checked that I ordered directly from Amazon (an authorized dealer). I guess Skip Hop has just lessened their quality for the new backpacks. I hope this one holds up."

First, it does not contain the similarly-styled lunchbox at all, and latching them together via the top loop is awkward. Second, the side pouches are basically useless for any normal-size water bottle, or really anything since kids tend to toss around their bags. The outer zip compartment is too big to hold little things, and too small to hold a change of clothes or anything useful. The straps are not super comfortable for a kid, and I think a sternum strap would be both fun for a kid, and more comfortable, and likely for them to keep it on for more than a few minutes. The large leaf zipper pull is a nice touch. Having two zippers, so the top can be opened, would have been nice. I think they just didn't really design or test this much or enough on 2-3 year olds. The insulated pouch for snacks -- is NOT insulated. So I think this is better than a lot of alternatives, and it's cute. And you could do well to buy it, but I do NOT love it."

Also got one for my daughter to carry with her for emergencies. My boys already had one from boy scouts as a whistle is a great survival tool when you're off hiking. Only improvement is the metal ring that attaches lanyard to whistle could be a slightly better quality, but since this was only $1.64 at the time, I'm not deducting stars"

As an adult I enjoy playing the rain forest one but would never play the cheap sounding rhythm kids drum. The difference isn't only the mallet instead of the stick, the drum head is a far superior quality. I want to buy other remo kids drums but am afraid I would just get the tinny sounding drum head.

He played a little in there and then when hr realized he couldnt get out, he starting frowning and building up a cry!~ He wasn't hurt as I was watching him closely. It was too cute not to snap a pic. See picture posted! LOVE Remo Kids!!! UPDATE: 03/03/2015 at 22 months he is still playing with it. He now hits on it with his hands while daddy plays guitar. Sometimes he hits it on the right beats..... On a side note, I had to stop him from stepping on it a couple times. I also had to muffle it a bit with a small blanket because he is bigger with stronger arms and with the mallet it could get quite loud. I just really don't want to disturb my elderly neighbors. UPDATE : 02/7/2018 This drum is still an essential part of my my childs playroom! He is 4.5years old and now, he could actually play nice beats to troll songs! Please invest couple dollars more and get the one with two mallets! Tried the other version and you could tell the difference in the sound quality! I have been gifting this along with hohner kids xylophone for all 1 year birthdays! Just an awesome product that grows with your kid!"

I will try the larger diameter Remo Kids gathering drum to see if perhaps those don't have the ringing overtones."

It was sitting on the platform when I got home. It was very hot from the hot summer weather. I put it in fridge for like 5 minutes before using it. It consumes fast, though. I need to constantly sharp it to get the wanted details. The Prismacolor scholar pencil sharpener is what I use to sharpen it. It works perfectly. Here, I added a picture of a black kitty I drew on an A4 size sketch book. It cost me a little more than half an inch of the black color pencil. I will definetly buy a delux of 150 colors later when I have more pocket money. All in all, 5 stars! Highly recommend it!"

Having recently purchased a large set for my older daughter on Amazon, I can say with 100% confidence that this brand has declined STEEPLY in quality. I compared my old set of 72 with her new set, and even being considerably older than my own child, the original Prismas are distinctly higher in quality. Her new set came with SERIOUSLY off-centered leads, wooden shafts that are either cracked or completely different colors from one half to the other, and most concerning, the cores in many of the pencils seems to be waxier and clumps/flakes no matter what we do. I even found one pencil stamped with a misspelled color name; not a deal-breaker in and of itself, but clearly another indication of the level (or lack thereof) of quality control. I believe that many of the higher reviews for this product are from before the company began cutting corners...a search online will quickly reveal that cracked wood, broken leads, off-centered cores, and other issues have been present for several years now. I'm not new to these pencils; I know every trick in the book for sharpening, warming the cores, and handling them with care. Notwithstanding, when the product arrives damaged (after I paid for overnight shipping to reduce the amount of jostling/handling they'd otherwise receive), it's disheartening at best. I contacted Prismacolor directly about this issue, and was told that if I sent them photos of some of my damaged pencils, they would send me a return mailing label with which I could send back the set. And then I could wait seven to 10 business days, as another set was sent from Mexico to Tennessee, and then ultimately back to me. While I appreciate the offer to replace them, I see no point in going through all of that in order to get the same product AGAIN, this time with additional transit concerns and no guarantee that the pencils would be any better than what I currently have. There's no disputing that Prismacolor has chosen to make some changes to their production, be it in quality control, materials, manufacturing, or all of the above. Their steep decline in pricing reflects that reality; a 72-count set used to run more than $1 per pencil, and now sells for half that price. I almost NEVER write reviews on Amazon, but felt strongly that if someone could avoid my costly mistake it would be worth it; maybe if more people did the same, the people manufacturing Prismacolors would bring back the \"Premier\" that once made them such a great product."

The ones with the check marks in front of the set were the 3 additional ones that I bought. These are great for layering and shading. I bought a 36 count of the Prismacolor Verithins for darker lines. They work well together and each one has it's own purpose. I'm not an artist just an adult that has picked up coloring before bedtime to relax. I only wish that I would have bought one of the larger count sets since I am always looking for additional colors. If you are having challenges with sharpening them there is a you tube video about it and how you should always turn the pencil, not the sharpener, in the same continuous direction. Don't be wobbly or rotate back and fourth. There were even explanations on how many you should put into an electric sharpener and then manually sharpen one because they overheat and break the leads! Even to follow up a couple of colored pencils that have been sharpened with a graphite one to lubricate the gears again! Wow, I had NO Clue why electric sharpeners seemed to sometimes work and then not.. It makes perfect sense now! (Very important to know if you have an entire set that needs to be sharpened like the Verathins... )! There were also recommendations regarding pencils that have leads that seem to be broken within, warm them up in the sun a little bit before you sharpen.. You'll have a whole new solid lead from within on e the wax melts together.. Problem Solved! I've included a picture of the Verathins 36 count set and a 48 count set of Marco Raffine for anyone curious of the differences. There are pictures of the 50 count Prang set vs the 50 count Crayola set on the 50 count Prang review of mine. I provided a picture of the colors in the 132 count set in the last picture. The entire template is colored, just some of the colors aren't showing up well in the picture. FYI"

If you're in a hurry, the summary of this review is that this camera and monitor are great and the customer service provided by the company is outstanding (see below). So stop hunting and trying to weigh all the baby camera/monitor reviews and get this camera and monitor if it provides you with all the features you want. You really aren't going to find anything better. We initially purchased this camera and monitor after spending way too much time pouring over all the options available to us, trying to find the BEST camera and monitor for our new baby. Our main concerns were getting a good camera with quality night imaging, good sound and an easily viewable monitor. We also felt we didn't want a system that sent our image feed off to some remote server where it would be stored for some period of time for whatever analytics that the company performed. The Infant Optics DXR-8 fulfilled all our wishes. Set-up: Setting up the monitor and camera was easy. We followed the directions and had no issues at all pairing the camera and monitor. The camera was actually very light and we hung it up on the wall so it could capture the entire inside of the crib. Again, it was very easy. USE: The monitor had a clear picture in day light and more importantly, at night. The monitors range was sufficient for us and we had no problems even after we moved baby out of our room and into her own as our rooms were on different floors. The monitor always worked great and we could always see the baby when we wanted. The controls on the monitor were easy to use and the buttons were large enough to use in the middle of the night with no light or light from monitor alone. We appreciated the simplicity, particularly when sleep deprived. In terms of battery life for the monitor, we had no issues once we figured out our schedule. We used it pretty much throughout the day unplugged and kept it plugged in overnight night by our bed, pretty much like our phones. Occasionally we ran out of battery but not frequently enough where we thought there was something wrong. It was all we could ask for. Customer Service: Now for the best part. Coming up on a year of use, the power button on the monitor began to stick. We started having issues turning the monitor on and off and putting it to sleep. It got to the point where the monitor turned on and off by itself sporadically which was problematic at night. We wrote an email to Infant Optics explaining the situation and hoping for a repair or replacement. We received a response on the very same day we wrote (Sunday!) explaining that a replacement monitor would be easiest. So we sent the monitor back through the mail and sent them a picture of the package and the receipt. Given this proof, they were able to send out our replacement before they received our broken monitor and we received the new monitor in the mail in 2 days! But that\u2019s not all. We accidentally sent back the battery for the monitor which we were instructed not to do (The monitor still works without a battery if plugged in). So we wrote again explaining our mistake. Infant Optics immediately got back to us again and sent out another battery for the monitor. 2 days later we had a new battery for our new monitor. Conclusion: Honestly, we could not ask for better treatment. This is the type of costumer service that actually makes you happy and reaffirms that the Infant Optics camera and monitor was the right choice for our family. You can\u2019t go wrong with this camera and monitor. It works great and it is backed up by outstanding customer service that provides peace of mind all new parents should be afforded."

                "review_text": "Side-by-side comparison of the Samsung SEW-3043W and Infant Optics DXR-8: First, I just want to say that I am an actual customer that purchased both of these knowing that I would be returning one. It is our first baby together, and we wanted to make sure we had the best possible monitor. The mommy-to-be and I wanted to test both of these units side-by-side to see how they compared to each other. Samsung initially seemed like the better choice as it had the 5\u201d screen compared to the DXR-8\u2019s screen of only 3.5\u201d The Samsung also had music playback on the camera in the baby\u2019s room (4 different lullaby song choices), and a small night light on the top of the camera (which you can turn on and off). However, when it came to actually functionality, the DXR-8 was by far the BETTER choice. The on-screen touch controls of the Samsung lagged and were difficult to use. The Samsung\u2019s touch screen is far different than the touch screen on their cell phones, their touch screen has little sensors throughout that you can see if you look at it closely. The Samsung also went out of range (as noted in many of the pictures) when compared to the DXR-8. In one picture I took both units outside. The DXR-8 went over 200\u2019 from my house (and probably could have gone much further). The Samsung went out of range before I even got out the door. The Samsung unit failed at three different areas in my house. Trust me when I tell you that I didn\u2019t make the test easy either. I had three doors shut and about four walls separating the handheld units from their cameras. I took them throughout the house, side-by-side, at the same time. Save yourself both time and $$$ and just start with the Infant Optics DXR-8. Additional pros of the DXR-8 include the on-screen temperature display of the baby\u2019s room, and a brighter display (the Samsung display was rather disappointing, I thought it would have been the far better display, but it simply was not). The only con of the DXR-8 is the smaller screen size, but it is sufficient. Both units functioned about the same when it came to night vision."

Attached is a photo of the ThermoPro along with two other hygrometers - the Planet Waves brand shown in the photo was designed for keeping in an acoustic guitar case, and the other is a more expensive Peak Meter model. As you can see in the photo the ThermoPro reads 10% while the mid priced Planet Waves device reads 27% and the more expensive Peak model reads 28.1%. Over the course of a week the measurements of the ThermoPro varied from between 10% and 20% below the other devices (which always remained within 2% of each other). Don't waste your money if an accurate reading (as opposed to a relative reading) is important to you. This devices proves that you get what you pay for."

                "review_text": "I am a physicist with a new zone in my forced-air heating system and a piano that needs to have constant room humidity, preferably around 42%. I bought three of these monitors to assess these conditions. The first thing I did was to enclose them in an transparent, air-tight container with three other humidity monitors that I have been calibrating for years. I put the container next to the room thermostat and noted the readings 8 times over the course of 30 hours. I opened the container twice to let in air with a new humidity. Here\u2019s what I observed: 1. The readings stabilized within about an hour or two after each time I opened the container. 2. The 3 new monitors agreed with each other to within about 0.5 \u00b0F and with the thermostat reading. This is more than good enough for me to use to assess the uniformity of the temperatures in the different rooms of my new heating zone. 3. Their humidity readings agreed with each other to within 1% RH. That\u2019s excellent \u2013 but possibly inaccurate. 4. Comparing the humidity readings with my careful calibrations of the other humidity meters, I concluded that the humidity readings of these new monitors are about 2% higher than the true humidity \u2013 at about 42% RH. That is excellent. Therefore, I scientifically conclude that I am happy with this purchase!"

It was promptly replaced by the company. The replacement works correctly. This hygrometer measures temperature and humidity, and it's meant for indoor use. It operates on one AAA battery, included with the device. The device has a small kickstand that sets the device upright at an easy-to-read angle and also had a magnet so that it can be attached to a metal surface such as a refrigerator. The temperature reads in tenths of a degree. Note that the hygrometer may take an hour or so to adjust itself to its surrounding conditions, and temperature and humidity readings may be slightly off initially. Also be aware that handling the device also will change the reading temporarily, due to body heat and moisture being in contact and/or proximity."

I'm using it inside of my indoor greenhouse, which has humidity as high as 95% at times, and an average temperature of 80 degrees (F). Other monitors I've tried in the past died on me after a few days from what I'm guessing is the high humidity environment, but this one is still going strong. The accuracy seems to be on point as well. Love the small size with large font too so I can see it from a distance without taking up too much space!"

We were experiencing dry skin and chapped lips, so it's possible that the humidity level was that low, but unlikely. However, after several days it finally began to creep up and now displays what we believe to be the correct value. (30-35%) The design of the unit is nice, I especially like the magnet on the back. And at $8, the price really can't be beat. The comfort level indicator is set too high and no way to change that. 40% is perfect for a home, but this unit will say it's too dry. Above 60% and you're likely to be dealing with mold issues, but this unit will still say comfort until 70%. Dry should be under 30%, Wet should be above 60%. But I just ignore that portion of the display."
