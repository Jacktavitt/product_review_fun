Samsung Galaxy J7 - No Contract Phone - White - (Boost Mobile)(Carrier locked phone ),Best phone I have owned with Boostmobile!,5.0 ,JLO,,"I love this Samsung J7, since it is bigger than the s6 and s7, and as good as my old S5 (as compared in the images). I had no issues charging it or switching it over from old phone to this new phone - via a 4 minute phone call to Boostmobile. Yes, the S6 and S7 have -much- faster processors, but I do not need that for what I do... and so far, after 1 month of use, I absolutely love this phone!. The phone feels great, responds quickly, and looks freaking awesome. Pros: -Great price -AFFORDABLE! -Bigger than most other phones available -Great quality screen Cons: -2 bottom buttons- on side of the main home button- DO NOT light up -Camera is not comparable to that of the S5, S6, and S7 -Overall quality does not feel as sturdy as the other models mentioned (Shell plastic is thinner). After one month of use, I rated this phone with 4 stars. I will be updating this review in about 6 months. REVIEW UPDATE: February 19, 2017 After eight (8) months of owning this phone, and 7 months since this original review, I am back today to continue my review as promised. I am doing 2 things for those of you who are reading this review for the first time: 1) I have added a star to make this a 5 star review! 2) I will explain why I have decided to come back to add this star to my review. Let me clarify that since reviewing this, I have purchased a second one for my wife. I will also list what items I purchased it along with: Mr Shield Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy J7 [Will Not Fit For 2016 Version] - 2-Pack Samsung EVO 64GB Micro SDXC Memory Card with Adapter up to 48/MB/s (MB-MP64DA/AM) Phonelicious SAMSUNG Galaxy J7 Case(Boost,Virgin,TMobile,Metro PCS)Slim Fit Heavy Duty Ultimate Drop Protection Rugged Cover with Screen Protector & Stylus (Navy Blue Matte) Of course, purchasing a case, the Screen protector, and a good quality memory card may also influence how this product has performed. This phone continues to work as expected, and has delivered so far. I feel my investment on this phone has paid off, and my money has been worth. Being a somewhat frugal shopper, I thought I would give this phone a try to since it's price was reasonable for what I was getting. My 1 year old (who is now 18 months) has used and abused this phone. He has thrown it on the floor dozens of times, and has scratched, as well chewed on it. What has happened to the phone so far? - It has gained a large crack, on the screen protector. The phone is still working as it did 8 months ago, and the cheap items I purchased to protected have taken quite the toll. I had originally mentioned that the phone felt ""cheap"", and the thin plastic that it is made out of, is certainly noticeable compared to the quality of the S5, and other S series for that matter. Given that this phone has performed well, continues to deliver, and has outlasted quite some abuse, I made the judgement to give this phone the extra star, since this is a great product to my standards. I plan to come back in June, and review this item again after a full year of use!",19 Jul 2016
Samsung Galaxy J7 - No Contract Phone - White - (Boost Mobile)(Carrier locked phone ),Very good phone for the money,4.0 ,Frankie,,"I bought this phone from boost Mobile website for 200 bucks. Of course its not as good as the s7, but if you don't wanna spend 700$ for a phone, then you can't go wrong with j7. Very good phone for the money. I already bought a couple spare batteries. Pros- Good price, good call quality, fast internet, good camera, good selfie camera, great display, perfect size, great for texting, Great battery life (leave it on power save mode), good speaker, 6.0 marshmallow is great, Cons- No LED notification light, incoming ring tone couple be louder.",13 May 2016
Samsung Galaxy J7 - No Contract Phone - White - (Boost Mobile)(Carrier locked phone ),GORGEOUS phone .... I'm in love with it!,5.0 ,Colleen Marie,,I love this Samsung J7. I couldn't afford the sticker price for the S6 or S7 (sticker shock!). Therefore; I opted for this which is scaled down in terms of processing/memory BUT it's much better quality than the phone I was using for my Boost Mobile account. I had no issues charging it or switching it over from old phone to this new phone - via my online account (I didn't have to talk to anybody to do this and it worked out just great). My hubby has the Samsung S6 which he saved/paid for upfront (no contract at Boost Mobile). Comparing my new J7 to his S6 - well; apples to oranges. His has 2 processors (a quad-core and an octa-core). This J7 has just the octa-core BUT for me is proving to be plenty of processing power along with the 2GB ROM. This was pretty comparable to the ZTE Warp Elite I've been using since January 2016 but I'd have to say that the Samsung is much faster - also that the screen response is so much better in this J7 model (even with the glass protection I placed on the screen). My hubby bought me this for my upcoming 60th birthday! GREAT present for me.....all mine! Thank you 'shopcelldeals' for selling this at a reasonable price that was affordable. Recommended.,06 May 2016
Samsung Galaxy J7 - No Contract Phone - White - (Boost Mobile)(Carrier locked phone ),Love the phone,5.0 ,Leesaa,,"Awesome phone for the price. Face it, these are not the S7 phones but a cheaper version. I have no problem with them at all. Plenty of memory and large screen. I love the phone. You are getting a Marshmallow system which should keep me going for a couple of years. Boost mobile is like every other cell company. Hard to deal with on the phone but once the service is set up, no problems. Fast 4gLTE.",05 Jul 2016
Samsung Galaxy J7 - No Contract Phone - White - (Boost Mobile)(Carrier locked phone ),Worth it.,5.0 ,TG,,I love this phone! Coming from the galaxy S3 for Boost this is a big jump in the right direction. $20 cheaper on amazon than the boost mobile site another plus.The battery last all day. That is while talking/texting using apps. It is two times bigger than the S3 but def worth it. The operating system is much faster and more responsive as well.,19 Nov 2016
Samsung Galaxy J7 - No Contract Phone - White - (Boost Mobile)(Carrier locked phone ),This is a great phone for Boost Mobile,5.0 ,David Erickson,,This is a great phone for Boost Mobile. I have had it a few months and it's been great. Much nicer than my old one and the big screen has spoiled me. The iPhone 6 I use for work is tiny by comparison and I much prefer this phone over the iPhone.,06 Oct 2016
Motorola Moto G (3rd Generation) No Contract Phone (Virgin Mobile) - Retail Packaging,Excellent Phone For Value-Conscious Buyers & Intermediate Users - Rugged Weatherproof Design,5.0 ,Mr. Staack,,"I've had some time to kick my phone around (figuratively and literally), and I'm really impressed with this phone. It's value priced, but still very functional. I switched from a Samsung Galaxy SIII, and I feel that this was definitely an upgrade. While the Moto G3 has less memory (8GB) and storage (both internally, and it only supports up to 32GB SDHC micro card), the better processor makes a huge difference. I don't play games, but I do still run a fair number of productivity apps (the biggest being Polaris Office and TeamViewer) and they benefit greatly from the quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 CPUs performance. The SIII would always hang up when running bigger applications, and would always freeze up when pulling up the SwiftKey keyboard. Some apps were almost unusable on the SIII because of these stutters and freezing (ProCapture was the biggest problem). I'm really impressed at how good the camera sensor is. The color, contrast, and brightness of the screen are also incredible. I've had better luck with 4G data, though I do notice a little less speed on Wifi after losing 5 gHz connectivity. The audio on the phone is an improvement, with the two larger speakers on the front of the device. Call clarity has been about as good as the SIII, in my tests. The phone construction is very solid, and seems very rugged in general. I was very happy with the upgrade, from the Galaxy SIII. For my purposes, it's a great phone. I like that it's water resistant, and it performs very well. My girlfriend ended up upgrading to the same phone, from an HTC Desire 816, and she's very happy with the performance boost. It's definitely NOT a flagship phone, and it's only suitable for lower-end or older games. This is not a power user phone, by any means. The smaller storage is probably the biggest limitation. While it hasn't greatly affected me, as I only have a few big apps, but it's definitely the most profound limitation of the phone. If you don't need the power and space of a flagship phone, but still want a very high-quality all-weather handset, I think this is an excellent option. The price jumps around, so if you wait around for a small discount, this is probably one of the better deals on the current phone market. It suits my needs very well, and - having survived being caught in a few big downpours - has been worth every penny. Sept. 2016 Update: For a few weeks, I was having problems with the SD Micro card becoming unmounted, or write problems on the SD Micro card. I assumed it was loosening up in the case (a problem I had with an older phone). Eventually it would refuse to re-mount, despite all attempts. It turned out the phone was having specific problems with the Samsung 32GB EVO Plus Class 10 Micro SDHC, that several other Moto G3 users experienced. I replaced it with a Class 6 Kingston card, and it's been working flawlessly ever since, without any noticeable decrease in read/write speeds.",01 Aug 2016
Motorola Moto G (3rd Generation) No Contract Phone (Virgin Mobile) - Retail Packaging,Very good for Virgin Mobile.,5.0 ,Veronica Hale,,"This phone is one of the best I have had from Virgin Mobile, and know it would be better with T-Mobile or another GSM carrier with the extra specs those add. The camera is very nice for such a cheap phone, 13mp in the back, 5mp in the front. Works well in relatively low lighting and doesn't begin to look grainy until it's obviously much too dark, such as outside in the night with a fire for just light like the stone ages. Anyway, it's not the best camera, but definitely better than the LG Volt and LG G Stylo I had had before this one. The screen isn't brilliantly bright and crisp, but I promise it doesn't look horribly. The screen is big, but not too big, more comfortable than the LG G Stylo in my personal opinion, but if you like ""Phablets"", this is a big small, but you'd probably get used to it. The ram is only 1gb in the Virgin Mobile edition, and only 4.5gb of internal storage available to the user, even though it advertises 8gb. The other phone with the GSM carriers have 2gb of ram, and 16gb or storage with only 10gb or so left for the users accessibility. It comes with Lollipop, although I am sure the Marshmellow update wouldn't be long to hit considering it did hit the LG G Stylo quickly, and this phone is the 2015 successor of the Moto G lineups. The phone is able to be rooted, although I do not advise for it will void your warranty with Motorola and possibly Virgin Mobile, so you should know what you are doing. However, this should be brought up because Virgin Mobile carries a variety of cheap phones, but they are mostly LG. LG should not be rooted because they end up killing over and are touchy. Motorola is more laid back, and it should be noted so people know what they should and shouldn't if they are not experienced and want to try new things. Yes, this phone is water resistant, but not water proof. You can not swim with it and epect to use it under water. This is purely for accidents only. You can use this near water and if something splashes on it, it will be fine. You must remember to seal the back near the camera and the edges, or it will completely useless and you will lose your phone to water damage. The biggest con is the bit of crashes I have experienced on such little use. The play store crashes immediately when trying to type, and many other things end up crashing. This may not be a problem to all, but to me it was and should be noted. This does have an LED to those who care about that little helpful feature, however it is not able to be used for anything other than battery purposes, so you don't get anything very helpful from it. There is the feature Moto Display which shows your notifications on the screen in a specific way and there are settings for you to mess with. Over all this phone is a very great phone for the price and something that people can greatly appreciate for a low budget.",25 Apr 2016
Motorola Moto G (3rd Generation) No Contract Phone (Virgin Mobile) - Retail Packaging,The Moto G is a significant upgrade over the Galaxy S2,4.0 ,Chris Frost,,"So far, I'm very happy with this phone. The 8GB of internal memory is actually 4.54 gb of usable storage. I was worried that it wouldn't be sufficient for my needs but after installing my favorite apps I still have 2 gb left over. This phone replaced my 4 year old Galaxy S2. Comparing the two phones is like apples and oranges. Yes they are both phones but the Moto G does everything better than the S2 even if it has less internal memory (The S2 has 16GB) and lacks the NFC feature of the S2. The trade off is more than worth it. The Moto is faster, takes higher quality photos (in daylight) with a faster shutter speed, the speakerphone is really loud, and the battery life is amazing. After a full day of use my battery only dropped down to 70%. I didn't play any video games or use FB during that time but I did watch You Tube and used other apps that would have killed the battery on my S2 in less than 3 hours.",24 Mar 2016
"Viviscal Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Tablets, 90-Tablets",I Like Viviscal,4.0 ,S Matthews,,"I have been using Viviscal for a little over a month now, and it is a nice natural product, it is basically a vitamin for your hair. I use it together with Minoxigaine Minoxigaine by Hairgenics FDA Approved Hair Growth Formula with 5% Minoxidil Plus Powerful DHT Blockers which is a combination of rogaine's minoxidil with other hair growth ingredients that really work, I definitely notice less shedding and some new hair growth.",18 Dec 2017
"Viviscal Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Tablets, 90-Tablets",Suspicious of Product Authenticity,1.0 ,L_H,,"I've been using this on and off for a few years. I noticed in the last year it was not working as well, my hair was not growing as fast. I read other reviews stating it wasn't the same product as sold by the company or say another distributor like Walgreens or CVS. I went to Walgreens to purchase and sure enough the pills look, taste, and smell differently. I saw more results in less than one month of taking the pills from the store than I did in 3 months with the ones from Amazon.",19 Dec 2016
"Viviscal Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Tablets, 90-Tablets",NOT THE SAME ITEM SOLD BY OTHER OFFICIAL VIVISCAL RETAILERS. RIP OFF.,1.0 ,Amazon Customer,,"I do not believe the item being sold here is the authentic Viviscal Extra Strength Pill. I read the reviews before purchasing, which questioned the authenticity of this product, but chose to ignore it since the vendor was viviscal. BIG MISTAKE. While packaging may change, and the items with older packaging are commonly reduced in price; i do not believe this is the same product as what is sold from other vivscal retailers. First, after taking this product for 3.5 weeks, I saw no change in hair loss. Second, after taking this product for 3.5 weeks I developed a horribly dry/rashy scalp. It was unbearably dry, flaky, and itchy. I decided to stop taking viviscal. My scalp eventually recovered. believing this product not to be the real deal, I purchased it at Target for $35.00. The packing is almost exactly the same but as mentioned in a previous review, the lot numbers are different. Amazon viviscal is alpha numerical, and targets in just numerical. The pill packaging is different which could fall under the packaging my vary description. The biggest and most disturbing difference is in the pill itself. The pills from target which is a verified Viviscal retailer, are denser, a totally different color and have a grainier look to it. This made me wonder what did I buy from Amazon? The pills look and smell different despite the Supplement Facts being EXACTLY the same. I have no idea what I was ingesting believing it to be Viviscal, and I would strongly recommend that NO ONE buys this from Amazon. Target might be a little bit more but it is worth it for an authentic product that does not potentially give you an awful reaction!",30 Jul 2017

I have called their attention to one that uses MY IMAGE without authorization (username: Kate, who has also posted a number of other seemingly false reviews on numerous unrelated products), and Amazon has refused to take it down.

"Viviscal Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Tablets, 90-Tablets",Ireland-made pills are better if you can secure them. Watch out for breakouts!,3.0 ,Renee,,"It's been about 20 days and I've only been taking one a day (at night) because the tablets were causing my skin to break out a lot. I'm not sure if I've noticed a difference but a good friend said my hair texture was less frizzy. My nails are super strong and long, however. I am confident that I'll see improvement in my hair with continued use. Update: The pills in first batch I ordered were wide and flat and made in Ireland (supposedly). I definitely have noticed a difference in my hair quality since I've been taking them. Just ordered my second box and the packaging looks like a knockoff, as well as the pills being smaller in diameter and thicker and made in the US (supposedly). I emailed Viviscal the lot numbers and expiration dates so hopefully they can confirm which batch is real. I will be returning these pills pending their response. There is a reason the price is significantly cheaper than the pills at the store. (First order is the box/pills on the right and the lot number on the bottom; second order is left/top. I think the second one is the fake.) Update #2: I checked the lot numbers and expiration dates with the company and they told me that both boxes were legit but they have two factories, which would account for the differences in the pills. However, the second box (made in the US) is giving me really bad, unrelenting acne. The first box from Ireland also caused breakouts but that subsided after a week or so whereas this time it won't stop. If I can consistently get the pills made in Ireland, I'll keep taking them cause they definitely do seem to be making some difference. If not, the acne is a dealbreaker.",28 Mar 2016
"Viviscal Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Tablets, 90-Tablets",Pills turned Black,1.0 ,Amazon Customer,,"Please do not buy, these are fake, only God knows what they actually put in these pills for human consumption, pills began turning black after a few days of opening.

Cuisinart MCP193-18N MultiClad Pro Stainless Steel 3-Quart Saucepan with Cover,Great Cookware!,5.0 ,Ang,,"I've had a set of this cookware for 3 years now and use it every day. The best as far as I'm concerned. Some have complained about how it looks after being used and oxidation occurring saying it's ""flaking"". Stainless Steel is a metal not a coating. I just can't see how it can ""flake"" off. In the research I did on stainless cookware before I chose these I found that it's a common/normal thing that happens with this type cookware. Bar Keepers Friends does a fantastic job of restoring these to like new condition. I use mine every day and I've never done anything to be extra careful while doing so. I got them to cook for my family and that's what I do. These spots don't hinder the function of these at all, it's merely cosmetic. However, having said that if you want your pans to always look brand new and unused and don't want to use a ""toxic"" cleaner I suggest you do what I just did and use plain old household vinegar for the same results. If I can figure out how I will post a photo of before and after a couple minutes of vinegar. I just added a very small amount of vinegar, about 2 T probably, swished it around let it sit for a minute, applied a sponge, rinsed, dried and bam see next photo. Like new shiny. Yes it probably has a few scratches but that too is normal after 3 years of use I'd imagine.",08 Sep 2015
Cuisinart MCP193-18N MultiClad Pro Stainless Steel 3-Quart Saucepan with Cover,Great Value,5.0 ,SMDEE,,"I was looking for a set of stainless sauce pans to replace my very aged Magnalite aluminum set which has pitted badly. I wanted fully clad stainless cookware. I looked at All-Clad Stainless, Cuisinart Multiclad Pro, Calphalon Triply, and the Tramontina Triply. I wanted a rolled lip to make pouring easier so that eliminated the All-Clad and Tramontina entries. Not sure which of the remaining two I wanted, I bought one each of the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro and the Calphalon Triply Stainless to test. After using each about a half dozen times, I was pleased with the performance of both. Neither seems to have any significant performance advantage over the other. Both heated evenly, were solidly built, and were comfortable to lift and pour. Neither handle heated too much during cooking even after simmering tomato sauce for hours. The Cuisinart's handle was warmer than the Calphalon but not by much. I did find the Calphalon slightly easier to clean food that had become stuck to the surface. However, that was negated by having a third handle rivet to clean around. Essentially, performance was the same from both lines. For those that are concerned with the appearance of the cookware, the Cuisinart Multiclad line has a brushed finish. The Calphalon Triply are polished to a mirror finish. Both were fine with me as I don't much worry about how they look. I chose the Cuisinart sauce pans for a few reasons: lids, pan sizes, and price. I like the Cuisinart's metal lids more than the Calphalon's glass ones. I don't understand the benefit of glass lids. They can't take the higher heats that metal can, can break if dropped or banged, and fog up when used so you can't see what's in the pot, anyway. The sauce pans in the Cuisinart line are available in 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 quart sizes. That's perfect for my needs. The Calphalon was availabe in 1, 1.5, 2.5, and 4.5 quart sizes. I really wanted something in the 3-3.5 quart range since I use it frequently but it is not available from Calphalon. They do make a 3 quart Chef's pan but I didn't want the curved bottom. The Cuisinart Multiclad sauce pans are priced approximately 50% less than the Calphalon Triply pans. Since they performed evenly well, the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro seemed to fit my needs best.",16 Jan 2013
Cuisinart MCP193-18N MultiClad Pro Stainless Steel 3-Quart Saucepan with Cover,Narrowed it down to this and a few others? THIS IS THE ONE.,5.0 ,Bradley,,"We bought this to broaden our culinary horizons. After my usual weeks of constantly reading into reviews and Youtubing, I decided this HAD to be what I had been searching for. The Cuisinart multiclad pro 12 piece set has turned me into the man of the kitchen I've always wanted to be. The days of ""toss whatever frozen meal bag in a non stick pan and let's eat"" are over for me. The first night we used them on come chicken breast, steamed some carrots, and made a brown sugar glaze for them. The even browning of the multiclad technology was incredible. This set makes me feel like I CAN make more than just something to eat, were actually making delicious meals and it created a ""drive"" to cook better because we know we are capable now! I can now see that stainless steel really does cook food better than non stick. The one thing I really thought would kill me is the pain of cleanup every night. We use this for all of the food we cook daily and as you fellow avid reviewers may have read, Bar Keepers Friend really what you've heard! I've used this skillet daily for a few weeks now and hot water, BKF, and a little scrubbing and they clean up great and HONESTLY quite easily. We've cooked everything with coconut oil and that stuff really makes a great oil. No sticky burnt food, just lightly stuck browned bits that can make a great pan sauce! Which is a great first step to cleaning! Using what you got! I honestly love this set and it deserves every 4-5 star review its got. You'll love this set.",09 Feb 2015

DYMO LabelManager 280 Rechargeable Hand-Held Label Maker (1815990),Nice handheld label printer with QWERTY keyboard.,4.0 ,Nathan Kull,,"Most of the handheld label printers are built using ABC keybaords vs. the QWERTY keyboard, and that was a key factor in my decision to buy this scanner. Some people have claimed that using DYMO label makers vs. Brother label makers will save money as the DYMO does waste less label when printing, this is both true and false --- I will explain more further down in this review. I would like to add to this review a comment about batteries, there has been multiple comments about this label maker ""eating batteries""; I have used up trial cartridge and many labels into my second cartridge and have not changed the batteries in this unit. I am using Eneloop Rechargeable batteries and they have performed flawlessly. Keep in mind that this would be a higher drain type of device when printing and cheap ""Super Duty"" (Non-alkaline or cheap Rechargeable) batteries are probably not going to work well. As always, I recommend the investment in Eneloop batteries with a good charger (LaCrosse BC-700) PROs: - Handheld form factor - Easy to use - Prints nice looking labels - QWERTY Keyboard CONs: - NO access to any special charactors except via menus (i.e. if you need a ""-"" or a ""."" on your label, there is NO button for this and you have to go into the symbol menu to find the symbol you want) ... This is annoying and is the reason that this label maker looses one star (most of my labels include ""-"" or ""."" in them) **************************************************************************************** *** The truth about actual label costs (Pictures will be attached to this review) *** **************************************************************************************** I printed out labels using a Brother P-Touch PT-2030 and the DYMO LabelManager 160 and these were the results of my findings: As of the time of this writing, the DYMO 1/2"" D-1 label roll is selling for $14 and includes 23 feet (276 inches) of label As of the time of this writing, the Brother 1/2"" P-Touch label roll is selling for $11 and includes 26.2 feet (314 inches) of label I printed two labels that had this text in 24pt BOLD ""TEST-XX-01"" The DYMO label that was printed including wasted space on both sides was 2.75"" in length which would allow 100 labels to be printed on a $14 roll *** $0.14 per label The Brother label that was printed including wasted space on both sides was 4"" in length which would allow 78 labels to be printed on the $11 roll *** $0.14 per label *** TIE *** I printed two labels that had this text in 24pt BOLD ""255.255.255.255"" The DYMO label that was printed including wasted space on both sides was 3.375"" (3 3/8"") in length which would allow 81 labels on $14 roll *** $0.17 per label The Brother label that was printed including wasted space on both sides was 4.5"" in length which would allow 69 labels on a $11 roll *** $0.16 per label *** BROTHER WINS *** The DYMO would win with smaller labels, it seems that my first label tested is about the tie breaker in size. Bottom line: If you print SMALL labels, you will get more for your money using a DYMO label printer with less waste per label If you print larger labels, you will get more for your money using a BROTHER label printer even though it waste more per label The DYMO generally prints more labels per roll than the brother, even though there is less label per cart, however the Brother label is cheaper at this time. There is also the consideration that you might be ok with the extra tape used by the dymo, and that you might hate how much extra tape is used with the brother, ... How much time might you spend trimming brother labels because they are huge? They are both great label makers ... I hope this review helps someone make an informed decision!",23 Mar 2012

I've used a ton of label makers and this on is far and above passes them all! OK so the symbols are on a separate button bug deal.. It's the perfect size It prints super clear It has a button for clip art designs and pictures! It can write multiple lines on a single strip! It has borders you can select to put around the text! It can write horizontal and vertical! The font sizes go from 8-20 on 1/2 inch tape with selection of 2 in between! The price is 9 dollars! And it comes with tape! Don't listen to these people complaining of things like ""it's such a pain to need symbols"" blah blah blah. Just grab this and a 2 pack of 23 foot long rolls and you'll love the thing! I promise!

No, you're not going to print out a letter to grandma, but you can create your label on your computer screen (which is easier than typing it directly into the labeler) and the coolest thing (at least with my MacBook Air) I can print a label out using any font that's on my computer!!

It is also so cheap as an Add-on item as well, how can anyone complain? The quality is just as nice or nicer than most business card holders I see within public office spaces. The black metal mesh is much nicer than other plastic options. This really is a good item, and I am sure others will find other uses for this as I have; as it is very sturdy, lightweight, and cheap. When I decide not to use it as a cell phone stand, I will repurpose it as a normal business card holder.

"Rolodex Deep Desk Drawer Organizer, Metal Mesh, Black (22131)",I like this design for many reasons,5.0 ,Courtney Toombs,,"I work for a hotel and I purchased this to use there. The drawer organizer that we had previously was relatively small, I decided to purchase this one due to the dimensions of the small, square spaces. I was looking for something that would hold our room key cards and envelopes well and it looks as though I have found it! I like this design for many reasons, firstly with the mesh design it will be much easier to clean out compared to more solid materials. Working in a space where several other people work, there is bound to be bits of dust and dirt getting into things, with this it'll be much easier to keep it clean. Also, with the size of the two larger compartments, there is ample space for everything that we keep in the drawer. Not only can we fit all of our writing utensils into one compartment, we can keep larger things such as our scissors in the other, which is something we couldn't do with our smaller organizer. As I mentioned previously, I was looking for an organizer that would hold our key cards and envelopes. The four smaller compartments are perfect, I like that this comes with a little insert for one of the smaller compartments because it's great for holding paper clips. Overall, this is a wonderful drawer organizer, it's a tid bit larger than I was expecting, but it is absolutely perfect for what I was needing it for.",05 Oct 2015

As you can see from my photo, I have a place for everything with four small compartments in front and two large ones in back. I keep my keys in there now so they don't get lost!

Comprehensive review ahead, skip to the end if you just want my overall opinion ~ Packaging - It was delivered with another item, and it was loose with the drawer attached with plastic along with a tag. It was padded with big plastic bubbles, and there was no damage from shipment. As a cool bonus I got this the day after I ordered it even though I had 2-day shipping. Quality - The metal mesh is sturdy and feels like it will hold up over time and use. One note - the drawer is very loose and will fall out if you pick up the organizer and tilt it forward at all, so be careful if you're moving it full of supplies. Usefulness - The compartments are big enough to fit several pencils and pens on the sides, and on the top they are shallow and suitable for things like erasers and replacement staples. The drawer is roomy and will fit lots of sticky notes, but will not fit standard 3x5 index cards. Overall, this should fit the average student's needs.

Uvex Skyper Blue Light Blocking Computer Glasses with SCT-Orange Lens (S1933X),Blocks the blue so your body naturally produces melatonin - just be careful with a few things,5.0 ,DF,,"As an amateur astronomer, I've done a lot of research about light pollution. That led me to research about how light affects sleep. Here's the summed-up version so you don't need to read all those scientific papers I have: - Blue light is great for being awake - that's why you wake up with a blue sky (read about melanopsin and melatonin on Wikipedia) - Blue light is not good for sleep; in the 470 nanometers range, that suppresses melatonin (a key hormone for sleeping well) - Humans (and other animals) evolved to sleep in the dark - or, at the darkest, full Moonlight (just 0.1-0.3 lux of light) - Longer wavelengths of light were the only source of light at night for most of human history (fire / candles) - Tablets / phones / screens / LED's and many CFL bulbs have strong blue wavelengths that are messing with our circadian rhythms and suppressing melatonin, because they have wavelengths shorter than 530nm - 540nm So what to do in our modern world? Wear these glasses before bed. Natural melatonin production would have occurred with our ancestors starting with the onset of sunset. Wavelengths of light from the setting sun would have shifted to red, and fire or candles were usually the only form of light available. Those are both relatively dim, and in longer wavelengths. Today, our ""connected"" world has a LOT of blue light. It's messing with our sleep patterns, because our bodies evolved to only see red/orange/yellow light at night, NOT blue light/shorter wavelenghts. THESE GLASSES BLOCK THOSE MELATONIN SUPPRESSING WAVELENGTHS. Put them on a couple hours before bed. For me, I start getting drowsy about 90 minutes after wearing them. The trick is DO NOT take them off without closing your eyes or being in a dark room (a room with ONLY a dim red light would work too, as your melanopsin won't trigger melatonin suppression with red light). So when changing for bed, close your eyes when removing your shirt if you have to pull it off over your head or put your night time clothing on. Then leave these on until you turn out the light for sleep. And be sure to sleep in the dark too, or wear a sleep mask. Small amounts of light can still affect your melatonin (well, anything brighter then full Moonlight - yes, even a blue LED on your computer). You can watch TV with these on, check your phone, read your tablet, work on your laptop - just note that colors will look weird. Blue looks black. Yellow looks white. Greens look weird. And the glasses aren't exactly stylish. But if you sleep better, who cares? They work. And while you're at it, make sure your home's lights (and business if you own one) aren't shining into other people's homes or apartments. Too much light at night is what makes these things necessary in the first place. We don't need all this light at night; these glasses are just a band aid to help; what we really need is smarter outdoor lighting - aimed down, at the ground, at the proper color(s) so we aren't suppressing others melatonin. According to a Harvard study, the U.S. loses $63 BILLION dollars per year due to American's insomnia. Artificial light at night messing up people's sleep is undoubtedly part of that - let's fix that so these glasses aren't as necessary. Oh, and did these glasses work for me? An emphatic YES, they did. 5 nights (so far) of excellent sleep and well-rested mornings. And I am NOT a morning person! They work - just use them the right way, and be sure you're not doing other things that might hurt sleep (too much caffeine, lack of / too much exercise right before bed, sleep apnea, etc.) So if it's not a medical condition, do the right things, wear these, and get better sleep.",16 Sep 2014

Uvex Skyper Blue Light Blocking Computer Glasses with SCT-Orange Lens (S1933X),Sleeping well and waking happy! My chronic sleep problems have been resolved!,5.0 ,AE,,"I can sleep at last! These orange Uvex Skyper glasses worn every evening - in combination with the Luminette Bright Light Theraply Glasses worn every morning - have totally transformed my life! Prior to buying these two items my sleep cycle had been appallingly since uni days. Years of working on a laptop all night in a brightly lit office had ruined my body's ability to regulate its sleep. I'd be bursting with energy at midnight, and then still powering away at dawn. It was easy to stay awake for 36 hours at time, but almost impossible to sleep. Mornings were just awful, and I'd feel lacklustre all day ... until about 7pm when my energy levels would begin to rise again. Over the years I had often tried to reform my sleep, but without any success; clearly, my brain was simply not producing melatonin. A few months ago I decided to start an experiment to see if cutting out blue light at night, and then adding bright blue light in the mornings, could overcome the chronic sleep problems. The science seemed valid, so I hoped it would work on me. I bought both the Uvex Skyper orange glasses (to block blue light in the evenings) and the Luminette glasses (to simulate bright daylight in the mornings) and used both diligently every day as part of a program to reform my sleep. Here's what I experienced. 1. Within a couple of weeks of wearing the Uvex Skyper glasses I started getting sleepy at around 11pm, like normal people do!! 2. After just a few mornings of wearing the Luminette glasses I began to enjoy waking up. I couldn't wait to pop on my ""happy glasses"" as they made me feel wonderful! Now, more than 2 months later, I wake every morning around 7am feeling bright and cheerful. 3. The quality of my sleep has been completely transformed. Only three months ago I would wake every half hour and then lie awake for another two or three hours; now I sleep soundly the whole night through! Based upon my experience, here are the key conclusions I'd to share with others. * If an inability to wind down or fall asleep is your main problem, then the orange Uvex Skyper glasses (around $9) should be your first purchase - because if you can kick-start your melatonin production at night, then you will sleep better and wake happier. * However, if you struggle to wake up and you feel sluggish for hours afterwards, then the Luminette glasses could be transformational for you (as they were for me). I used to hate mornings ... and now I love them! * You still need to be sufficiently self disciplined to use the specs diligently. E.g. if I forget to wear the orange glasses for a few nights, then my old habit of staying awake all night quickly returns. I'm writing this review jointly for the Uvex Skyper Blue Light Blocking Glasses (for evenings) and the Luminette 2 SAD Bright Light Therapy Glasses (for mornings) because I used both over the same time period and it isn't really possible to tell which of them has contributed most to resolving my sleep and wake problems.",17 Oct 2017

Mine degraded without me noticing and the actual solid bar started to push against my doorframe. Now my doorframe is damaged. I recommend putting a sock between the doorframe and the bar to provide more padding for protection.

The photo demonstrates how the unit hangs, and I'm about 0.25"" shy of fitting. Sigh. Also, this product probably won't work on anything other than flat molding: the top bar is only 0.75"" and probably doesn't provide enough offset for decorative moldings, which would probably get crushed. These size limitations aren't on Amazon's web site or in the manual, which I read before unpacked the product; this is clearly a vendor miss.

Iron Gym Total Upper Body Workout Bar,"Pull-ups, pull-ups, pull-ups",5.0 ,Bill,,"I'm very happy with this. It fits my frame perfectly. I have done approx 600 pull-ups on it in 2 weeks. It has not weakened or degraded and has left no marks as of yet on my door frame. Assembly was super easy. I am 170 lbs and it holds me well. For what I paid I couldn't ask for more. *Update* The soft hand grips are beginning to wear. At this point I have roughly 2,000 pull-ups on it with continued daily use. The hand grips are the only noticeable sign of wear on the unit. The outboard rubber pads have now left faint black marks on my white door frame which I assume will clean off with soapy water. Still I am impressed with this budget pull-up bar.",15 Feb 2016
Iron Gym Total Upper Body Workout Bar,Do not feel safe using it!,1.0 ,Amazon Customer,,"I read the reviews and thought this might be a great addition for my morning work outs. I assembled it as instructed and placed the wedge on the correct side of the frame. The bars are not flush and noticebly off, when trying to seat the flat side aginst the frame, one side is braced and the other not sitting flat. In trying to adjust it, the flimsy wedge broke, and I am at my wits end to figure it out. I cant, so next step is to call the service number included in the package and I was sent to voicemail with a full mailbox.

"Oster Cordless Electric Wine Bottle Opener with Foil Cutter, FFP",3 YEARS later......#amazeballs,5.0 ,DaveyG,,"I ordered this for my smokin' hot GF back in 2012... fast forward 3 years later -- this $20 wine opener is still with me and my smokin' hot GF is now my smokin' hot wife. I never thought either one would be with me for this long... but life is good. We like to have a good time... I mean...we effin' get down on some wine. So this bad boy probably pops open a new bottle every 2 days. It has stayed plugged in to our wall for over 3 years now (I halfway expected the battery would have burned out by now, but nope!). We haven't even had to replace the screw yet --- still works like new --- I'm shocked and impressed this $20 opener has faithfully lasted this long. Often times you get what you pay for (I know b/c I'm cheap... like... the OG of cheap) --- but this is an exception to that rule --- I have no idea why anyone would pay $50+ for another ""more recognizable"" brand --- this is packed with all the quality you could ever need. I probably sound like a sound like a PR rep from Oster, but I had to write a review of this little guy when I saw him sitting unrighteously unreviewed in my past orders.",25 Jun 2015
"Oster Cordless Electric Wine Bottle Opener with Foil Cutter, FFP",Great while it lasted,3.0 ,LopsidedMidget,,"I really liked this opener. It worked really well and looked pretty sleek. I'm in the unique position where I've purchased quite of few of these as gifts for family members and two for myself (my family loves wine). Why two for myself? Well, as it gets older the batter stops holding a charge quite like it used to and we had one run out battery with a cork in it. I'm sure that you're sitting there thinking ""LopsidedMidget, don't be a dummy. Just recharge it and *poof* you are absolved of your issue."" This would be true.. with nearly any other brand. However, Oster charges by sitting on the stand and a cork gets in the way of that happening. You either have to take the whole thing apart, or invest in a new opener once this happens to you. Of the five that I have purchased for myself and family only one of them is still functional - and that's because my father quit drinking a year ago. So, why do I still give it three stars? Well, it's $20 and works well until it's inevitable failure. You'll very likely get between 1-2 years out of this guy (hopefully) and you won't regret your purchase once you use it... until you need to open wine and don't have an opener.. I've since moved on and now use the Onzeri one and have realized that this Oster model feels a lot more solid. The Ozeri sounds/feels like it's wheezing out its final breath whenever we use it to open wine. It has lasted longer, but it's feels like it has the motivation of a teenager being forced to do its chores whenever we use it. The saving grace for the Ozeri is that the charge is a cable that attaches to the outside and it doesn't rely on a base to do this, so even if it does with a cork in it we can still charge the opener and eject the cork.",26 Feb 2016
"Oster Cordless Electric Wine Bottle Opener with Foil Cutter, FFP",Don't bother. Horrible Customer Service. Poor Product.,1.0 ,thomas b.,,"When I first saw this wine opener I had a, ""I've got to have it moment."" After purchasing this item I was in heaven, opening wine bottles was a breeze, the foil cutter is awesome, and I love the long battery life on this opener. I loved this product so much I bought multiple for gifts for friends/family members. 6 months later, the down button (which removes the cork from the bottle) stops working, knowing that Oster aka Sunbeam Products aka Jarden Consumer Solutions has a 1 year limited warranty (stated in product manual) I wasn't worried. I emailed customer service about my issue, 3 weeks later I got a response requesting information in order to process the return. The same day I respond to the email with all the information asked, another week goes by without a response. I email customer service to make sure they received my email with all my information and not only did they let me know they did receive my email but the product was ""no longer covered under warranty"". I responded to customer service with the exact words from their handbook stating that their product has a one year warranty and have yet to get a response. So if you are thinking about purchasing this wine opener, keep scanning for something else. This is not the one for you. TLDR; Don't buy this product, it is not made well and customer service isn't interested in fulfilling their warranty.",29 Jan 2018

Shake Weight Dumbell,Good product,5.0 ,Kai Opaka,,"Excellent lightweight dumbbell. Purchased for spouse (and myself) to tone our aging arms a bit.

We could see and feel a difference after three days of use and after consistent use now for weeks, the old arms look much better. Less sag to the skin and more muscle definition.",08 Oct 2014
Shake Weight Dumbell,Amazing!,5.0 ,David Marr,,"I've only been using for a couple days and I am already noticing a tremendous difference! It is so convenient and easy to use! I have been using it lately in one hand while cleaning my house! Right away I noticed my triceps getting better, and I have been experimenting in different positions and now my chest and biceps are getting better as well! And it's small enough I could carry it in my backpack for travel! It's fun and addictive, I use it a little here and a little there throughout the day and it really adds up! I always stay sore too so my muscles are always growing. It definitely can work triceps (most easily) but through experimenting different positions you will find that shoulders, biceps and pecs can be done as well. The one thing that it does not touch (much) in the upper body appears (so far) to be stomach, so basically with some sit ups you will hit everything in your upper body. Since it connects to your arm there really isn't a way for it to do stomach, but it hits absolutely everything else fabulously. To the orders that have said ""it get's stuck"" no it doesn't, they aren't doing it right. The movement is precise if you are doing it just right, but it shakes even if it is a little off. If you are doing it 100% right it shakes great back and forth, if you are a little off it doesn't shake as much but still works you out. Whatever muscle is tightening seems to be the muscle that is getting the workout. DVD is very helpful too as a starter but you will think of your own positions as well, and you will like some of your own positions better. I like tightening my biceps different ways to make sure biceps are worked good. Overall very happy!",10 Feb 2014

It really doesnt do what it they show it doing in the commercial, I mean, it does shake, if you do it just right, but it is not going to be enough movement or tension for you really to see any kind of results. Youre better off just using normal weights, or even resistance bands, which is what I moved onto. Save your money on this one.",12 Jan 2018

Shake Weight Dumbell,Shake Weight Does Give you a Work Out,5.0 ,Lori Morin Wright,,"When I first heard about the shake weight dumbell, I thought it was a joke. Then I read about it and watched the video and saw that it would work in the areas that MY arms/shoulders need help with. I found it available thru Amazon.com (the actual shake weight site was too much $$$). When I use the dumbell, I can really feel the arms (upper, lower, flabby parts) truly are getting the muscles going and I have noticed some toning since beginning with it. 6 minutes a day doesn't sound like a lot, but when you start with this and haven't worked on your arms in a very long time, it feels tiring and as if you have been working those arms for an hour or so. I think I began at 2 minutes a day and have to reach the full 6 minutes in intervals over a 15 minutes period :) (If I was much younger, I probably wouldn't really need something like this to tone my arms and upper body, but being in my 50's, this seems to work for me.)",23 Mar 2011

At first, the exercises are a little difficult but the more you do them, obviously the easier they get. For as much effort as you have to put into it, you get more than double the results.

Once unpacked I plugged it into my home stereo receiver and tried out a few records. I recommend using external speakers if possible since the on-board speakers are small, and you are listening to vinyl. The reason I am giving 4 stars is that this unit is very light and the switches could have a stronger more friendly design. The briefcase top also comes very close to the bottom of the playing album.

Ninja Professional Blender (BL610),"Great blender, excellent customer service",5.0 ,japanvle,,"I bought this blender exactly 1 year ago and I am now writing my review on it. I never write reviews but my experience with Ninja's customer service was so exceptional that I felt compelled to write one. I'll start by saying the Ninja is an excellent blender for $70. I blend frozen fruit with it every single day. It pulverizes everything into a smooth drink every time. About 1 week ago, for an unknown reason, my blender stopped working; when I went to turn it on the power button just started blinking instead. I wasn't sure what this meant so I emailed Ninja. The representative was kind, attentive, and replied to my emails extremely promptly (sometimes within minutes). I let him know what happened, and all he asked me for was: 1) the blender model number 2) where I purchased the blender and the approximate date of purchase 3) the warranty number (which happens to be just a 4 digit number engraved on the prongs which plug-in to your electrical outlet) As soon as I gave him that information, he emailed me with a confirmation-of-shipment of a new pitcher along with a tracking number. The new pitcher arrived in 3 business days and my blender is working like new again (I never figured out what was wrong with the old pitcher or why it was preventing my blender from turning on). I love companies that provide exceptional customer service and I will never purchase another blender other than Ninja. Thank you Ninja!",15 May 2017

Ninja Professional Blender (BL610),Smoothie magic,5.0 ,The Wheels Go Round,,"There are some products that just change your life. I wanted to get in on the smoothie thing, and there simply is no other way to do it than with a blender, and no better blender to do it with. The blender is mostly plastic, but it doesn't feel cheap. It is very secure. It locks onto the base with a satisfying click. The lid locks down with a similar click. Unless you have heard both clicks, the blender won't start. And good thing. The blades are very sharp. They are angled to create a vortex that instantly turns any fruits and vegetables inside into viscous liquid. I like that the spout has a lid that locks open so you can pour easily. The blades come out so that they can be cleaned easily, along with the inside of the decanter. I saw that another buyer was cut when the blades ""flew out"" during cleaning. I have looked carefully and my blade assembly does not appear to be capable of flight or even mild levitation. Nonetheless I lift it out carefully, and if I am going to use the blender again I just rinse the blades; if I want the blades completely clean I use the dishwasher and not my hands. It has been a long time since I used a blender. I stopped because they sucked. Old blenders leaked out the bottom. They were hard to clean. They had a ton of different buttons for blending speed with labels that required a thesaurus next to the cookbook. And however I parsed the gradations of perturbation between ""emulsify"" and ""macerate"", they didn't actually blend. What was at the bottom of the blender became angry and confused while whatever was in the top two thirds of the decanter remained beatifically serene. This blender has high, medium, and low settings. You can pulse. It is loud, which I take to be a feature and not a drawback. Even more than my espresso machine, this blender is extremely effective at ending unwanted conversations. For particularly persistent interlocutors, use the pulse setting. Neither my kids nor I particularly like fruits and vegetables and as a result we don't get nearly enough. And yet I can put in 10 bananas, two cartons of strawberries, two of blueberries, a bag of spinach (yes, spinach!), a cup of plain Greek yogurt, one interrupted conversation ... and: ambrosia! The decanter is huge, and yet between the three of us we can and do empty it in one meal. Yay!",02 Aug 2016
Ninja Professional Blender (BL610),Blender jar exploded!,1.0 ,girlinpinkwaders,,"I've had my Ninja for about 18 months. I loved it. Used primarily for smoothies with frozen fruit. The other day it exploded on me and tore a hole through it. I have contacted Ninja. They didn't seem too concerned about it, and when I pressed them and offered to send them the defective blender jar so they could figure out the defect, they didn't seem very interested. The email they gave me was incorrect so I have to call them again to try and pursue this. I don't want another one, I just want them check it out because obviously there is an issue.",23 Jul 2017
Ninja Professional Blender (BL610),"Poor Plastic, broke within 8 months with little usage! DO NOT RECOMMEND! Costly warranty.",1.0 ,PHIA N VANG,,"Bought on October 6, 2016. One of the clip that locks the lid on broke off after minimal usage. The broken clip prevents the blender lid from locking and deactivating the safety, rendering the blender useless. Their warranty states that I will have to pay $19.95 to cover the cost of returning a replacement, factor in the cost to ship the broken blender to them, that would be 40-45% of the original purchase price. I would not recommend this blender. Stick with glass container versus plastic.",04 Jun 2017
