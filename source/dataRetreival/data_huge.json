She had worn it so hard there were holes underneath the handles. I have moments where I love having a cheap chicken purse ( I believe I purchased it for about 20 back before this purse exploded on here-- surprised they bumped it to $40... IDK if its worth that price personally), as opposed to a designer bag worth hundred of thousands of dollars-- and this purse makes people smile! This is def a novelty purse, the zipper on the top is kinda small ( the opening in general). Makes it hard to grab aroung in the bag, might be easier to have 2-3pouches in there with all your things in them. That way you could just pull a pouch out, instead of fishing in your bag with one hand.The lining inside is a pale yellow, gets dirty real fast--black would be perfect. Out of all the bags I have, some designer some not, this bag gets me the most compliments, even Nordstrom sales people love it, go figure!",

The opening is small, that is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, it's hard to get anything out of this purse. I took it out in public as soon as I got it ( even though my sister begged me not to take it ) and the compliments began right away. I have had so many compliments on this purse that I lost count long ago. Not very long into the day, my sister was holding my purse for me and even sat it on her side of the tabletop of the restaurant we lunched at. I am not really interested in carrying the same cookie cutter purse the rest of the world has and this purse has put smiles on so many faces ( yes, one or two of them have been mean ones ) that I really look forward to going places with it. This little purse is a conversation starter and just seems to make people happy seeing it.

It makes me super happy every time I see it, causes spontaneous conversation, and amusement to everyone else who sees it as well. I have two complaints, first the opening is too fricking small, which is incredibly frustrating, given that it's roomy and so much more should fit in it than does. Second, it would be more aesthetically pleasing if a small amount of material/foam/whatever were in the head so that my poor chicken doesn't look so smooshed. Lastly, a previous reviewer extolled the virtues of the spacious handles, easily accommodating over the shoulder wear, even in a bulky winter cloak. If you purchased as a fat person, expecting it to fit over your arm, alas, it may not. I am still ridiculously happy with my stupid handbag, regardless.",

My only dislike is the length/size of the zip opening on top of the bag - it is 6 inches (15cm). To put a regular size ladies wallet or an umbrella inside the bag, I had to slip the item in sideways (not length-wise). I think it will be hard to have to maneuver an item to it's shorter side inside the bag just to take it out of the bag. And of course if you have \"big\" hands, it will be a struggle to get your hand even inside the bag. Even with my hands (XS Gloves American-Size), it was not easy for me.

But as we looked more into it and we liked it. We were going to put all of the stuff in the purse but the whole/ zipper was too small you could not put anything in it. The purse also had a really insane smell. But for women who don't like big purses with small wholes I do not recommend this for you. Even though it is really cool it looks like a pretty good chicken the only problem is that it has a lot of space you can\u2019t put your things in there. I think it just needs to shrink in size and open the zipper more and it will be fine and pleas get rid of the smell.",

All in all great bag, do not regret this decision, and I love taking it with me out to bars or social events, everyone loves it..

Then I posted it on my good friend's wall and got a reply of \"That's Beautiful\" , meant it in a sarcastic way I'm sure. Then for fun I searched on Amazon to see if this purse was offered and there it was! We live a quite a distance apart, occasionally, I like to send her some strange gift in the mail just to let her know I'm thinking of her. This item fit the bill and it was on sale for a good price. So I placed the order and waited. She received and messaged me \"Are you kidding me?!\" She then posted a photo of herself with the purse on Facebook, her friends, and even her mother, marveled and raved about the purse. Everyone was jealous! I purchased the purse as a joke, but I received an update today that the purse made a debut outing with my friend, I was so surprised, never thought she would use it. I'm sure she didn't think so either, but the novelty must have grew on her. She said 4 people commented on the purse and were very excited! The purse was well worth the money for the laughs that we got, but was even more worth it now that my friend is going to use it! I haven't seen the purse in person so I can't speak of the quality, dimensions, etc. but gift-wise, this is great!",

Or go vintage, I own an old ONKYO turntable from the 80\u2019s and it sounds great. Crosley Cruisers don\u2019t come with a pre amp, like the LP120 so you can\u2019t plug in passive speakers.

As the speakers vibrate, the needle vibrates and skips. This isn't so bad on old, thinner records from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, but newer, thicker records with better bass response will skip all over the place. So don't ever buy an all-in-one turntable, because they will all skip when playing new records. If you don't want to spend the money on a proper turntable, proper speakers, and a proper amp/receiver, then seriously reconsider whether vinyl is actually right for you, or if you are just following a trend. If you value convenience over the experience of listening to an entire album all the way through, then feel free to take advantage of the last 30 years of advancements in technology. Another FACT that you need to know is that NO, vinyl does not sound better than CDs. It doesn't sound \"warmer\" or more \"true\". Assuming perfect media conditions, then the sound quality is INDISCERNABLE by human ears. Any perception that vinyl sounds better or even different at all is entirely placebo. In double blinded studies no one has ever been able to tell the difference between CD, vinyl, and even cassette tape. So why do people think that vinyl sounds better? Why do they like vinyl if it doesn't sound any different? Well because many young people alive today have only ever experienced iTunes, mp3s and other compressed audio formats. All physical media will sound better than an mp3, becuase it hasn't been compressed (had certain frequencies and sounds removed to save disk space). As to why people would prefer vinyl even though it sounds the same, I think people are tired of not owning their music. You can buy songs piecemeal from iTunes, but you never own them. They still belong to Apple and you're just licensing it from them. They can take it away from you at any time. But if you buy an album on physical media, then it's yours. And if you're going to buy something physical, you might as well get the big one with the nice album art. If you want a nice automatic TT on a budget, go with an Audio Technica LP-60. You can even get one with USB out so you can run it through your computer if you're too cheap to buy speakers and an amp. Oh and stay away from bluetooth speakers because they compress the audio and you might as well be listening to mp3s at that point. Good luck, kids!",

However, when it comes to these portable turntables, excitement couldn't be further from our minds. They are sleek and light but beyond style they fail miserably at their primary function: playing records. The main issue with these turntables is their lack of a counter-weight at the base of the tone arm. This weight is a vital component of any record player, as it set the correct force (grip if you will) on the record with the stylus. Without this weight you will have a stylus that skates across several of your records (180g records in particular). If you plan on playing Dynoflex records exclusively then you may be able to avoid any issues. Our recommendation: buy a record player with a counter-weight.",

                "review_text": "first off -- i didn't buy this. my brother-in-law bought one for his daughter roughly 6 months ago. she brought it to me today hoping i might be able to help her with it. the problem: it plays too slow at the 33 rpm speed. the speed also sometimes varies a bit, but never gets near the proper 33 rpm. i didn't try the other speeds except to note that the 45 rpm setting is too fast for 33 rpm albums (a good thing, but i didn't test to see if it played the right speed for 45's). apparently, when new, the player held roughly the proper speed. but the motor and/or belt has been fading away over the past few months. so i went to the amazon reviews where i first noticed that a full 1/3 of the reviews are two stars or less. a good many of the complaints are in regard to faulty speed. there is obviously a quality problem here that the manufacturer is not addressing. instead, in response to so many of the reviews, they point out the obvious that if the album is rubbing against something it will play too slow. that canned response gets to be a bit tiresome after the first 6 or 7 reads. i noticed several other complaints that hold true for my niece's unit but one must admit this really isn't meant to be a high quality product. if it would play the proper speed i would give it four stars for being pretty much what you should expect from it. as is it doesn't deserve even one star as it is simply useless. other things to consider: yes the weight on the needle is quite heavy and i would not put prized vinyl underneath it. the speakers do give mediocre sound but it was good enough for the money paid. my daughter connected an oontz bluetooth speaker using the headphone jack on the phonograph and the sound was good considering the system. this was the unit without bluetooth so, again, the bluetooth speaker was connected by a cord. interesting that at the moment they are charging you $20 more for the privilege of NOT having bluetooth. color availability i suppose. some people have complained about the needle skipping . i didn't have this problem. seems to me the company would do well to drop the input sockets and the rca output sockets and put the savings into a better motor/belt.

                "review_text": "I got this as a gift and the design of the unit is very sleek. I've only had it for a day but have discovered a few things that might upset people in hindsight. --Summary-- It looks cool and sounds ok for the price you're paying. Unfortunately you need a pretty open space so the case can open up completely to prevent the record from rubbing against it. If you want higher quality when playing your records, I suggest investing in a higher end, professional turntable from Audio Technica, Numark, Pioneer, etc and plan on spending at minimum $100 (Note: these kind of turntables don't come with built in speakers). This is a fun little novelty item that's pleasing to the eye. --More Details/Helpful Tips-- 1. The case has to be fully open when playing records: I saw reviews saying that the records sounded warped or like the turntable's speed was off. I ran into the same problem at first. I tried have the case set up on a shelf with the top of the case sitting against the back of the shelf upright. I found out this was because the turntable was rubbing up against the case a bit. Once I put the turntable on the counter and leaned the top of the case as far back as it could go, the record played at its intended speed smoothly. 2. Your records have to be cleaned regularly to be played without skipping: I have a dog who sheds a ton. If there's a lot of dust/hair/particle build up on your record, the needle will skip. Google how to correctly clean your records. Once I cleaned mine off, the needle skipped a lot less often. If you're still unsatisfied after cleaning, you may need to upgrade to a better needle. 3. Speakers aren't the best: You're spending $70 on an all in one system so there you go. It won't be the greatest quality sound. The speakers don't have great bass. If they did, every hit of the kick drum would cause the needle to skip. Imagine putting a regular turntable on a sub-woofer. Just wouldn't work. If I want better sound when using it, I line out (on the back of the unit) to another sound system and get more of the frequency spectrum off my records this way.",

It suddenly jumped to max speed on irs own without any external input. Now no manipulation of the speed selector has any effect on the playing speed.

The only pitfall with the player is that it can get some belt problems, which can be easily fixed. The built in speakers are sub-par, but this can be fixed by auxing the sound to an external speaker.

The reason I am giving 4 stars is that this unit is very light and the switches could have a stronger more friendly design. The briefcase top also comes very close to the bottom of the playing album.

If you are a beginner I recommend the Audio Technica AT-LP 60. It's about $100 and WAY better than these pieces of Junk. For people who want a good turntable you're gonna have to spend at least $200-400. If that's too much for you then maybe you should find a different hobby. STAY AWAY FROM CROSLEY, they are complete junk. The world of vinyl is a fantastic place and you should invest your money wisely, but please, just don't buy one of these, they are horrible.

I read a lot of reviews saying that this was a poorly made product that was a waste of money and not worth buying. If you're just looking for a turntable to have for fun, this can be a great option. It's also very small so it's easy to store and carry. The turquoise color is adorable and has a very retro feel to it. I didn't have any problems with the needle not having enough weight on it to play. You do have to be careful when moving around the turntable when it's playing a record. If you jump or make a lot of movement it can make the needle jump a little, but that's the only \"problem\" I have found with the needle. I do wish it came with a USB port to plug in my own music, but I can't complain too much since that would defeat the purpose of the turntable itself. I think the sound is great and I had no problems with the quality of the sound. Overall, I think it's a decent record player for the price if you are looking for an introduction to records.",

I have it plugged into the line in of an old tube radio and use it to play old 78s that I have accumulated from the thrift store. It has a nice air of nostalgia to it. When audiophiles choose to listen to vinyl however, they're typically looking for the absolute best sound production that they can get, and spend big $$ for the privilege on both their equipment and music. This unit is definitely not suited for that. If you're like me though and have a collection of old records up in the attic or want to pick up some on the cheap and have a listen now and again without spending a fortune then this honestly isn't a bad choice, and it looks cool too. If you're planning on trying to get high fidelity or want to play expensive and/or rare mint condition records then this is sure to disappoint. In short, it is what it is.

I'm not crazy about the quality of the built in audio. Sometimes it comes out grainy or static-like. However, I do like that this little guy comes with a 45 adjuster! I also think its cool that you can get an aluminum 45 adjuster in the color of your turntable for $15 more. (I actually saw these at BooksAMillion.) **I did some research after I received my Crosley portable turntable and found out that Crosleys are notorious for their low quality needles. This subtly but eventually wears down your vinyl. Due to this I only play my mainstream vinyl that I can easily replace for $25 tops. I do not play my older vinyls that I've collected over years from peddlers malls for great prices because I know it'll be far more for me to replace them for the great deals I got. Eventually I want to save up and get a nicer setup and have great audio because I love music and I love the original smooth vinyl sound. ***BUT I have to say if you're only going to be \"collecting\" new vinyl and playing it just for the nogalistic feel then I don't think there would be anything wrong with this turntable for you.",

Overall the record player don't work and being small also affects it.Yes it may be cheap,yes it may be cute and yes it's portable.But to everyone who may argue I'm going to say that YOU DESERVE BETTER.There are tons of record players out there try searching one in between 70-90 dlls and make sure they are good quality.",

But it is definitely not perfect. The speakers are weak and will blow out easily. I definitely recommend using external speakers with this player. The arm is also very light. Even some of my 180gram vinyls have a hard time playing on it. Luckily I have more serious record players, but if this is your only one be aware that some of the newer vinyls will still have trouble. I do love the record player it's self though. I love the design and color. I find it very girly for a girly girl like me. I also like to take it on road trips, and the briefcase style makes it much easier to carry around. I also think that it's design is just enough to brighten up a room and would be very good for kids. Also another thing to know is that there is no preamp in the turntable. It's apart of the Crosley design to keep the turntable light and at low cost. So when using the headphone jack you will need an amplifier or power headphones to get quality sound. Something to keep in mind if interested in buying this record player. So overall I do like this record player and recommend it to the not so serious and beginner collectors. Just remember the light arm and speaker quality is only so-so. But a good pair of computer speakers can fix that right up.",

I use it in the shower and even tested it in a bowl of water, and it still works totally fine. The clip is very useful for when I want to clip it to one of my drawers while I'm doing chores. I've also used it on walks where I clip it to my key chain around my neck. The only con I can say is that of course for it's size, you're not getting thumpy or heavy bass, so if you're a bass head, then this speaker might not be for you. On the flip side, the sound quality is clear and crisp, with no distortion as high volumes. I also bought a case for the speaker to keep it protected. The speaker also comes with an auxiliary cable wrapped around it if you want to use it for older mp3 players. Overall, I'd say JBL knows what they're doing when it comes to sound quality.

The speaker is loud enough for a small room, but wouldn't fill up a large room. The speaker is definitely beautiful and the clip is nice and sturdy. The material it is made out of feels nice to the touch and seems to be high quality. One thing to note, this may be different than some Bluetooth headphones you may be used to regarding the built-in audio cord/cable. The Sony Bluetooth headphones I have are not required to be turned on or connected via Bluetooth to anything if I have an audio cable plugged in to them directly. That is not the case with this speaker though. Even if I have the speaker connected via the audio cable to an MP3 player, it must be turned on and it will automatically pair/connect with your phone. This can be annoying if you are using a separate MP3 player and a phone call comes in to your phone which was previously paired to the speaker. Not a deal breaker, but something to make note of.",

While it does lack some bass, I fully expected it to, considering the size of the package, but for an average music-listener it's not too much of a loss. The mids and highs are vibrant; I love watching videos on my phone while connected to this speaker. My main reason for my purchase of this little guy, however, came down to practicality. I'm a fairly clumsy person, so I wanted something that could withstand the elements and a handful of falls. This speaker is perfect for that: it's truly waterproof, so I don't have to worry about it getting wet in the Seattle rain or the shower, and it's rugged as hell. I have yet to drop it, but I have confidence that it'll survive any drops from a reasonable height. The carabiner clip and the built-in aux cord make this speaker all the more convenient! I may have to buy a second just to mess with the daisy chaining capabilities. A very worthwhile product!",

Beyond the convenient Bluetooth connectivity, it also has an (out) aux sound chord for plugging into other none-Bluetooth capable devices such as older iPods.

Personally I make a lot of smoothies with items such as yogurt and protein powder added in. The trouble is it has this very long three bladed pillar that extends almost all the way to the lid from the bottom. If you are trying to add in a powder or something like yogurt, it catches on all the blades, which means that unless you planned to fill the blender all the way to the top, that stuff won't make it into your smoothie and will instead stick and you have to scrape it in and blend again. Also it's ridiculously powerful even on the low setting, which again isn't good if you only want to make less than maximum capacity, since it splatters everywhere and you either lose a lot, or have to sit there and scrape it all out with a spatula. Overall it's just a lot of trouble unless you are using it to full capacity every time.",

I make smoothies and blend cauliflower for mash sometimes, but the primary reason for purchase was to make bulletproof coffee every morning. Upon first use for BP coffee it produced froth like I have never had and it was truly delicious. The reason I landed on this blender is because after doing research for the best blender specifically for BP coffee this was recommended if you are not willing to splurge for a Vitamix or Blendtec. At this point, I may have to do that, because even this blender has already cracked and is leaking after less than a month's use. Luckily I am still in the return frame for Amazon so they are sending me a new one (I also purchased warranty). Upon doing more research, people say in order to keep blenders from cracking when making BP coffee, you must release the air pressure out of the blender by taking off the top after no more than blending for 10 seconds. Then you can put the top back on and blend for additional time if needed. I am going to try this method, and hopefully it will keep it from cracking.",

                "review_text": "We've been battling our blender's ability to crush ice for years. Since our kiddos are huge smoothie fans and we enjoy frozen drinks, we needed a blender that could get the job done without leaving chunks of ice and a metallic smell in the air. After reading the stellar reviews and watching the impressive ice-crushing infomercial, we decided to invest in a Ninja. When this particular model had a flash sale ($53.49), we pulled the trigger. Pros: 1) It crushes ice and frozen fruit like a powerhouse, leaving no chunks behind. 2) The blade design is brilliant. Easy to insert and remove with one fluid movement. (Just don't forget to put blade in before blending!) 3) Blade removal makes pouring, scraping, and cleaning easy. (Be careful, it's sharp.) 4) Secured top system locks out leaks and splashes. 5) Flip spout allows small food items and liquid to be added while blending. 6) Has the ability to pulse or run blender hands free. 7) Holds a TON of liquid. Great for lots of people. Cons: 1) If not full, dry items (spinach) will jump to the top and stick to the sides requiring stopping and stirring manually. 2) Does not pair with individual blending cups as recommended by Amazon. 3) Cord is too short. Difficult to accommodate to outlet. Given the $54 price tag, this blender is well worth the money when entertaining and blending for groups. It gets the job done quickly and efficiently and crushes ice like magic. Cleanup is easy - simply rinse the extremely sharp blade and air dry on counter and throw the pitcher in the dishwasher. Because of the excellent top-lock feature and no openings on pitcher base, little to no residue gets on the base. I love this blender, but if I had it to do all over again, I would bypass this model and order an all-in-one Ninja blender that has the option of using smaller cups for individual drinks. Our smoothie blending would take much less time if the area inside the pitcher/cup was filled with more food/liquid so that sides didn't need to be scraped of spinach. Plus, we'd have the added individual smoothie cups for our two children, allowing them to choose the ingredients inside. While they're battling over smoothie choices, my husband and I could enjoy blending frozen margaritas in a bigger pitcher. Amazon - please stop pairing it with the \"Tritan Nutri Ninja cups.\" They're not compatible with this unit. Bottom line: Ninja packs a punch I've never seen with other blenders. It's my new brand of choice.",

                "review_text": "First of all, this is my first blender that was manufactured later than the 70s (thanks Mom for the hand-me-down Osterizer)! I am a product of the 80s, so yeah. Obviously, much improved. I've been excited to get up this past week to make my coffee smoothies before work! It is loud, I hope that my neighbor doesn't hear it downstairs, but I don't know if there is such thing as a blender that can quietly chop up ice. One of my cats watches me prep my smoothie but runs when I turn it on, and the other cat runs over to see what is making that noise, so it's tolerable for a non-fraidy cat. I've read reviews of complaints that the blade doesn't snap in and people have cut their hands, so I was nervous about that. But I sat down and read the instruction manual all the way through and it states it a bunch of times that the blade doesn't snap in and to lift it out before you pour with the lid off, so I've paid very close attention to that! Always be sure to read instructions! Reviews have complained that the blender somehow broke within weeks of purchasing it. If you read the instructions, you'll see to register it within 10 days and they have a one year warranty. I highly recommend this blender and it's super affordable! My Mom said her Vitamix heats up whatever she puts in it, so I was worried my smoothie might come out warm, but it stays cold. Maybe it's a better blender for 1/4 of the cost? Pro-tip (from Mom): After using, fill the blender with warm water a little bit away from the top with a tiny amount of dish soap and run on high and it washes out the pitcher. :)",

Blends so quickly and thoroughly! Can add in all the ingredients at once without worry of clogging or anything. I use it at low speed always because even at that setting it gets the job done quick. Now, I\u2019m certain some of you are now anxious about the horror stories you\u2019re seeing on the reviews of cut fingers and toes. I was, too...but my mom bought this for me and swore by it because she has one. I\u2019m starting to think the injuries are MAINLY user error. Don\u2019t try hand washing these blades, first of all. You will likely cut yourself due to slippery metal. I wash mine by adding hot water, soap and blending it a few times. Never had an issue with residue. Granted, I don\u2019t have a dish washer so if you do, use that. Now, as for the blades popping out, yes they can easily do that. But only if you\u2019re tipping the blender upside down without the lid on, or properly locked on. If you have to pour your smoothie or whatever out, there\u2019s a specific opening in the lid for you to do this safely! Don\u2019t remove the entire lid and pour! This will definitely make the blade pop out.",

                "review_text": "This is the best blender I have ever had, by far. I think it may be better than the $300 juicing machines. The secret is the multi-tiered blades. The top blade is almost at the top. No matter what you put in, it grabs it and grinds it up; frozen, leafy, hard, soft, whatever. You never have to push the load down. This blender makes perfect smoothies out of frozen fruit without any extra fiddling. Leafy stuff like kale can be added in at the top and it just sucks it down and grinds up. Amazing! It has lots of power. It does not slow down on a full load of frozen fruit. Even though the container is plastic, it seems very strong. I have had my blender over 1 year, and the container is in perfect condition; no cracks or scratches. When it does frozen fruit, it makes a loud noise like rocks are being thrown around inside, but then it quiets down after everything is ground into smaller pieces. The best smoothy maker ever!",

I can't speak of how it would work otherwise, but I am happy with it so far.

If you pulsed it a few times and then run it long enough for liquify it does a good job for smoothies and ice drinks. One thing people tend to underestimate is the amount of time yo should run a blender for smooth drinks which we were taught in bartending school was usually 2-4 minutes but I always see people running 30 seconds and wonder why it\u2019s lumpy. Generally if ice or frozen fruits are involved you can hear when it\u2019s done.

I considered getting a new Vitamix but thought for a fraction of the cost why not try out the Ninja. So far I have been favorably impressed. It's not nearly the power of my Vitamix (1000w vs 1380w) but for what I need to do it has worked fantastically. I mainly use it for grinding up fresh coconut meat to make coconut oil and for that task so far it has worked fantastically. I like that it doesn't get air pockets like my Vitamix used to get all the time. The only thing I don't like about it is that I can't take off the top of the pitcher while it's blending like I could with my Vitamix...I liked being able to take a spatula and push the stuff sticking on the top/sides down while it's blending...now I have to turn it off to do this. Not a deal breaker for me though. Warning...there are a lot of blades and they are very very sharp...sliced my finger the first time I tried cleaning it.",

                "review_text": "I purchased the other Ninja set \"master prep pro\" a while ago. I love it, use it a lot, but decided I wanted a tall blender. Of course I picked the Ninja. First of all, look at the price and watts on this! 1,000 watts for soooo much less than the Vitamix. The newest Vitamix is 2.2 HP (1640 Watts) for over $600! Yikes. Don't get me wrong, they are a great machine, but for those of us who don't need programmable timers, hot soup and ultra silky smooth baby food, this Ninja is the best out there. This does just about everything the high priced one does. I use this for smoothies, this can take anything you give it and blend it right up. I make frozen fruit yogurts, (add the frozen fruit to fat free yogurt (I use home made almond milk yogurt). I use it for banana \"icecream\". Whip up frozen banana pieces, takes a couple seconds with this, then add peanut butter, chocolate, nuts, whatever you want. (I use Betty Lou's powdered fat free peanut butter). Of course you have to be careful handling the ultra sharp blades. I remove the blade assembly by the tip and set it inside the sink. I continue to hold just the top tip and use a bottle brush to clean the blades. I carefully set it back in the clean blender and let it air dry. It doesn't rust. I also make my own sauces and dressings. The grand kids like the \"snow cones\" this Ninja makes. I use diluted, sugar free Torani, and DaVinci coffee syrups, (brands Amazon carries). I especially like the simplicity of the buttons. Low, medium and high. Full speed and pulse. What more does anyone need? You just can't get a more powerful, quality blender than this for the price. Update: Well, it did blend the soft frozen fruit (banana, strawberries and blueberries), but I later tried mango and pineapple. Not so good. Chunks no matter how long I blended. I guess it has limitations.",

Also, this blender was shipped in it's original box, with no discreet packaging whatsoever, so the whole neighborhood (including potential thieves) knew exactly what it was as it sat on my front porch. It also means that the box I have to return it in (the original packaging) is already beat up from shipping the first time. I honestly have no idea how this blender has been so popular.

When we returned the 2nd to the same place, we just got our money back. I called Ninja to speak to someone to see if they had any suggestions, the first person said, \"Since you went thru 2 of them in such a short time, it is obvious to me that you used it wrong.\" I let her know that we did not ever put them in the dishwasher or use harsh soap, etc. It was supposed to be able to crush ice and that is when it leaked the most. She suggested that we purchase another one and also the 200 dollar warranty that is good for 90 days. We only paid 80 dollars for it and the warranty does not cover mailing the product back and forth to be fixed. I tried to call back again to see if I could leave a complaint with their survey and she hung up on me. When I tried to call back, they had blocked my number. Because I am bilingual, I called again and chose the Spanish line. This gentleman only offered me to create an account with them so I could receive emails for promotions. I asked if I could leave a complaint and he said there wasn't any way to do that. I went on their website and there wasn't away to leave a complaint. My only other option was to leave one here on Amazon so other people will know that they don't stand behind their products. Very sad these days that no one seems to care about the consumer; only how to make more money from you. My next step is to write a letter by snail-mail since their website does not allow you to leave comments.",

Of all the (many many) things I could be doing right now, I chose to write this review, because I HATE THIS BLENDER so much. Let's count the ways, shall we? 1) The blade and blade holder is huge and does not allow larger chunks of fruit or vegetables to be placed inside the container. 2) The blades are all placed on the side, and none in the center bottom of the blade holder, meaning there is no centrifugal force, meaning that the blades scatter the components of your smoothie all over the container, instead of towards the center bottom of the container. This means that you cannot open the lid to add more liquid or fruit as it is blending. 3) The blades are not locked into place and fall out when you pour 4) It is unnecessarily loud, heavy, and clunky. 5) It does not blend properly. It is about as effective as a mortar and pestle. So in the spirit of fairness, I gave this thing two stars as it does sort of blend things and if you want to use it to make fruit smoothies, I suppose it does the job. However, if you want to make any creamy soups, vegetable smoothies, or sauces you are better off with a regular $30 Oster. My cheap blender does a more thorough job and gets less dirty. I finally thought I was rid of this nightmare when it (after only a year, with maybe bi weekly use) it crapped out on me. The manufacturer offered to send me a new motor, but I was to pay the $30 shipping. Thanks but no thanks. Verdict: Not even as good as a cheap blender. Does kind of blend.",

I thought to myself, \"I've been using food processors and other kitchen tools that have sharp, removable blades for years with no problems....\" Well, I have managed to avoid any injuries, however I have more sympathy for those people than I did before for the following two reasons: 1) the three tiers of blades mean that there is no safe way to dry this without blades sticking up in the air (unlike a knife or a food processor blade where you can lay it flat). Standing it upright the way it sits in the carafe will make it prone to tipping over. 2) the top part where you must hold the blade is small, tapered, and difficult to grip firmly with wet hands. My other complaint is that because of the three-tiered blade assembly, it is impossible to safely push things down into the blender. I make smoothies five days a week and the kale that I used to just press down to the bottom so that other ingredients would fit, I now have to blend for a moment to make room. Not a huge chore, but it slows me down. I don't love the locking lid and I fear the plastic moving parts will break before the blender wears out, but I've been using this several days a week for five months and that's still working fine. Bottom line, it blends reliably, I'm not going to replace it, but I wouldn't buy it again.",

In the meantime, this piece of fitness equipment is easy to build, install, and use making regular practice an attainable goal. It\u2019s also a great price. Word of advice: Make sure the top frame of your door (also called casing, lentil or header) is not more than 3.5\u201d tall or this unit will not fit. If you have decorative molding or a cornice on top of the frame (see pic), it will not fit no matter the size (the molding will prevent a strong purchase between the wall and the bar.) Our vintage home has these types of moldings throughout except in the renovated third floor space with 2.5\u201d door frames with doors. With or without the metal clip, you can remove the bar to close the door as well as to use the unit for floor exercises like pushups. We bought a folding step stool so that our tween son can reach the bar without jumping up. That kind of motion will definitely dislodge the unit leading to injury. The bar is listed for up to 300 pounds. Our individual weights are half of that, but I do not allow the boys to use this without an adult spotter. If you use this bar with care and caution - especially when used by kids - this pull-up bar may be a good addition to your in-home gym.",

This is where it all goes downhill. Even though the bolts had a square notch that seats into the plastic bar, it is weak and will not hold the bolt when you begin to tighten it. So basically....it just keeps spinning and eventually rounds the plastic hole. Needles to say, I was pretty disappointed and I have ordered a different brand that will hopefully be more robust than this bar. Half a star for trying, but this is going back.",

It should also specify that it will not safely fit doorways greater than a certain thickness. Every doorway in my house, including the molding thickness, is 8 inches thick. At this thickness and with my molding width, the plastic bar barely squeezes onto the molding and hangs halfway off.

I needed something to put in my door way so that I could use an autistic swing for my kids, as well as other things for my ADHD child to climb up. So I got this and since the bars are a little to wide for swings to be attached to it. So I used Ankle Straps for Cable Machines that had 2 metal hoops on it to make the swing be able to hook to the pull up bar. We also use a child's climb rope which nicely hangs their as well and has never budged from the area where it rests on. It was easy to put together, and since the weight limit is 300 I feel 100% safe that my kids and their toys that are on there will not come down. It is very sturdy and I am not going to lie at first I put all my weight on while it was on the doorway there just to make sure the molding wasn't going to come down (just because I am paranoid about things like that when evolving kids) and it has never budged once, I weigh about 200 pounds. So over all great for our needs!",

I only drink spring water and have drank from the filter and liked it- it had no after taste or plastic taste anymore. I did have some air bubbles following the filter change but it does go away after a little while. I made sure to run the water before the first use (as directed) although I didn't measure the water so was it exactly however many gallons??? No idea!

The old EveryDrop one still had 2% of use on it according to our fridge, but we replaced it with this new one and the water immediately tasted weird. I went on Amazon to see if I could get a free replacement but I'd have to return the old one. That is not easy to do. It's wet, it's been used and is still being used until we can replace it.

Each one would fit fine but I could not get any pressure at all, just a hammering sound. This official Whirlpool filter worked right away, producing better water flow than I have gotten with any of the other filter manufacturers. I didn't notice any difference in the taste of the water. The filter was troublesome after the first night and I had to adjust it a few more times before it was just right to keep the water flowing. No problems in the month since.

They spend a lot of time on the computer and I'm afraid of the cumulative damage of computer use, TV watching, tablet use, and whatever other blue-light producing products they engage in. If I can cut down on some of the blue-light damage, this is a cost effective and practical way to do it. It fits my 9-year old grandson perfectly but is a bit loose on the 5-year old (who still uses it because it looks cool).They have no graduation. For me, I've been using another blue-light set of glasses that has the +1.50 graduation I need for my vision on computer screens. My ophthalmologist told me it was a great idea and he highly recommended the protection. Basically, you figure the graduation you may need by ordering a level that is half your reading glasses strength. So, since my reading glasses are +3.00.I halved it and got the +1.50 which works perfectly. Does it affect colors? Yes, especially the first few minutes. After that, you forget they're there. If you use your computer for processing photos or designing graphics etc, you might need to, occasionally, lift the glasses up to make sure you're not over-yellowing. But for video watching, computer games, and office documents (Word, Excel, etc) it really doesn't interfere.",

They do slide down off my face a bit but, I guess I could place a shim on the bottom of the lenses where it touches my face to help keep them up...or use some sort of tie to fasten it to my head. I wear this 2 hours before I go to sleep. It's been only a week so, I don't notice a measurable difference. I'm still getting used to watching a movie without any blues and brushing my teeth with these googles on. After two hours, I'm glad to be able to take them off mostly because they are large and I'm just not used to them. I use a computer for hours but I would not use these to play video games or on the computer. Try blue blocking glasses that aren't as yellow. You'll still get some benefit and not blow out all the blues. I'm glad I tried this product. It was a good price and $9 is not a big investment to see if using them can help me sleep better and more sound.",

In an online, two image comparison graphic for testing the effectiveness of blue blocking lenses, both images appear identical when I'm wearing the glasses. They are very comfortable on my small, woman's head, have adjustable temples and fit very close to my face all the way around. The nose bridge on these glasses is molded into the lens and is not quite as comfortable as Smith & Wesson Magnum 3G glasses which have a silicone (?) nose piece but it does interfere less with vision. The lenses wrap around giving good side protection from blue light. These are very nice, inexpensive blue blockers.

I can wear them with minimal lighting inside the house at night and not stumble over anything. It seems as though they really do block only the blue light, leaving all the other light pretty much alone so you can still see. Yes, everything will have an orange tint, but I was able to quickly adjust to it. I feel like it actually improves contrast in some cases. Reading black text on a yellow-ish background from a computer screen is actually easier because my eyes don't strain from the uncomfortable blue light. Highly recommend.",

The reason I finally purchased this label maker is that I was replacing my breaker panel and wanted to label all of the new breakers. There is unlimited potential for labeling things and each day I think of something new to label. It's also great for pranks! One morning I labeled all of our cabinet doors and was sure to purposely place the labels in a different spot on each door this maximized my wife's annoyance and have me a great laugh as I acted like the labels were a great idea and not tacky at all!",

My review is for the DYMO LabelManager 160 Handheld Label Maker. I was looking for a basic label maker for an electronics project I\u2019m working on mainly, and anything around the house where a label would be helpful. I paid a little more than I wanted to, but I figured I would buy it, use it for my project, then sell it. It\u2019s kind of like renting a brand new device and then getting most of my money back. Anyway, it arrived quickly, I was pleased with the size and layout of the keyboard, and it was easy to begin using it. After inserting the blank roll of label tape I tried my first test label. The first label did not come out because it snagged inside label pathway. I saw it as my mistake for not threading the cartridge correctly on my first attempt. It really wasn\u2019t complicated at all, just one of those little things that happened because I had never used it before. Opening the back again I was able to quickly fix the threading problem and start creating labels. I was now able to quickly type and print labels with ease, and no more jams. I like that the current label does not automatically get deleted after it prints. Sometimes I needed the same label like \u201cOn - Off\u201d for several switches on my project board. Once the first label printed I pressed the cut icon then immediately pressed print again without having to retype. I\u2019ve found in life you can pick apart pretty much anything, but I don\u2019t feel this product is one of them. For the price I paid and the capability that it gives me I\u2019m pleased with the LM 160.",

It prints cleanly and the device is pretty intuitive, though if you're struggling you can find the manual at the Dymo website. Batteries are not included nor is the compatible ac adapter.

I bought this Dymo economy unit for occasional home use. It\u2019s great that it doesn\u2019t waste much tape. My only disappointment is that it comes with a caps lock button but no shift button. I consider myself part of the tech-savvy generation, who by default types quickly and professionally, and no Shift button is just an annoying handicap that clumsifies and slows down my label making experience. I guess that wouldn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re one of those people who always type in ALL-CAPS. Also, it seems about 10% of buyers (myself included) receive defective units where the drive motor won\u2019t turn the tape spool. Before you return it, there\u2019s a trick. If the unit sits on the shelf for years before getting sold, the motor bearings apparently seize up. All you have to do is remove the tape cartridge and unseize the motor by turning it a bit with your fingers. You will hear a mild pop sound and feel when the motor is unseized. My printer has been fine ever since.",

My only reason for not rating it a five is that a lot of the entries show only the raw or only the polished versions of the stones.

It's just easier to pick up this book, close my eyes, and \"feel\" a page that calls to me. I've been using it like a daily draw, once every few days. I've found the information Very useful, insightful, comforting, spiritual, healing, and interesting. look foward to getting book #3. As for the book size, I was initially surprised at the small size. However it is thick and sturdy, and actually perfect. I think the pictures are wonderful. The book is so stable it sits on the bookshelf without a bookend. Whoever criticized the pictures must be super picky. I guess if I Were a crystal expert and wanted super big clear detailed extraordinary pictures I could theoretically be disappointed.

The next day I was having company and I prepared a standing rib roast. It called for a cooking temp of 500 degrees for 40 minutes and then shut off the oven for two hours and don't open the door. After the two hour cook time with the oven off I pull out a gorgeous prime rib cooked perfectly and delicious. The pan however had turned a copper color and when I washed and cleaned it the stainless had flaked off the aluminum in the bottom of the pan. There was no cleaning the pan back to anything that looked like silver or clean. The rack, which got the low scores on the review, did however come through beautifully and cleaned up like brand new. For the investment, I would rather have put another few bucks on it and got one that could handle more than one roast before looking 40 years old and like it had been used over a camp fire. Since the rack will most likely be employed with each roasting, I guess the stainless flaking off the aluminum core wont hurt anything but it still sucks that you pay good money for a quality name like Cuisinart and come out with a total turd like this. Unless you are roasting a couple of Cornish hens or slow roasting at low temps, stay away from this junk. My moms 60 year old blue speckled roaster is still the best one I own.",

Obviously its not non stick so if you cook too high you can burn your food, however once we got used to them they cook great. Heat is evenly distributed and clean really nicely. Only negative, and its not really a problem with them, is that with our cooking we found we need an extra saucepan, as there is a small one, a medium, and a big pot. Would have liked another saucepan a bit larger than the medium included and maybe a very small one for sauces/ gravies, then it would have been perfect.

These are heavy enough to let you know that there really are three layers of metal -- and not just plating. I have used these a few times now. If you use them as other reviewers have suggested, you will not miss your non-stick pans. I almost did not buy these. I have had a very unhappy experience with Cuisinart's customer (Orbital Mixer) But these are pots and pans, so I figured I was not likely to have to deal with Cuisinart's customer service. Though I do not have experience with All-Clad, they seem to have a good reputation for good customer service. Plus they are made in the U.S. (A big plus IMHO) The Cuisinart cookware is made in France (not China), and cost about one third what the All Clad set costs. Bottom line: If price is a priority for you, I don't think you can go wrong with these. If not, consider the All-Clad.",

I decided now that I'm a young professional in a double income house with two kids, we needed to step it up and get some nice cookware and have more dinners at home. I have been searching high and low for a nice cookware set (bonus if it had a steamer). I considered the Calphalon 10pc Signature set, the All-Clad 7pc Tri-ply set, and this set. I read reviews from numerous sites, watch countless Youtube videos, and decided to take a gamble on the Cuisinart Multiclad set. Boy, am I glad I did! First of all, this cookware set feels even more comfortable in my petite hands. It's sturdy, has some solid weight to it, and looks beautiful. But how does it cook and clean? Just as great as you can imagine. I learned a great deal on how to cook using stainless steel prior to getting this cookware set and I used my knowledge to the test and the food came out wonderfully. The finish is really beautiful. I hope it continues to look as beautiful as the years go by with proper wash and care. If you are on the fence about this cookware set, I say get it. It's a great cookware for a phenomenal price. And it is much more comfortable than the All-Clad cookware. I'm 4'11 and 120lbs so I'm not that big of a person. I felt the handle on the All-Clad seemed much longer.",

I have never exceeded the middle setting on my burners and I never put cold water on a pan without allowing it to gradually air cool. After the first pan was so warped after two cooking session that I had to rock it back and forth on the stovetop for it to heat both hemispheres, I ordered a replacement and specifically laid out the replacement on my stovetop to verify that it lay flat and did not spin. I then cooked two slices of bacon, allowing the pan to preheat on medium and then reducing the heat. As soon as the heat got up to medium temperatures, the pan spun easily and rocked back and forth on the stovetop. After allowing it to cool and cleaning it with warm water, it is now permanently unstable on a flat surface. So even armed with the knowledge that warping is a potential issue and carefully adhering to Cuisinart\u2019s suggestions to avoid said warping, I am still left with an unstable $60 pan. Avoid this product if you have an electric range.",

A month or so later she informed me that it wobbled enough on her new induction stove that it was virtually useless. There was a minor dimple at the center of the bottom. That was enough of a convex surface to prevent the necessary total contact with the stove. I used SoftScrub and paper towel to clean it (and its gloss was even greater than when new), returned it for a replacement, delivered the replacement to my daughter, and a week later she called to report the same problem. I cleaned the second skillet, returned same to the local retailer, and purchased a more expensive, German skillet that is also clad and, most importantly for use on an induction stove, has an absolutely flat disc on the bottom. It works perfectly and my daughter smiles. Obvious lesson; unexcelled for both quality and price, but only for use on an electric or gas stove.",

But I like to prepare my own meals because I'll rather take charge of my own nutritional health than face the consequences of eating mystery food. I lie: I hated cooking. So, during this awful co-dependent relationship with my kitchen, my pots and pans began to die one by one (they were horrible to began with). The smartest decision I made was to research about decent stainless steel equipment and deciding on these. I enjoy cooking now. It's not something I'll ever be passionate about, but I can live with cooking everyday as long as I have these pots and pans. They look sleek, neat, and reliable--and they are. The food cooks as it should. Great even heat distribution, so no unevenly cooked dishes. Half the oatmeal doesn't stick to the sides. I've even successfully cooked rice on the stove with these pots. Cleaning is extremely easy. Fried eggs don't need to be dosed in oil and painfully scrapped off at the end of the day. And if anything sticks too hard, simply boil some vinegar and scrub lightly. And the rims are beautiful for pouring liquids out of. Form, function, and price point are all excellent. This is what I call quality engineering.",

If you have issues with sticking be sure to let the pan heat up before adding any oil or food to it, but don't have the heat too high because a: you will burn your food and b: it will stick. Cleaning has really been a cinch. After cooking in it, let the pan cool down a bit, put some hot water and deglaze the bottom of the pan. I like to just use the utensil i cooked with (not metal) and scrape around the bottom of the pan with the water in it. Within seconds the bottom of the pan is clean of food and the pan just needs to be scrubbed and put away. I do not have a dishwasher so I wash all of these by hand and the people complaining about difficulty cleaning these are ridiculous. In terms of residue on the bottom of the pans that won't come off with soap and water - these are stainless steel. That happens from time to time. I have a stainless steel work top that also gets the same type of residue. It is easy to get off with some vinegar and baking soda, or bartenders friend.",

I haven't had any issues with food sticking, which pleases me because my last set of pots and pans had the non-stick coating which wore off.

This requires high heat and this single use caused the bottom of the pan to warp, which has led to very uneven cooking on our glass cooktop, since only the one side (center of pan over to the handle) actually touches the heating element. I really want to like this pan. It feels heavy. It cleans nicely. It is a great size. I love that the lid that came with the deep saute can be used on this pan as well.

I have them in 1-1/2 qt to 4 qt saucepans with lids, and a covered 3-1/2 quart casserole. They heat evenly and are thick enough to retain their heat. There are certain instances where they benefit from soaking before cleaning, but all in all, they clean up very well. Are they as good as top quality All-Clad? No, of course not, but then again, they\u2019re a fraction of the cost. I\u2019m 68 and my days of elaborate cooking and entertaining are so few and far between it\u2019s hard to justify spending $1,000. on a set of cookware. A few years ago I started buying the MultiClad Pro to replace my decades old, deteriorated pieces of Le Creuset. I\u2019ve liked them enough that I also recently bought them when I needed pots and pans for a second home.",

                "review_text": "I cook for a larger crowd regularly, and I had come to the point of needing a few extra pieces to complement my All-Clad d5 set. However, I was not prepared to pay All-Clad prices a second time round... so I decided to go for this set, which was less for the set than the All-Clad stockpot alone. To be honest, I only realized that there was a 7 piece set after receiving this one, and maybe that was lucky, as I would have ordered the smaller set had I seen it before... but now I am happy to have the 12 set. So, comparing the two sets... - Yes, the All-Clad is better quality. Sturdier, heavier, easier to clean. But, the difference is small, and at this stage, I am not sure it's $600 better. - Once you learn how to cook with stainless steel, both sets perform beautifully. For everyday cooking, I am not seeing much difference between the two. - The Cuisinart one still cleans nicely, even though it might take a bit more soaking for burned-on food. It reacts very nicely to Bar Keeper's friend for more difficult stains. - The shiny inside surface makes me nervous for scratches, but no evidence of such yet. I am sure they will eventually appear, but, honestly, I don't care as much. - The lids are much lighter than the All-Clad ones. Not sure that it matters though. - Compared to my other set, this one seems to have less surface and more height, making it more appropriate if I am cooking smaller quantities - I find myself reaching for it if I am cooking for 1 or 2 people. - It's beautiful. Happy to see it hanging on my rack. The different sizes are the main reason I am happy I ended up buying the 12 piece set, as it gives me more flexibility in choosing the appropriate size for the job at hand. I would think that the Cuisinart version is possibly better than the All-Clad if you are routinely cooking for 1-2 people; the All-Clad may be better if cooking for 3-4. Not that either set couldn't handle any amount of people in that range. For myself, I see that I am reaching for what I thought was going to be my backup set more often than I thought I would. And, even though I can tell the All-Clad is better quality, the difference is not such that would impact my day-to-day cooking. Of course, longevity (my All-Clad set is close to 10 years old with no signs of wear) remains to be seen.",

I have been using it at least once a week and it cooks well and cleans up nicely - I let the pan cool, soak it, and haven't had to use Bon Ami too often to remove more stuck-on food. The multiclad construction allows the skillet to heat evenly and the food cooks evenly. The only issue I've encountered is due to the unevenness of the burners on my electric stove. I have to move the skillet around a bit on the cooking surface which tilts significantly, which is, of course, the fault of the stove top, not the skillet. There has been a marked improvement in the meals I've prepared using this skillet over the older, not terribly good pans it's replaced. The long handle is angled well, stays cool for handling, and makes it comfortable to maneuver the skillet during cooking and serving. The helper handle is a great and necessary addition for lifting and moving the pan. The lid is designed well and fits well. I'm pleased with the size, features, maintenance and functionality of this pan. Good price, good product. It's a joy to cook with it.",

So, I have been using this product since March 2016 (that would be just about 2 years). I have a thyroid condition which I think is somewhat responsible for my hair thinning. I'm 52, so I'm also expecting to get some thinning just due to age, but I had started to see more hair loss that I liked. My thick ponytails were getting quite thin. I did some research and found this product. I have been taking it faithfully twice per day for the past two years. it took some time for me to see a difference but now I can honestly say that my hair feels much thicker than it has in years. Its still not quite as thick as when I was 20 years old, but there is absolutely no sign of thinning spots and it looks and feels very full when I touch it. I'm also noticing a lot of new hair growth, many little hairs growing all over my head. I noticed this more because almost at the same time I started taking this product I decided to grow out my bangs. Now that they are all gone I am noticing how many little hairs are wanting to replace my bags. Its actually very exciting to see all this growth. If you want immediate results then maybe this is not the product for you, but if you have a little time then go ahead and try it. I am happy that I did and I will continue to use it .",

It\u2019s not fake it\u2019s quite real because I have used it for 6 or 7 years! I\u2019ve been a licensed cosmetologist for many years and still practicing in Wash, DC. Here is what I can tell you from experience. I found the directions not to be quite as straight forward as they should be. You have to follow the directions as stated from the beginning. Then decrease to one a day. And then continue forever. I have introduced it to a good number of clients. There are 2 is hasn\u2019t worked for. One client was determined and all of a sudden after 2 years a significant amount of hair popped out around the hairline. So it works you have to decide how much time your willing to invest. From what I\u2019ve seen give it at least a year. I myself stopped after some months and then realized it was working and went back on it. My clients have done the same. And it continues to work as long as you take it. I actually just use it a couple days per week now and won\u2019t stop. Even my co workers see the difference in my hair and refer their clients to it. You could spend your money on worse things bedsides getting better hair! Give it a try!",

I've been through it all: steroid injections, creams, acupuncture, etc. - nothing really worked for me. My acupuncturist suggested taking Viviscal in conjunction with treatment from my dermatologist (I'm doing laser treatment with an excimer machine). After 1 month, I started growing some spots of hair. It's been over 6 months now and my eyebrows have grown back, my eyelashes are no longer falling out, and the hair on my scalp is starting to fill back in. I do believe it was a combination of the laser and the viviscal. The Viviscal kept my hair strong and expedited the growth process, while the laser targeted the antibodies from attacking the hair follicle. If you're just noticing some spots, I HIGHLY recommend this product. CON: Increased unwanted hair on chin and upper lip.",

I thought at first it was due to stress from having the flu and missing some days at work. Two weeks in, even my husband commented that I was shedding more all over the house even after getting better. I thought it might be my body just getting used to these. I researched and found some women saying it affected them the same but it got better, so I continued the packet of pills. Three weeks in my hair was more brittle, dry and the ends were splitting. I went for a hair cut and my stylist commented on the change within a few months. I have been trying to grow my hair for the last year and been religiously taking care of it.
