The paint wears down quickly and make the hands look darker and more dirty, although it makes the veins on the back look more real. I received 7 right hands and 3 left hands. I don't know if the description was changed from when I ordered, but the current description says only right hands. It would be nice to have an equal number of left and right hands. I like having the thumbs match my thumbs. We take these everywhere and either get excitement and smiles out of people or get awkward and creeped out looks. I love the details with the veins and fingerprints though. They are a little tight on my fingers, but I think most people won't have this issue.",

Considering these ARE rubber hands, they do get dirty quite easily and will require cleaning with soap. Color does not rub off! Still a funny gag toy! (The hands are really detailed by the way) In conclusion: BUY AT YOUR RISK: - because they might come in uneven numbers of right and left hands - the wrong hand color PROS: Hey, in the end, you still got 10 mini hands, so smile!",

I read the reviews before purchasing, which questioned the authenticity of this product, but chose to ignore it since the vendor was viviscal. BIG MISTAKE. While packaging may change, and the items with older packaging are commonly reduced in price; i do not believe this is the same product as what is sold from other vivscal retailers. First, after taking this product for 3.5 weeks, I saw no change in hair loss. Second, after taking this product for 3.5 weeks I developed a horribly dry/rashy scalp. It was unbearably dry, flaky, and itchy. I decided to stop taking viviscal. My scalp eventually recovered. believing this product not to be the real deal, I purchased it at Target for $35.00. The packing is almost exactly the same but as mentioned in a previous review, the lot numbers are different. Amazon viviscal is alpha numerical, and targets in just numerical. The pill packaging is different which could fall under the packaging my vary description. The biggest and most disturbing difference is in the pill itself. The pills from target which is a verified Viviscal retailer, are denser, a totally different color and have a grainier look to it. This made me wonder what did I buy from Amazon? The pills look and smell different despite the Supplement Facts being EXACTLY the same. I have no idea what I was ingesting believing it to be Viviscal, and I would strongly recommend that NO ONE buys this from Amazon. Target might be a little bit more but it is worth it for an authentic product that does not potentially give you an awful reaction!",

I'm not sure if I've noticed a difference but a good friend said my hair texture was less frizzy. My nails are super strong and long, however. I am confident that I'll see improvement in my hair with continued use. Update: The pills in first batch I ordered were wide and flat and made in Ireland (supposedly). I definitely have noticed a difference in my hair quality since I've been taking them. Just ordered my second box and the packaging looks like a knockoff, as well as the pills being smaller in diameter and thicker and made in the US (supposedly). I emailed Viviscal the lot numbers and expiration dates so hopefully they can confirm which batch is real. I will be returning these pills pending their response. There is a reason the price is significantly cheaper than the pills at the store. (First order is the box/pills on the right and the lot number on the bottom; second order is left/top. I think the second one is the fake.) Update #2: I checked the lot numbers and expiration dates with the company and they told me that both boxes were legit but they have two factories, which would account for the differences in the pills. However, the second box (made in the US) is giving me really bad, unrelenting acne. The first box from Ireland also caused breakouts but that subsided after a week or so whereas this time it won't stop. If I can consistently get the pills made in Ireland, I'll keep taking them cause they definitely do seem to be making some difference. If not, the acne is a dealbreaker.",

I work in a dirty, noisy, machinery-filled environment and needed a small, lightweight unit to play CD's with acceptable sound. This one is perfect. It plays excellent quality Jensen speaker sound without the amplified, artificially boosted \"super bass\" that everyone seems to want. I have very eclectic music taste from Smooth Jazz to real Jazz to Blues and Classical music. I attended Symphony performances for years so I know what Real live music sounds like not the massive, artificially amplified pounding sound at an indoor or outdoor concert. Bose produces actual real lifelike sound and surprisingly, for it's price this does pretty dam good. It's small and light and fits easily into my rollaway toolbox compartment. And if it gets ruined at work I've spent less than $50 and would just get another one. My Bose Wave radios cost $500 each and I won't even mention the cost of the Home Theater system! Not even close to a Bose very good sound for this price.",

The CD Play states it was manufactured September 2016. I bought it in November 2016. It died June 15th, 2017! This was a total life span of 9 to 10 months. I was listening the radio and the sound went off. I thought the radio station had stopped working, but it quickly became clear that it wasn't getting power. Given that it had never been dropped and it was less than a year old I called the manufacturer. The Jensen representative told me it is only a 3 month full warranty. Had I tried using batteries? After 3 months, you have to pay $20 for them to even look at it and possibly replace it or fix it. The CD player only costs $24, so this is a good deal for them. She was willing to send me a new cable in case that was the problem. I got the cable today and it wasn't the problem. The problem is the extremely poor manufacturing. No longer worried about voiding a worthless warranty I took the CD player apart and figured out why it is so cheap in cost and construction. Most of the internal parts look like they fell off of the back of a truck. They are scuffed and poorly made. Rather than weld the wires they used hot glue. (To make it easier to fix when, not if, it breaks?) I would say it was some sort of industrial \"special glue,\" but if it looks, smells, and behaves like hot glue it probably is. It even has the little strings of glue between application sights. (See pictures.) At least three locations use thin cardboard to hold the parts in place. The motherboard does have some welding, but it is some of the worst I have ever seen and isn't uniform. I am no longer amazed that it broke within 10 month of manufacture. I am shocked that it survived this long. Even sitting on my desk must have been a strain for it. I suggest you don't waste your time, desk space, or your money on this items. If you bought it and it still works, it is just a matter of time.",

Even then, sometimes it's a bit too snug (since your fingers fluctuate each day). TIP: TRY CUTTING IT IN HALF. You'll gain a little space Since my band is slightly on the thick side, the tube doesn't close all the way. The open rubber tube can get uncomfortable since it'll scratch up your other hand when washing hands or possibly scratching your face when you touch your face. If your ring is at least a whole size too big and you don't want to re-size it (either from fluctuating so much or the anticipation of gaining all that weight back), then this is a doable temporary solution.",

I don't know, maybe they will work better on thicker ring? or bigger ring band like husband's ring?!?! we will find out.",

As one reviewer already stated, if the sizer is too long it's simple enough to cut. I don't mind using these long term, but I can see how someone would probably only want to use it for a temporary fix.",

The instructions say to put the snuggy/snuggie on after you have the ring on. I found it easier to take off the ring then put on the snuggy. They hold the ring tightly. Here are the problems that I had with it. First, the ends of the tubes are sharp. The need to be filed down so they don't irritate the fingers. Second, if you use bar soap in the bath, the soap will become caked around the snuggy. Either you have to remove your ring to shower or spend a minute cleaning it after each shower. I was irritated with these issues, so I removed it. I only had a problem of my ring flying off when I was exercising, so I put it back on only then. The rest of the time I snuggled it to my key ring. Eventually it fell of that and got lost. The other tubes aren't the same size so I can't use them now.",
