                "review_text": "As an amateur astronomer, I've done a lot of research about light pollution. That led me to research about how light affects sleep. Here's the summed-up version so you don't need to read all those scientific papers I have: - Blue light is great for being awake - that's why you wake up with a blue sky (read about melanopsin and melatonin on Wikipedia) - Blue light is not good for sleep; in the 470 nanometers range, that suppresses melatonin (a key hormone for sleeping well) - Humans (and other animals) evolved to sleep in the dark - or, at the darkest, full Moonlight (just 0.1-0.3 lux of light) - Longer wavelengths of light were the only source of light at night for most of human history (fire / candles) - Tablets / phones / screens / LED's and many CFL bulbs have strong blue wavelengths that are messing with our circadian rhythms and suppressing melatonin, because they have wavelengths shorter than 530nm - 540nm So what to do in our modern world? Wear these glasses before bed. Natural melatonin production would have occurred with our ancestors starting with the onset of sunset. Wavelengths of light from the setting sun would have shifted to red, and fire or candles were usually the only form of light available. Those are both relatively dim, and in longer wavelengths. Today, our \"connected\" world has a LOT of blue light. It's messing with our sleep patterns, because our bodies evolved to only see red/orange/yellow light at night, NOT blue light/shorter wavelenghts. THESE GLASSES BLOCK THOSE MELATONIN SUPPRESSING WAVELENGTHS. Put them on a couple hours before bed. For me, I start getting drowsy about 90 minutes after wearing them. The trick is DO NOT take them off without closing your eyes or being in a dark room (a room with ONLY a dim red light would work too, as your melanopsin won't trigger melatonin suppression with red light). So when changing for bed, close your eyes when removing your shirt if you have to pull it off over your head or put your night time clothing on. Then leave these on until you turn out the light for sleep. And be sure to sleep in the dark too, or wear a sleep mask. Small amounts of light can still affect your melatonin (well, anything brighter then full Moonlight - yes, even a blue LED on your computer). You can watch TV with these on, check your phone, read your tablet, work on your laptop - just note that colors will look weird. Blue looks black. Yellow looks white. Greens look weird. And the glasses aren't exactly stylish. But if you sleep better, who cares? They work. And while you're at it, make sure your home's lights (and business if you own one) aren't shining into other people's homes or apartments. Too much light at night is what makes these things necessary in the first place. We don't need all this light at night; these glasses are just a band aid to help; what we really need is smarter outdoor lighting - aimed down, at the ground, at the proper color(s) so we aren't suppressing others melatonin. According to a Harvard study, the U.S. loses $63 BILLION dollars per year due to American's insomnia. Artificial light at night messing up people's sleep is undoubtedly part of that - let's fix that so these glasses aren't as necessary. Oh, and did these glasses work for me? An emphatic YES, they did. 5 nights (so far) of excellent sleep and well-rested mornings. And I am NOT a morning person! They work - just use them the right way, and be sure you're not doing other things that might hurt sleep (too much caffeine, lack of / too much exercise right before bed, sleep apnea, etc.) So if it's not a medical condition, do the right things, wear these, and get better sleep.",

                "review_text": "I can sleep at last! These orange Uvex Skyper glasses worn every evening - in combination with the Luminette Bright Light Theraply Glasses worn every morning - have totally transformed my life! Prior to buying these two items my sleep cycle had been appallingly since uni days. Years of working on a laptop all night in a brightly lit office had ruined my body's ability to regulate its sleep. I'd be bursting with energy at midnight, and then still powering away at dawn. It was easy to stay awake for 36 hours at time, but almost impossible to sleep. Mornings were just awful, and I'd feel lacklustre all day ... until about 7pm when my energy levels would begin to rise again. Over the years I had often tried to reform my sleep, but without any success; clearly, my brain was simply not producing melatonin. A few months ago I decided to start an experiment to see if cutting out blue light at night, and then adding bright blue light in the mornings, could overcome the chronic sleep problems. The science seemed valid, so I hoped it would work on me. I bought both the Uvex Skyper orange glasses (to block blue light in the evenings) and the Luminette glasses (to simulate bright daylight in the mornings) and used both diligently every day as part of a program to reform my sleep. Here's what I experienced. 1. Within a couple of weeks of wearing the Uvex Skyper glasses I started getting sleepy at around 11pm, like normal people do!! 2. After just a few mornings of wearing the Luminette glasses I began to enjoy waking up. I couldn't wait to pop on my \"happy glasses\" as they made me feel wonderful! Now, more than 2 months later, I wake every morning around 7am feeling bright and cheerful. 3. The quality of my sleep has been completely transformed. Only three months ago I would wake every half hour and then lie awake for another two or three hours; now I sleep soundly the whole night through! Based upon my experience, here are the key conclusions I'd to share with others. * If an inability to wind down or fall asleep is your main problem, then the orange Uvex Skyper glasses (around $9) should be your first purchase - because if you can kick-start your melatonin production at night, then you will sleep better and wake happier. * However, if you struggle to wake up and you feel sluggish for hours afterwards, then the Luminette glasses could be transformational for you (as they were for me). I used to hate mornings ... and now I love them! * You still need to be sufficiently self disciplined to use the specs diligently. E.g. if I forget to wear the orange glasses for a few nights, then my old habit of staying awake all night quickly returns. I'm writing this review jointly for the Uvex Skyper Blue Light Blocking Glasses (for evenings) and the Luminette 2 SAD Bright Light Therapy Glasses (for mornings) because I used both over the same time period and it isn't really possible to tell which of them has contributed most to resolving my sleep and wake problems.",

First, after taking this product for 3.5 weeks, I saw no change in hair loss. Second, after taking this product for 3.5 weeks I developed a horribly dry/rashy scalp. It was unbearably dry, flaky, and itchy. I decided to stop taking viviscal. My scalp eventually recovered. believing this product not to be the real deal, I purchased it at Target for $35.00. The packing is almost exactly the same but as mentioned in a previous review, the lot numbers are different. Amazon viviscal is alpha numerical, and targets in just numerical. The pill packaging is different which could fall under the packaging my vary description. The biggest and most disturbing difference is in the pill itself. The pills from target which is a verified Viviscal retailer, are denser, a totally different color and have a grainier look to it. This made me wonder what did I buy from Amazon? The pills look and smell different despite the Supplement Facts being EXACTLY the same. I have no idea what I was ingesting believing it to be Viviscal, and I would strongly recommend that NO ONE buys this from Amazon. Target might be a little bit more but it is worth it for an authentic product that does not potentially give you an awful reaction!",

                "review_text": "It's been about 20 days and I've only been taking one a day (at night) because the tablets were causing my skin to break out a lot. I'm not sure if I've noticed a difference but a good friend said my hair texture was less frizzy. My nails are super strong and long, however. I am confident that I'll see improvement in my hair with continued use. Update: The pills in first batch I ordered were wide and flat and made in Ireland (supposedly). I definitely have noticed a difference in my hair quality since I've been taking them. Just ordered my second box and the packaging looks like a knockoff, as well as the pills being smaller in diameter and thicker and made in the US (supposedly). I emailed Viviscal the lot numbers and expiration dates so hopefully they can confirm which batch is real. I will be returning these pills pending their response. There is a reason the price is significantly cheaper than the pills at the store. (First order is the box/pills on the right and the lot number on the bottom; second order is left/top. I think the second one is the fake.) Update #2: I checked the lot numbers and expiration dates with the company and they told me that both boxes were legit but they have two factories, which would account for the differences in the pills. However, the second box (made in the US) is giving me really bad, unrelenting acne. The first box from Ireland also caused breakouts but that subsided after a week or so whereas this time it won't stop. If I can consistently get the pills made in Ireland, I'll keep taking them cause they definitely do seem to be making some difference. If not, the acne is a dealbreaker.",

I've also used them to get a bear's attention several times, when I wanted them to see me along salmon streams in Alaska. That usually is enough to encourage the bears to move off and let me pass. I also keep one on my boat, as a signaling device. Electric horns on boats are notorious for corroding and failing, and the Coast Guard considers these whistles as adequate, which has helped me pass boarding inspections a couple of times. For me, its just cheap insurance that I'll be able to get someone's attention if I need to, or to avoid a ticket in case the Coast Guard wants to do an inspection.

                "review_text": "We have been using the Infant Optics DXR-8 video monitor for 1 year now and felt we could now give an accurate review. If you're in a hurry, the summary of this review is that this camera and monitor are great and the customer service provided by the company is outstanding (see below). So stop hunting and trying to weigh all the baby camera/monitor reviews and get this camera and monitor if it provides you with all the features you want. You really aren't going to find anything better. We initially purchased this camera and monitor after spending way too much time pouring over all the options available to us, trying to find the BEST camera and monitor for our new baby. Our main concerns were getting a good camera with quality night imaging, good sound and an easily viewable monitor. We also felt we didn't want a system that sent our image feed off to some remote server where it would be stored for some period of time for whatever analytics that the company performed. The Infant Optics DXR-8 fulfilled all our wishes. Set-up: Setting up the monitor and camera was easy. We followed the directions and had no issues at all pairing the camera and monitor. The camera was actually very light and we hung it up on the wall so it could capture the entire inside of the crib. Again, it was very easy. USE: The monitor had a clear picture in day light and more importantly, at night. The monitors range was sufficient for us and we had no problems even after we moved baby out of our room and into her own as our rooms were on different floors. The monitor always worked great and we could always see the baby when we wanted. The controls on the monitor were easy to use and the buttons were large enough to use in the middle of the night with no light or light from monitor alone. We appreciated the simplicity, particularly when sleep deprived. In terms of battery life for the monitor, we had no issues once we figured out our schedule. We used it pretty much throughout the day unplugged and kept it plugged in overnight night by our bed, pretty much like our phones. Occasionally we ran out of battery but not frequently enough where we thought there was something wrong. It was all we could ask for. Customer Service: Now for the best part. Coming up on a year of use, the power button on the monitor began to stick. We started having issues turning the monitor on and off and putting it to sleep. It got to the point where the monitor turned on and off by itself sporadically which was problematic at night. We wrote an email to Infant Optics explaining the situation and hoping for a repair or replacement. We received a response on the very same day we wrote (Sunday!) explaining that a replacement monitor would be easiest. So we sent the monitor back through the mail and sent them a picture of the package and the receipt. Given this proof, they were able to send out our replacement before they received our broken monitor and we received the new monitor in the mail in 2 days! But that\u2019s not all. We accidentally sent back the battery for the monitor which we were instructed not to do (The monitor still works without a battery if plugged in). So we wrote again explaining our mistake. Infant Optics immediately got back to us again and sent out another battery for the monitor. 2 days later we had a new battery for our new monitor. Conclusion: Honestly, we could not ask for better treatment. This is the type of costumer service that actually makes you happy and reaffirms that the Infant Optics camera and monitor was the right choice for our family. You can\u2019t go wrong with this camera and monitor. It works great and it is backed up by outstanding customer service that provides peace of mind all new parents should be afforded.",

                "review_text": "Side-by-side comparison of the Samsung SEW-3043W and Infant Optics DXR-8: First, I just want to say that I am an actual customer that purchased both of these knowing that I would be returning one. It is our first baby together, and we wanted to make sure we had the best possible monitor. The mommy-to-be and I wanted to test both of these units side-by-side to see how they compared to each other. Samsung initially seemed like the better choice as it had the 5\u201d screen compared to the DXR-8\u2019s screen of only 3.5\u201d The Samsung also had music playback on the camera in the baby\u2019s room (4 different lullaby song choices), and a small night light on the top of the camera (which you can turn on and off). However, when it came to actually functionality, the DXR-8 was by far the BETTER choice. The on-screen touch controls of the Samsung lagged and were difficult to use. The Samsung\u2019s touch screen is far different than the touch screen on their cell phones, their touch screen has little sensors throughout that you can see if you look at it closely. The Samsung also went out of range (as noted in many of the pictures) when compared to the DXR-8. In one picture I took both units outside. The DXR-8 went over 200\u2019 from my house (and probably could have gone much further). The Samsung went out of range before I even got out the door. The Samsung unit failed at three different areas in my house. Trust me when I tell you that I didn\u2019t make the test easy either. I had three doors shut and about four walls separating the handheld units from their cameras. I took them throughout the house, side-by-side, at the same time. Save yourself both time and $$$ and just start with the Infant Optics DXR-8. Additional pros of the DXR-8 include the on-screen temperature display of the baby\u2019s room, and a brighter display (the Samsung display was rather disappointing, I thought it would have been the far better display, but it simply was not). The only con of the DXR-8 is the smaller screen size, but it is sufficient. Both units functioned about the same when it came to night vision.",
