59,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,"Fun bag, but not practical",3.0 ,"Ordered this as a ""fun"" bag as this is the Year of the Rooster 2017. It is large enough to hold a wallet, an umbrella, a pocket camera, a handphone, a fat toiletry pouch that holds all my ""girl items"". My only dislike is the length/size of the zip opening on top of the bag - it is 6 inches (15cm). To put a regular size ladies wallet or an umbrella inside the bag, I had to slip the item in sideways (not length-wise). I think it will be hard to have to maneuver an item to it's shorter side inside the bag just to take it out of the bag. And of course if you have ""big"" hands, it will be a struggle to get your hand even inside the bag. Even with my hands (XS Gloves American-Size), it was not easy for me. And the straps are not long enough to carry the bag on my shoulder.",,,09 Jan 2017

62,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,It came when we opened it was plastic and that's not completely bad it was semi waterproof,2.0 ,Well we bought my mom the chicken purse and we were so excited. It came when we opened it was plastic and that's not completely bad it was semi waterproof. But as we looked more into it and we liked it. We were going to put all of the stuff in the purse but the whole/ zipper was too small you could not put anything in it. The purse also had a really insane smell. But for women who don't like big purses with small wholes I do not recommend this for you. Even though it is really cool it looks like a pretty good chicken the only problem is that it has a lot of space you can’t put your things in there. I think it just needs to shrink in size and open the zipper more and it will be fine and pleas get rid of the smell.,,,12 Sep 2016

I wish the handles were just a little bit longer, it's tough to carry over my shoulder.

97,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,Very Unique,3.0 ,The chicken purse is made of vinyl and is not very made for anyone wanting a real purse. This bag is very large and is for some one that wants a bit of whimsy. It is cute and was bought for an elderly person who is crazy about chickens. She LOVED IT!,,,12 Dec 2013
98,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,"Love the concept, but.....",3.0 ,"I love my chickens...and I really do like the concept of this purse. It is made of rubber, and therefore would be a great purse for rainy weather. When the purse arrived, it had been folded for shipping (I can understand that), However, I have to keep it fairly loaded so it doesn't look like a folded chicken. I love carrying it and always get compliments (or at least giggles), but I have had to quit carrying it since the zipper is so short and it is a constant struggle to get my wallet in and out through the zippered opening. When I do manage to get the wallet through the top it always seems to hang on the pocket inside the purse and I have to struggle to get it past that obstacle too. I am really disappointed that the inconvenience is greater than the pleasure of carrying it since I really do like the bag. I think it would have held up well if I had been able to use it more often. But alas, I guess it was not meant to be! On the plus side, once you are able to fit your items into the bag it holds quite a bit of necessary things that women like to carry around with them. Another plus for this bag is that if you happen to be of child bearing age and also happen to have a small person you are carrying around with you...I'm sure a couple of bottles would fit in here nicely along with a diaper or two. And if a bottle happened to leak...hey, no problem. Rubber chicken will protect liquids from bleeding through and damaging anything the purse happens to be sitting on. You would have to be careful with the diaper suggestion though. I think the zipper would probably tear the plastic around the diaper.",,,25 Nov 2013
99,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,Chicken Stench-O-Rama Bag!,1.0 ,"I saw a girl at the gym with this bag and I had to have one. The zipper was really small and I could not easily put anything inside it without intricate, time-consuming maneuvering. It was a conversation starter and the kids loved it. I took it to a farm school and the real chicken there had issues with it and tried to attack it. When I first unpacked it, I was thrown off by the smell, and I hoped that in time, it would diminish. No. It didn't. It's like a dead body was dipped in petroleum and glued to a giant moth ball. The fumes are so intense it makes your nose burn and your contact lenses bend inside out. You will weep for any kind of relief. I filled the entire purse with bounce sheets and wrapped it in wax paper and stuck it in the freezer for a week to see if the smell would fade away. No such luck. All my frozen food smells like it's been shoved up the tail pipe of a big rig. I had to throw everything out. I put baby powder in it and wrapped it in bubble wrap and put it outside for a week and then poured baking soda in the purse to see if that would help. No. It didn't. Although I really loved the concept and whimsy of the purse, I finally gave up the dream and donated it to Goodwill by dumping it in an overnight depository. At this time I must apologize to the needy who will discover this petroleum treasure. I mean you no harm. But it's cute, isn't it?",,,23 Nov 2013
100,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,"Cute, hilarious, and not made for long term use. A great gag gift.",3.0 ,"This is a hen bag. It is a great gag gift, but I am sure it will fall apart given a lot of use. Its build quality is not that of a Michael Kors or Tory Burch bag, it is made of thin rubber (or vinyl or something of that ilk) barring the handles, which are rolled canvas. Where these stitch to the rubber is bound to fall apart eventually. That said, it's a hen bag!",,,17 Oct 2013
101,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,eeeew,2.0 ,"The color is wrong on the pic, the bag is more yellow-orange, and I don't like it. Smells terrible. Hole-zip is really small and it hard put your stuff easily.",,,07 Jul 2013
102,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,So disappointed!,1.0 ,"I got this along with a baby chick coin purse to give to my mother as a gift. The quality of this purse is so cheap! I can see them selling this same purse for at most $20 and that's giving it a huge mark up for its novelty value. It probably only cost them like two bucks to make it. The material is thin and due to the way it's been packaged for who knows how long, the purse is lumpy. The area around the tail is folded out at an unflattering angle and one side of the face is lower than the other, along with many other lumps and bumps. The purse deflates easily and probably would only look nice if it was kept quite full. However, since the material is so thin my mother is worried that filling it too much will make it break. The plastic rod in the handles also seem like they may come loose and fall out if you're not careful. I can't believe I paid so much for this! At least my mother was amused by the idea of the purse rather than its execution. Thankfully the coin purse I got her made her really happy as it is something she can use for a long time.",,,02 Jul 2013
103,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,Bawk Bawk Bawk Cute but not very practical.,3.0 ,"If you or a friend are chicken enthusiasts then this is a fun gift. The purse feels like a rubber chicken which I don't personally love but my friend did. The problem is that the opening on top is too small and makes it difficult to load and unload it. The matching coin purse is cute but has the same problem. I bought an egg key chain to go in the coin purse for my friend and it wouldn't fit in the opening and it is hard to get coins out of it unless you dump it over. I made a box that looked like a chicken nest and put Easter eggs in and around it and gave it to my wonderful boss for Easter. I don't know if she liked it or not. She had seen it in an expensive tourist shop in Savannah, GA and thought it was really fun so I ordered one for her.",,,26 May 2013

113,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,Super cute but not meant for me,3.0 ,"It was love at first sight for me and ""Hen-ry"" and I had to have him. I told my husband about this purse and how much I wanted to have it. My husband, knowing how much of a bag person I am, has been wanting to get me a new purse for months but between a new baby and me not finding a purse I liked had put it off until now. He ordered it the next day for me and of course, was super excited and I tried out Hen-ry for a full day the next day. Cons: I did read the reviews prior to purchasing and a few commented on the small zipper opening and I did study the picture of the opening that has been posted and let me tell you this; I completely under-estimated its size. It is really small. I couldn't appreciate how small it was until I tried to put everything I carry into Hen-ry. I tend to carry a lot of stuff with me (and as my husband will say, ""everything including the kitchen sink."") and with the small opening, it makes getting stuff in and out annoying. I use a long wallet similar to Coach F46161 Ashley Signature Sateen Wallet - Khaki/Mahogany and I was barely able to fit it inside horizontally. I also use a coupon organizer similar to C-Line Biodegradable 13-Pocket Expanding File, Coupon Size, 1 File Folder, Color May Vary (48410) and I had a similarly hard time as my wallet putting it in. There is only one small interior pocket and I was hoping to use that as my phone pocket but it didn't fit my iPhone too well. I happen to work in an office environment and thus, I carry my office keys and other work related things along with my personal stuff so having only one pocket hurts me in keeping everything organized. The bag came with a rubbery chemical smell and I knew that the bag would have some sort of a smell with the type of material its made from but it gave me a pounding headache which I didn't expect. Pros: It's an attractive bag and I received many compliments on my first day out with him. I love to make people smile and this bag does just that. The overall interior is quite roomy. If you carry a lot of little items with you or travel light, the small zipper opening shouldn't be an issue for you. With its rubbery exterior, it makes cleaning very easy. Overall: Would I recommend this bag? Yes for the most part but if your anything like me in how I carry everything with me, then no. I will be returning Hen-ry and it greatly saddens me. I really hoped we would work out but it wasn't meant to be.",,,05 Sep 2012

116,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,Rubber Chicken Henbag,3.0 ,"This is not a TOY! I bought it more as a joke than a purse. It's very cute, but smells like the rubber it is made of and the opening on top is rather small. I had read this on other reviews but thought it would still work for what I wanted it for. We have a group of mothers and daughters who travel together for a shopping trip once or twice a year as a ""bonding"" weekend. It's become known as ""Chick"" weekend.

I *had* to ask where she got it from, cuteness overload. She had worn it so hard there were holes underneath the handles. I have moments where I love having a cheap chicken purse ( I believe I purchased it for about 20 back before this purse exploded on here-- surprised they bumped it to $40... IDK if its worth that price personally), as opposed to a designer bag worth hundred of thousands of dollars-- and this purse makes people smile! This is def a novelty purse, the zipper on the top is kinda small ( the opening in general). Makes it hard to grab aroung in the bag, might be easier to have 2-3pouches in there with all your things in them. That way you could just pull a pouch out, instead of fishing in your bag with one hand.The lining inside is a pale yellow, gets dirty real fast--black would be perfect.

Yes, it's rubber so it smelled like .....rubber. The smell ( which smelled like new dolls used to smell to me when I got them as child ) was not bad at all, it has since faded. The opening is small, that is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, it's hard to get anything out of this purse. I took it out in public as soon as I got it ( even though my sister begged me not to take it ) and the compliments began right away. I have had so many compliments on this purse that I lost count long ago. Not very long into the day, my sister was holding my purse for me and even sat it on her side of the tabletop of the restaurant we lunched at. I am not really interested in carrying the same cookie cutter purse the rest of the world has and this purse has put smiles on so many faces ( yes, one or two of them have been mean ones ) that I really look forward to going places with it.

It makes me super happy every time I see it, causes spontaneous conversation, and amusement to everyone else who sees it as well. I have two complaints, first the opening is too fricking small, which is incredibly frustrating, given that it's roomy and so much more should fit in it than does. Second, it would be more aesthetically pleasing if a small amount of material/foam/whatever were in the head so that my poor chicken doesn't look so smooshed. Lastly, a previous reviewer extolled the virtues of the spacious handles, easily accommodating over the shoulder wear, even in a bulky winter cloak. If you purchased as a fat person, expecting it to fit over your arm, alas, it may not. I am still ridiculously happy with my stupid handbag, regardless.",,,08 Aug 2017

The color is more of a light cream with a tinge of yellow, not dark yellow. Has a flat bottom so it sits well. The inside is just an empty large cavern with one pocket that is open (decent for keys and chapstick). I agree with everyone else that the smell is a little strong the first moments you have it, but mine has so far died down a bit. The zipper is also a little on the short side, so if your items inside are jumbled it can be a little harder to find. When I received mine it was a tad flattened, but the purse will naturally puff out after being filled (I'd say a day before the face on mine wasn't flat). Straps are short of course, easiest to carry it on the crook of your arm or in your hand rather than on your shoulder. My straps have this tubing in it that sometimes pops out a little bit, I just push it back in. All in all, amazing purse. I have gotten so many compliments on it. I ended up changing my text noise to that of a chicken cluck just to pull the whole thing together!",,,28 Aug 2015

You will love bringing this purse with you everywhere as your buddy, and enjoying all the fun comments people will make!

I live in Brooklyn, which is ""ground zero for cool"". My neighborhood in particular, is awesome but is not the coolest (it's being invaded by investment bankers who are not cool at all). :-) I thought for sure that at least 4 or 5 women would stop me on the street asking me where I got the bag. I walked 3 blocks with my lovely rubber chicken purse without a word or glance by anyone (granted, I was holding it close to my body and my coat was the same off-white/yellowish color)...until, that is, a woman whom I suspect spied the lovely chicken, laughed out loud. Now, I couldn't tell if it was a, ""OMG, that's the BEST thing ever!"" laugh or a, ""OMG, what an incredibly ridiculous thing!"" laugh. Thinking she was a non-cool banker, I ignored that reaction and continued my walk. I got coffee (no reaction) and then went to my favorite bead/jewelry store (no reaction). Finally, I was so disappointed that my favorite jewelry store employees (and co-jewelry designers!) hadn't said a word, that I blurted, ""What do you think about my lovely rubber chicken purse?"" The reaction? ""I LOVE your chicken purse. Oh my God! That is the best!"" Not only did the employees genuinely gush about how much they LOVED my purse, but so did the customers. (Apparently, the head employee had designed animal purses at fashion school...which were shot down.) They even asked, ""Where did you get it??"" I'm looking forward to ""round 2"" next weekend. P.S.

Seriously, it's just the funniest darn thing ever and looking at it makes me smile. I also get comments...lots and lots of comments. Many, many women have asked me where I got it in the two months I've been carrying it. Some ask me to wait while they run and get a friend to look at it. I've had a lady just tentatively reach out a finger and poke it at church, without saying a word. LOL. In fact, I've also had a number of men comment on the awesomeness that is the chicken purse. Okay...Pro's: Roomy. Very roomy! You can fit a lot of stuff in this bag. It seems to be very well constructed. The materials are, obviously, easy to clean and if you squish it, it bounces right back. Finally - IT'S A FREAKING RUBBER CHICKEN PURSE! Con's: Yes, amazing chicken purse or not, there are a couple of cons. The single biggest one is the opening zipper is kind of small and because of that it's hard to find things in. You do a lot of feeling around for what you want. I wish the little pocket on the side had a zipper. It's kind of worthless without it. The handles aren't sewn shut so the rubber hose thing that makes them round tends to try to slide out; you see it right away and slide it back, but still. But in the end, I love her.

The outside is a rubbery substance but the lining and bottom is some kind of thin waterproof cloth. There is one small interior pocket to separate out some small items like a wallet or keys. Overall the bag is robust enough for everyday use. It seems to make people happy to see it and attracts many comments. The size of the zip is as shown in the picture and is big enough to accommodate a paperback book or similar sized objects. I do not find it to be a problem.,,,26 Aug 2014

At first it was a little lumpy from being in a little box, but after shoving all of my junk into it, my chicken shaped up nicely. I've had it for a month and I'm still in love with it. There is a PVC plastic smell to the bag but DUH its brand new!!! It's not overpowering or gross in any way. It doesn't stink up your stuff either. If you don't want to smell it, don't stick your face inside of your bag. The zipper is quite short but I don't have any problems putting my stuff inside. I can get DVDs, CDs, my tablet, folded clothes, and my long wallet through the zipper so absolutely NO COMPLAINTS!!! You must buy this bag!",,,12 Jul 2014

My mom is very fun and social, so when she gets in a fun and funky mood, I can definitely see her wearing this purse out about town. She laughed out load when she opened her chicken purse gift. She loves things that make her smile and giggle (who doesn't), so this was a perfect, fun gift for her. The zipper opening on top is small, as others have said, but not so small that you can't put belongings in. The purse cavern is large and can hold quite a bit, I imagine. The small opening could be annoying, but not to the point of not wearing the purse. It's still a 5 star item for sure.",,,14 May 2014
432,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,I can't go back to a regular purse! So addictive to carry!,5.0 ,This is perhaps the best purse I have ever owned! I recommend it for anyone who has a sense of humor or wants to draw a little attention while out in public. But be prepared for chuckles and people constantly asking you were you got it from. My chicken purse who I have named Ms. Nugget goes everywhere with me and I find it difficult now to go back to a regular purse. I was surprised that the purse is actually a little bit bigger then I expected. As stated before by other people the zipper is a little too small and sometimes you have to work to get things in or out. But that is the only complaint I could find with this purse. It is made of rubber but I did not notice any kind of rubber smell. Because it is made of rubber I would not put anything sharp in it. I like the fact that it is made from rubber because I have been caught in many rainstorms this spring and the rain drops just bounce right off it. The inside is made from a silky type material and it has one pocket which is handy. The red handles are comfortable and are made from some kind of sturdy wire. The purse over all is deep and can fit many things. It is also easy to wipe clean. I have to say I am very addicted to this purse and carry it where ever I go.,,,30 Apr 2014

493,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,Best. Purse. Ever.,5.0 ,"What can I say? I got this as a gift and absolutely love it. This is the *ultimate* purse! I had already read other reviews, so I was aware that the zipper compartment was small, so that didn't surprise me. It will take some getting used to, though, so if you're planning on getting this purse, be prepared for a small adjustment period as you get used to carefully guiding things through a small opening. That said, I have a very large wallet, and it fits inside. Think of it as a bonus - nobody is ever just going to reach into your purse and snatch something out. You'll *know* if they try, and they won't be able to do it quickly. Your chicken will protect your goodies. The purse can hold quite a bit. It's a fat little thing with one little side pocket inside. When I used it the other day I put this in it: - a full size wallet - some paperwork - a nail care case - an electronic cigarette case about the size of my full size wallet - lots of pens and pencils - a knife - a sewing kit - a comb and brush - some safety pins - some scissors - a 16 oz. bottle of soda - my cell phone - two small packages of candy - my keys - my medicine - a charging cord for the e-cig - women's personal products - a small credit card pouch - reading glasses in a plastic case - a roll of tape And although the little chicken was full, there was room for more. It's also water-proof, which can be quite handy where I live. The only way you could improve this thing would be to make it cluck when you squeeze the beak.",,,01 Jul 2013

Now if we could only add a ring tone of the chicken dance or something .... :) Seriously, though it is super sturdy, not heavy at all. The flat bottom is nice and the light colored interior helps to locate items inside. The only change I'd made is for the opening to be a few inches wider, but that's because I like big slouchy bags and the big openings that come with them. But the purse wasn't for me anyhow.

I crammed newspaper (supposed to absorb odors) and a scented dryer sheet. Let it sit for a few days and it seems to be tolerable. I don't carry it next to my nose so I no longer care about the smell...although I question if other can smell it as a I walk by because, Lordy, I hope they don't think that is me stinking like that LOL! :-D The perfect gift for a lover of all things chicken :-D",,,31 Jan 2013

I switched to a black satchel and it is SO BORING. People love the hen bag all around the world. I took it to London, France, and Spain...everywhere I went, people were thrilled. It really is a conversation starter and broke down cultural barriers like no amount of well-meaning language butchering could. Anywhere I go, whether it's starbucks or a dive bar, people love the chicken. I decided that since everyone was going to be so nice about it, I would get little gifts to hand out to people who found it amusing, which is why I got the Mini Chickens: [...] They sell them by the gross, and I did not foresee getting through a gross of itty bitty chickens, but people love them. Kids, adults, men, women... everyone loves them. I receive photos from all measure of situations and geographies featuring my chickens having margaritas, sunning themselves, supporting mini gnomes, etc. I think of this bag as a lifestyle. There is one seriously bad thing about this bag, which is the zipper at the top. It's so fricken small. It takes a lot of work to get anything at all out of the top. Digging for makeup is practically impossible. It's just an unfortunate function of the physiology of the rubber chicken style, but it still is a pain in the butt.

It measures about 10 inches across the bottom and about the same at the top but the top is curved. It's about 7-8 inches tall. A good medium size bag. The zipper opening is only six inches which seems ok but when you actually open it you're only getting about a 4 inch hole. But I knew that from reading reviews. I couldn't get my wallet in but it's a big wallet and that's ok because I rarely carry it anyway. I have my phone, ID case, keys, mirror, some makeup, glasses, water, and there's lots more room. I love it! Everyone loves it! My daughters were shocked! They couldn't believe I was carrying a chicken purse. It's so cheery.

He did not buy it from Amazon. However, it randomly it showed up in Amazon's Best Sellers list today. I will be reviewing the purse, not Amazon's awesome service. The purse is pretty great. It holds up well, easy to clean (rubber), and roomy. I may not have bought this for myself because of the following reasons, which are also why I gave the purse 4 stars. -I like a little smaller purse, especially with short handles. -I prefer handles I can put on my shoulder. -The opening, as mentioned in almost every other review, is small. I do enjoy carrying Billina around. She certainly turns heads! When my husband wrapped the purse for Christmas, he cleverly filled it with plastic Easter eggs. This was very fun! I use one of those eggs as a change purse! As I mentioned in a comment, I also like to set my ringtone to some sort of chicken noise. It just seems like the right thing to do.

It was indeed eye catching, but wasn't too much? I mulled it over in my head for about two weeks, until i finally decided, for 20 bucks (no pun intended)? It was worth the risk, so I went ahead and made the purchase, and I am SO glad I did! This bag is AWESOME! It is truly unique. Everywhere I take it, It catches glimpses, and compliments. This bag is DEFINITELY not for one who takes themselves too seriously. For me, it fits my personality perfectly. The only thing negative I have to say is, The zipper is a little on the short side. It makes it hard to see into the bag and reach in. Definitely not as convenient, but its novelty charm definitely makes up for it in my mind.

To my surprise it was the chicken purse!!! My sweet oldest daughter bought it for me for Mothers Day. I called to thank her, and we started picking out names for her. We settled on the name Fannie Lou, because we were sure Henny Penny had already been taken. We had the best time thinking of all the things we could do with this purse, like making a nest for her in the front seat, with fake eggs!!! We were just having fun, so this chicken purse will make you laugh. It does have a strong rubber smell to it, but who cares, it will go away a some point. The opening is 7"" wide big enough to get most things inside. Once inside it is huge, I got a lot of stuff in mine. First trip out was to the grocery store, it was priceless!!! In the milk/egg aisle, I am looking at eggs (honest) 2 little girls with their mom staring at my chicken purse, looking at me like why are you buying eggs lady? Their mom wanted to know where I got that purse, either everyone in the store were enjoying Fannie Lou or thinking, look at that crazy lady with that chicken purse. I don't care, if it makes one person smile then it is worth it.

It barely fits in the opening - it is a challenge - but then it lays perfectly on the bottom. I doubt I will use it regularly, though, as cavernous purses with no pockets irritate me. It is just a matter of time before Clucky is bloated with 6-month old receipts.

569,"rubber chicken purse - the ""hen bag"" handbag",39.99,Fun but not terribly practical,5.0 ,"Fun: Cute & good for starting conversations Impractical: Opening to purse is rather small, making it difficult to insert & remove items. Has only one interior pocket that is difficult to see into. After two weeks the burnt rubber smell is still pretty strong (especially if it is in the sun). Revised review 1 year later. Ok, I confess, I just bought my second chicken purse so I must increase my rating to 5 stars. The smell does eventually go away completely, but it took about 4-6weeks. Yes, it is impractical in all of the ways I describe above. I solved the problem of not being able to find my cell phone in this purse by attaching a Nintendo game-boy case to the handle for the purpose of keeping my phone in an easily accessible spot. The thing I love about this purse, I'm embarrassed to admit, is all of the attention it brings. I've had multiple people stop me to take pictures of my purse. I get comments almost every day when I use this purse. People recognize me by my purse now; it has become a part of my identity. Its a fun conversation starter as well.

The awesome Pros of the chicken purse: *Not highly susceptible to purse thieves (it's a bit flashy) *Nice size for carrying objects (ex. water bottles) inside *Conversation starter *Matches well with most wardrobes (surprisingly!) *Feels very durable- strong handles, nice and detailed rubber *Has a handy inside pocket for keys or cellphone *Lined with silk-like material and bottom of purse is reinforced *Fits over the forearm (even with a bulky winter coat on!) for those chilly days when hands must be in pockets The minimal Cons of the Chicken Purse: *Might attract more attention than wanted *The zipper closer IS a bit shorter than expected and can be a hassle when putting objects (like microwave-ready soup containers) inside, but for general (normal?) use it isn't too much or an issue *Has an odd rubber smell that isn't a big deal and is only noticeable when sticking your nose in the bag. (and will eventually fade, I think). So far, it hasn't made any items inside the bag smell, but when I added a pack of minty gum inside, the two smells mixed and are fairly unlikable. *Feels durable, but I am concerned about sharp objects possibly stabbing through the rubber (somehow??) Overall, I am thrilled I received this as a birthday present. I did have it on my wish list. A great gift idea for someone who loves chickens (not me) or doesn't enjoy the conventional purse styles (defiantly me!) I almost wish there was a button inside the comb of the chicken that would produce a ""clucking"" noise when pressed. But, maybe that's going too far. Haha.",,,02 Dec 2010

I do wish that the handles were longer....it is an oversight that requires you to hold it by its handles. I can just barely slip it over my shoulder, but it's not so comfortable and an extra 2"" on the handles would solve the problem. It really does look best over your shoulder because it looks like you're carrying a chicken under your arm. It's a riot! People at work actually ask me when I'm going to bring my chicken purse again but they have to wait until summertime.

I would still recommend getting your hands from here, but just expect a more orange tinge and a mix of left and right hands.",,,28 May 2017

The first package contained 10 x right hands (9 x Caucasian; 1 x POC). The second package contained 6 x left hands and 4 x right hands (of which 3 x Caucasian; 1 x POC). In total I have six full sets of tiny hands (containing a left AND a right), and eight standalone right hands. Loved the inclusion of POC hands (although they don't make a matching pair, just two right hands). The hands themselves are hilarious! They seem like good quality durable material, and have nice detail making them look more realistic. The holes are a good size for adults, but might be a bit big for younger kids.

1005,"crosley cr8005a-tu cruiser portable 3-speed turntable, turquoise",9.37,Won't play your Twenty One Pilots records,1.0 ,"Literally buy anything else, every one of these has a fatal design flaw that makes playing modern records impossibe: the speakers are built into the device...the device that relies on picking up very specific vibrations to play the music...think about that. As the speakers vibrate, the needle vibrates and skips. This isn't so bad on old, thinner records from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, but newer, thicker records with better bass response will skip all over the place. So don't ever buy an all-in-one turntable, because they will all skip when playing new records. If you don't want to spend the money on a proper turntable, proper speakers, and a proper amp/receiver, then seriously reconsider whether vinyl is actually right for you, or if you are just following a trend. If you value convenience over the experience of listening to an entire album all the way through, then feel free to take advantage of the last 30 years of advancements in technology. Another FACT that you need to know is that NO, vinyl does not sound better than CDs. It doesn't sound ""warmer"" or more ""true"". Assuming perfect media conditions, then the sound quality is INDISCERNABLE by human ears. Any perception that vinyl sounds better or even different at all is entirely placebo. In double blinded studies no one has ever been able to tell the difference between CD, vinyl, and even cassette tape. So why do people think that vinyl sounds better? Why do they like vinyl if it doesn't sound any different? Well because many young people alive today have only ever experienced iTunes, mp3s and other compressed audio formats. All physical media will sound better than an mp3, becuase it hasn't been compressed (had certain frequencies and sounds removed to save disk space). As to why people would prefer vinyl even though it sounds the same, I think people are tired of not owning their music. You can buy songs piecemeal from iTunes, but you never own them. They still belong to Apple and you're just licensing it from them. They can take it away from you at any time. But if you buy an album on physical media, then it's yours. And if you're going to buy something physical, you might as well get the big one with the nice album art. If you want a nice automatic TT on a budget, go with an Audio Technica LP-60. You can even get one with USB out so you can run it through your computer if you're too cheap to buy speakers and an amp. Oh and stay away from bluetooth speakers because they compress the audio and you might as well be listening to mp3s at that point. Good luck, kids!",,,21 Apr 2017

However, when it comes to these portable turntables, excitement couldn't be further from our minds. They are sleek and light but beyond style they fail miserably at their primary function: playing records. The main issue with these turntables is their lack of a counter-weight at the base of the tone arm. This weight is a vital component of any record player, as it set the correct force (grip if you will) on the record with the stylus. Without this weight you will have a stylus that skates across several of your records (180g records in particular). If you plan on playing Dynoflex records exclusively then you may be able to avoid any issues. Our recommendation: buy a record player with a counter-weight.",,,24 Mar 2017

1013,"crosley cr8005a-tu cruiser portable 3-speed turntable, turquoise",9.37,spins much too slow,1.0 ,"first off -- i didn't buy this. my brother-in-law bought one for his daughter roughly 6 months ago. she brought it to me today hoping i might be able to help her with it. the problem: it plays too slow at the 33 rpm speed. the speed also sometimes varies a bit, but never gets near the proper 33 rpm. i didn't try the other speeds except to note that the 45 rpm setting is too fast for 33 rpm albums (a good thing, but i didn't test to see if it played the right speed for 45's). apparently, when new, the player held roughly the proper speed. but the motor and/or belt has been fading away over the past few months. so i went to the amazon reviews where i first noticed that a full 1/3 of the reviews are two stars or less. a good many of the complaints are in regard to faulty speed. there is obviously a quality problem here that the manufacturer is not addressing. instead, in response to so many of the reviews, they point out the obvious that if the album is rubbing against something it will play too slow. that canned response gets to be a bit tiresome after the first 6 or 7 reads. i noticed several other complaints that hold true for my niece's unit but one must admit this really isn't meant to be a high quality product. if it would play the proper speed i would give it four stars for being pretty much what you should expect from it. as is it doesn't deserve even one star as it is simply useless. other things to consider: yes the weight on the needle is quite heavy and i would not put prized vinyl underneath it. the speakers do give mediocre sound but it was good enough for the money paid. my daughter connected an oontz bluetooth speaker using the headphone jack on the phonograph and the sound was good considering the system. this was the unit without bluetooth so, again, the bluetooth speaker was connected by a cord. interesting that at the moment they are charging you $20 more for the privilege of NOT having bluetooth. color availability i suppose. some people have complained about the needle skipping . i didn't have this problem. seems to me the company would do well to drop the input sockets and the rca output sockets and put the savings into a better motor/belt.

1017,"crosley cr8005a-tu cruiser portable 3-speed turntable, turquoise",9.37,"Pleasing to the eye, the ear thinks it's ok",3.0 ,"I got this as a gift and the design of the unit is very sleek. I've only had it for a day but have discovered a few things that might upset people in hindsight. --Summary-- It looks cool and sounds ok for the price you're paying. Unfortunately you need a pretty open space so the case can open up completely to prevent the record from rubbing against it. If you want higher quality when playing your records, I suggest investing in a higher end, professional turntable from Audio Technica, Numark, Pioneer, etc and plan on spending at minimum $100 (Note: these kind of turntables don't come with built in speakers). This is a fun little novelty item that's pleasing to the eye. --More Details/Helpful Tips-- 1. The case has to be fully open when playing records: I saw reviews saying that the records sounded warped or like the turntable's speed was off. I ran into the same problem at first. I tried have the case set up on a shelf with the top of the case sitting against the back of the shelf upright. I found out this was because the turntable was rubbing up against the case a bit. Once I put the turntable on the counter and leaned the top of the case as far back as it could go, the record played at its intended speed smoothly. 2. Your records have to be cleaned regularly to be played without skipping: I have a dog who sheds a ton. If there's a lot of dust/hair/particle build up on your record, the needle will skip. Google how to correctly clean your records. Once I cleaned mine off, the needle skipped a lot less often. If you're still unsatisfied after cleaning, you may need to upgrade to a better needle. 3. Speakers aren't the best: You're spending $70 on an all in one system so there you go. It won't be the greatest quality sound. The speakers don't have great bass. If they did, every hit of the kick drum would cause the needle to skip. Imagine putting a regular turntable on a sub-woofer. Just wouldn't work. If I want better sound when using it, I line out (on the back of the unit) to another sound system and get more of the frequency spectrum off my records this way.",,,03 Feb 2017

But the worst part is the built in speakers, they are absolutely awful. I have standards in my sound quality or I suppose I wouldn't care.

I do not play my older vinyls that I've collected over years from peddlers malls for great prices because I know it'll be far more for me to replace them for the great deals I got. Eventually I want to save up and get a nicer setup and have great audio because I love music and I love the original smooth vinyl sound. ***BUT I have to say if you're only going to be ""collecting"" new vinyl and playing it just for the nogalistic feel then I don't think there would be anything wrong with this turntable for you.",,,06 Jul 2016

I definitely recommend using external speakers with this player. The arm is also very light. Even some of my 180gram vinyls have a hard time playing on it. Luckily I have more serious record players, but if this is your only one be aware that some of the newer vinyls will still have trouble. I do love the record player it's self though. I love the design and color. I find it very girly for a girly girl like me. I also like to take it on road trips, and the briefcase style makes it much easier to carry around. I also think that it's design is just enough to brighten up a room and would be very good for kids. Also another thing to know is that there is no preamp in the turntable. It's apart of the Crosley design to keep the turntable light and at low cost. So when using the headphone jack you will need an amplifier or power headphones to get quality sound. Something to keep in mind if interested in buying this record player. So overall I do like this record player and recommend it to the not so serious and beginner collectors.

1074,"crosley cr8005a-tu cruiser portable 3-speed turntable, turquoise",9.37,Spend a little more on a better turntable,1.0 ,"To put it simply, this is not a good turntable. You've probably read most of the reviews and are confused because of how mixed they are. I was the same way, but I went out on a limb and just bought this turntable anyway. At first I had no problems, records played fine and the only problem was the atrocious quality of the built in speakers. I honestly don't understand the inclusion of these, because they are just not good, so I immediately plugged in some better speakers. After purchasing more records over the months, I noticed that a lot of them would skip, sometimes ridiculously. I thought it was the records at first, but after reading more about it, I learned it was the turntable itself. Simply put, since vinyl has become increasingly popular again over the years, brands like Crosley are trying to cash in and provide a cheap and affordable turntable to consumers. Well it may suck to hear this, but getting into vinyl is not cheap. It will cost you a lot for a great quality turntable, as well as other accessories such as preamps or receivers and speakers, and even the vinyl itself. Now I know you probably don't want to spend hundreds of dollars for an amazing turntable, especially if you're just getting into vinyl, and you'd like to keep it as cheap as possible. The best thing you can do is avoid this turntable, and instead get an Audio Technica AT-LP60 turntable. I've had this turntable for quite sometime now, and have had a much better experience. No records have skipped ever, and the quality is a big improvement over this. It's only a bit more, but trust me when I say it's definitely worth your money if you want to get into vinyl.

Steer clear of this if you're an audiophile like me but new to the vinyl ""scene"" or ""trend"" or ""movement"" or ""PAC"" of whatever the heck all the trendy ultrahipster kids call it these days (I wouldn't know, because I was a hipster before it was cool). Mkay, so the only thing this has going for it is that it looks good. Well great, so like nightshade it looks promising but will end up just killing you (maybe that's exaggeration but, hey, hipsters need melodrama too, amirite?). My Cruiser came defective right out of the box! It produced a horrible squeaking while playing. After disassembly I discovered the the spindle had not been fully lubricated. After reassembly I was good to go. Now let's listen to that sweet sweet vinyl sound! Wow, wow this sounds like crap, and yes I have it hooked up to my awesome sound system so yeah the problem lies in the player. And, is the record playing just a tad too slow? Really? I compare against a digital file... and wow, it's too slow by maybe 2% or so? Just enough to really irritate the phonically obsessed. So I say, hey...I'm a noob to the vinyl thing maybe I can improve it. So I tap into the worldwide knowledge base via my computational device. I discover that you can get better needles (er stylus) to improve the sound etc etc. I also come to find out that this cruiser is so heavy with the needle it'll probably ruin my vintage Star Wars Soundtrack (from episode IV, because the prequels are dead to me). Before I can even get the diamond stylus on there the player starts to echo like it's trying to win the World Cup of Marco Polo or something.I put the diamond stylus on there for fun, because hey I got nothing to lose at this point. And wouldn't you know it, it DID sound better, now the echo is clear and less grainy! So between the echo and under driven belt speed I gave up, I gave up so hard. Now I'm rockin an Audio Technica AT-LP60. For $20 more you'll enjoy the epic performance. If you're going to drop $75 on a total piece of garbage, you should really consider just spending the $95 for the AT-LP60. If you are an audiophile but new to the vinyl ""whatever"" then do yourself a big big favor and DON'T buy this piece of junk; try the AT-LP60, you won't be disappointed.",,,17 Mar 2016

1140,"crosley cr8005a-tu cruiser portable 3-speed turntable, turquoise",9.37,"Cute to the eyes, problematic for the ears",2.0 ,"I received this Crosplay turntable as an early Christmas present. It had been a while since l'd owned a turntable. I own a little over a hundred LPs and now finally had a player to enjoy them again. I was all giddy and smiles as l picked my favourites to play. On the first song from the first album l played, l noticed some... Issues. But first, let's start with the positives. On the plus side, this is a relatively small and compact turntable. It's as portable as it gets and it looks great. It's charming, classy and convenient. The choice of colours it is available in is astounding. It offers all the functions of a traditional record player at an affordable price and reads 33s, 45s and 78s. Being able to link an lpod or MP3 player is a great addition. You'll get a lot of ""Aw!"" from people when they first glance at it. It plugs and plays straight out of the box, no installation or effort required on your part. It's a cute record player and it would look great as a decorative accessory. That's all the positive l'm afraid. You buy a record player, it's primarily function should be to play records, the rest comes second. There are a few setbacks. As cute and affordable as the player is it simply doesn't play records as well it should. The vinyls tend to skip, it's usually not by a huge amount of time but it's certainly noticeable and disconcerting. I tested it -with both old records and fresh out of the wrapper ones- and l can safely say it's not due to the condition of the records themselves. I wondered if it was the needle but nothing seems wrong on that end. I read of other reviewers' experiences where the needle would drag along the record but it didn't do that to me, yet. The real problem lies in the flawed design of the Crosplay table. The briefcase design, as efficient and portable as it may be, is not fitted to play the larger records. The records tend to hit against the inside of the briefcase and cause skips. You can try and stretch the case as far as you may, nada, niet. It will still be ineffective. They still skip if this doesn't happen due to occasional wobbling and other reasons. I read about some people making it work with a quarter but sadly the old quarter on the arm trick didn't work for me. Not every record skips, but in my experience with this player usually about half the albums played will whether in small or significant way. What's strange is that there's a higher frequency of skipping on new records than old ones. I decided to read some reviews on the Crosley Cruiser and saw that l wasn't the only one experiencing problems. The amount of people who returned/received a deffective product is astounding. Maybe it was too good an offer to believe but playback issues ruin an otherwise great product. It's a beauty. It sounds decent enough even without speakers, but it skips far too much for my taste. Definitely style over substance in this case. As it stands, l still play this records on this turntable but it seems inevitable that l'll have to replace it and invest in something better. I suggest you do the same. In retrospect, if you're looking to play that one record you may never listen to again or use it as a decoration, it could work. If you're looking for a legit, affordable record player to play your collection this isn't it. I was also disappointed reading some of the comments regarding this product and thought ""Well maybe it'll work for me..."", it didn't.

Also, the more you invest on higher quality products, the longer your vinyls will last. I will say though, the only good thing about this product is how adorable it looks.",,,15 Nov 2015

The overall volume is not pretty loud, but it does have audio ports on the back if you wanted to plug it into a speaker or sound system, but if you don't have one available you can really only use it if you're next to it in a quiet environment. One issue I had with it was the lid, in order to play the large vinyls you have to open the lid pretty wide, since there are no rubber mounts on the back to secure the lid in this position the lid must rest on the power cord. This bends the cord and could break it over time. Luckily I quickly solved this problem by going to Home Depot and finding some rubber things in the plumbing section, which I could glue on to the rear of the player. The player does have a headphone jack which I think is great, but just the needle running over the vinyl creates a little noise, so don't think using headphones eliminates all sound. I highly recommend this player if you're willing to make a quick trip to home depot, but considering the quality and price of the item, I think it was worth it.",,,29 Oct 2015

This one went with my decor, was portable which was helpful in my tiny place, and was basically ""plug and play"" so it met that need. It does seem a bit sensitive. I didn't expect great sound and I don't have great sound. One time I plugged it in and it wouldn't power up, but simply unplugging everything and plugging it back in worked. I tried using headphones but the sound didn't completely go off on the unit while playing in the headphones. I decided to try to connect it via AUX to my sister's Jawbone speaker. It played fine for a while and then I noticed the sound didn't completely go off the unit. I saw the AUX connector wasn't completely in the socket so I pushed it in all the way. Then the turntable wouldn't spin. After two hours of trying to troubleshoot I realized, quite by accident, that it wouldn't turn if the AUX was completely in - so I have to let it hang out a bit. The manual's troubleshooting section was laughable to say the least; same goes for the online Crosley troubleshooting FAQs. Anyway, I can hear my records and I've had it several months so with my light wear and tear it seems it will hold up fine. I do think I will have to quickly determine a new entertainment set-up because I want my records to last long in good condition and I think I'll be an audiophile when I grow up.

This player, like a few other Crosley models, are sitting right next to vinyl displays at various retail outlets. So, if you're like me and have a teen who's discovering vinyls like they are something new, you'll be tempted to grab this player when you buy her/his first few albums. Please fight the temptation as these units are complete rubbish. If the album is not completely flat, or if it is not in pristine condition, or if the sun and moon aren't in perfect harmony, the album will not play well or at all. The players are toys and either never work well or work with only a handful or perfect albums. Your teen will be bummed and you'll think, ""Maybe it's the stylus so I'll buy a new one for $14.99 and swap it out."" Good luck with that. First, it's a thought of desperation that a brand new player might require a new stylus. Second, you'll likely never get the old stylus off without breaking the arm in the process. The ONLY thing a Crosley player has is built-in speakers, which sound tiny with zero bass. Don't let this fact, or the cool retro packaging trick you into buying it. You'll be so much happier purchasing an Audio-Technica AT-LP60. This player is well-built, has an AUTOMATIC start/stop arm, and sounds great. All you'll need is a separate pair of powered speakers, such as a pair of powered computer speakers. Some reviewers have purchased Bose computer speakers, Dayton powered speakers, or in my case, I simply plugged the AT-LP60 into my Bose Soundlink Mini's aux input.

That being said, the overall appearance is fantastic, I like how it looks sitting on my bookcase, and everything seemed fine until I tried to play records on it. I figured out the hard way, that the player MUST be sitting on an absolutely flat surface, NO EXCEPTIONS, or the wires do not contact in such a way that works. (I scratched a record figuring this out...) The speed settings on the player are nice, but kind of wonky. You have to move the lever to a certain spot for the record to not sound like its pitch is constantly changing (Another godawful flaw of this cheap turntable). The needle and arm are VERY lightweight, flimsy even. I was disappointed to hear that the needle wasn't making contact with the other speaker, so only one side gave sound, until I added a little bit of tape to give the arm some more weight. The last thing I'll mention, is that the speakers in this thing are very finicky. It defeats the purpose having speakers on front when I have to plug in an external set of speakers to be able to enjoy my records fully. BUT, used as-is, the speakers sound like ones you would typically find on a cheaply made children's toy. Those facts taken into consideration, I overall do not hate the product, but I don't absolutely love it either. It takes some DIY fixing up and some electronics knowledge to figure out what's going on inside the darn thing when it doesn't work correctly.

Thankfully, Amazon has an excellent return process and I got a full refund. I've since purchased a Sony record player for about $50 more.

Believe the other reviewers when they speak negatively of the speakers on this thing. They are so low-quality and horrendous that they won't handle the musical crescendos of the concerto -- as soon as the audio jumps, the speakers pop and fizz, instantly ruining the enjoyability of the music, and tarnishing the quality, really. The only way I can bear listening to the classics on this thing is to keep the volume on the bare minimum, so the speakers won't hiss at the crescendos. You don't even have to be an audiophile for this to bother you; if you're not DEAF and don't want your music impeded by popping speakers, I suggest looking elsewhere.

I was immediately disappointed with the sound quality that it would put out, the built in speakers are embarrassingly terrible and have far too much midrange which makes the unit rattle. I connected it through RCA cables to my home stereo with hopes it would improve, yet it still maintains a very thin sound. Ideally the purpose of purchasing and collecting vinyl is to experience the sound quality. This player also skips quite a bit on every track on multiple records. It's a nice clean design which is great, but that's about as far as it goes. I would not recommend this product to anyone.",,,11 Nov 2014

Upon reading the reviews for this product and many others made by Crosley, I have confirmed that Crosley is a terrible, cheap, brand and the only thing it has going for it is its aesthetics. Would highly recommend purchasing a different product if you want better sound and something that will not damage your records (the needle puts way too much weight on your records and is absolute crap as well; will destroy them within no time) overall a very cheaply made product not suitable for playing records.

I'm new to the world of vinyl, but on a budget and wanted something to play the few records I happen to have. I did some research and knew this machine was frowned upon by audiophiles, but not one site went into why these machines were so bad, just that they were. And with so many high reviews on Amazon from the average consumer, I thought, ""Hey, this thing should at least tide me over until I can afford something decent, right?"" Wrong. Right out of the box, this cute little machine gave me problems. Even my untrained ear could tell that the speed was not constant, that the noise was too much. I sat through an entire record hoping to warm up the Hell-screech of the speakers, switched over to my earbuds, and immediately switched back. Even with my moderate-level headphones, the sound coming out of this thing was worse than my iPhone's speaker. From this newb's perspective, let me share with you what is wrong with this machine: The music sounds uneven. There is something wrong with the sound. Some of it comes out of the onboard speakers, and what escapes through there is lost to any external sound system you can hook up to it. If your external sound systems even work out of it -- half of mine will plug in fine, but no sound comes out. It just doesn't sound good. I wish I could offer you a suggestion for a different unit, but this is my first. It's almost enough to turn me off of vinyl completely, except I know there is better sound out there, and I already have a 'table picked out for later. 1 star because it's cute and smaller than I thought it'd be. 1 more star because it seems to work right out of the box.

It was only a few steps above a singing greeting card. Also you could continually hear the song changing speeds/pitch due to the cheap belt drive.

Let me preface this by saying the vendor we bought this from, ivgStores, has been great so far. Nothing against them. The player, however is garbage in my opinion. The table is very light, the motor makes a very audible humming sound as it turns the table, the lid on the case has the potential to interfere with the album. The worst part, however, is the sound quality. Now, our unit had a broken right speaker out of the box, so it's possible the left speaker was also damaged...but the sound was quite abysmal. If you have an iphone handy, play a song through the phone speaker...that is *better* than what i was hearing out of this thing. I have to give it two thumbs down. The only redeeming quality is the case itself, which seems to be of reasonable quality.

1409,"crosley cr8005a-tu cruiser portable 3-speed turntable, turquoise",9.37,one MAJOR problem...,1.0 ,"Let me start with the good: This record player looks nice. It looks great in a small space, especially one with a retro-vibe. From a distance it even looks like a quality product, up close it does look a little cheaper (plastic, etc...) So, if you want this just for looks, have at it. But, if you want to play vinyl... here's the bad: Others have mentioned that the speakers sound ""small"" or bad, but I thought they actually sound fine, however, it becomes irrelevant because the sound produced is always at an inaccurate pace. All records I played were either too fast or too slow. At first they were always too slow. Then I noticed that LP's (33 records) were so big (and the player so small) that they were dragging on the opened lid. This is nothing more than an absolute design flaw and should have never been released for sale. However, I took the lid completely off and then found that records played at variable speeds. I was using the provided rubber slip mat, but it made no difference. Here is the problem: This player is BELT DRIVEN. Belt drive is simply a bad design and I will NEVER purchase another player that is belt driven. I'm sure there are some good players out there (for much more money) that are in fact belt driven and work fine, but eventually it will lead to this same problem. The solution? Buy a direct-drive turntable. It's the ONLY way to avoid this! I returned this and purchased an Audio-Technica AT-LP120 here at Amazon, and it's been the happiest purchase I've made in a decade! It's very pricey compared to this (I paid $242) so if you're not serious about LP's/vinyl I wouldn't recommend it. But if you are, and you want the best - it's an amazing value actually! Seeing a ""real"" turntable reminded me that this IS complicated business. It requires things like counterweights (adjustable depending on the stylus), anti-skate control, and tone arm assembly height adjustments. This Crosley doesn't take ANY of that into consideration! I don't write many reviews, but this product was SO poorly made, I felt I had to. Likewise, the Audio-Technica is SO well made, I will write a review for it too! I only paid $49.00 for this product (the red one) during a holiday sale, but $5.00 would have been too much, because it simply does NOT work! And that my friends, is one MAJOR problem.

With this being said this record player is absolutely fantastic for the value. It has a great sturdy build and is a great centerpiece for any room, as it is super easy on the eyes. The only pitfall with the player is that it can get some belt problems, which can be easily fixed. The built in speakers are sub-par, but this can be fixed by auxing the sound to an external speaker.

Once unpacked I plugged it into my home stereo receiver and tried out a few records. I recommend using external speakers if possible since the on-board speakers are small, and you are listening to vinyl. The reason I am giving 4 stars is that this unit is very light and the switches could have a stronger more friendly design. The briefcase top also comes very close to the bottom of the playing album. While it did not rub on the albums I have played, an older warped album may strike the lid when spinning so use caution if you are playing a lot of vintage records.",,,21 Sep 2016

She is having a blast. The retro look is also fun for her and her friends, and the sound is okay for the price. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is I wish there were a mechanism for placing the needle arm on the record. It has to be done manually.",,,09 Sep 2016
1495,"crosley cr8005a-tu cruiser portable 3-speed turntable, turquoise",9.37,but I thought it would be a fun thing to have,4.0 ,"I am not at all an expert when it comes to turntables, but I thought it would be a fun thing to have. I read a lot of reviews saying that this was a poorly made product that was a waste of money and not worth buying. If you're just looking for a turntable to have for fun, this can be a great option. It's also very small so it's easy to store and carry. The turquoise color is adorable and has a very retro feel to it. I didn't have any problems with the needle not having enough weight on it to play. You do have to be careful when moving around the turntable when it's playing a record. If you jump or make a lot of movement it can make the needle jump a little, but that's the only ""problem"" I have found with the needle. I do wish it came with a USB port to plug in my own music, but I can't complain too much since that would defeat the purpose of the turntable itself. I think the sound is great and I had no problems with the quality of the sound. Overall, I think it's a decent record player for the price if you are looking for an introduction to records.",,,05 Sep 2016
1496,"crosley cr8005a-tu cruiser portable 3-speed turntable, turquoise",9.37,Expect $300-$400 turntable performance and you'll be disappointed.,4.0 ,"I got one for Christmas a couple years back. I have it plugged into the line in of an old tube radio and use it to play old 78s that I have accumulated from the thrift store. It has a nice air of nostalgia to it. When audiophiles choose to listen to vinyl however, they're typically looking for the absolute best sound production that they can get, and spend big $$ for the privilege on both their equipment and music. This unit is definitely not suited for that. If you're like me though and have a collection of old records up in the attic or want to pick up some on the cheap and have a listen now and again without spending a fortune then this honestly isn't a bad choice, and it looks cool too. If you're planning on trying to get high fidelity or want to play expensive and/or rare mint condition records then this is sure to disappoint. In short, it is what it is. Don't try to fool yourself.",,,03 Sep 2016

It's affordable, easily portable, produces a great sound, and looks awesome! I absolutely love the turquoise color. I also like that there is a headphone jack and outputs for hooking up external speakers. The latch keeps the case securely closed, there are rubber grips on the bottom to keep it from sliding off of slippery surfaces, and it comes with an attachment so it can play 45s. My only complaint is that there is a small spot on the outer casing that got nicked during production or packaging (see 3rd photo). It was there when I took it out of the box. But it's so small, it's not really worth going through the hassle of exchanging it for a new one.

At first glance the turntable looks mighty small and cheap. almost too small for the larger sized records. I don't know why this color is called ""Turquoise"" because it looks more tiffany blue than anything else. My wife was having a bad day, and she looked almost disappointed when I showed it to her. But to my wife and I's surprise, it played flawlessly. Neither of us has ever owned one and we were able to set up and play a record within seconds. It's very user friendly and easy to learn and to add to the list of surprises, it plays very well. I bought this as a christmas present for my wife, but upon seeing it we opened it to make sure it was what we were looking for. It was. My wife's face went from tired, worn and sad to happy and full of life when she first heard it play. She loves the color and the ability to just unplug it and take it with her. The speakers are loud and clear enough for the price/size. Take into account this record player is ""portable"" so the sound quality isn't meant to be the greatest, but I was delighted. It's louder and clearer than our laptop speakers and filled our downstairs living room with music. Perfect for what we needed. Thank you so much.",,,23 Dec 2015

But, if you plug it into an external speaker, it sounds wonderful. I have it hooked up to a Beats Pill and I'm loving how vinyl sounds through it. The real issue I have with this turntable is that, for something that is marketed as portable, it can't be used with batteries. Why market it as portable if you have to have it plugged in?

1860,"crosley cr8005a-tu cruiser portable 3-speed turntable, turquoise",9.37,Good For Your First Turntable,4.0 ,"I got this record player as a birthday present, and after seeing the style and color I fell in love, and then I read the reviews. I was extremely discouraged at first to even play a used record on it after seeing all the complaints. When I put on the first record it sounded just fine. My friend who once bought a $500 turntable said that it sounded great even by his standards. I was ready to go online and post an awesome five star review, but then I decided to wait. When looking at all the five star reviews, it seemed like the writers just got the thing, while all the one star reviewers had owned the turntable for a while, so I decided to wait and see. I have owned the turntable for two months now and it is still playing records splendidly with only a very slight decrease in sound quality (even after playing the same used record for a month or so everyday). On new records it sounds even better. I never once had problems with skipping and the sound quality is great. If you are new to turntables, I would recommend, (especially if you are unsure if you like vinyl yet) but if you have experience and and is looking for a record player to last a lifetime, I would spend time else where.",,,20 Jan 2015

1863,"crosley cr8005a-tu cruiser portable 3-speed turntable, turquoise",9.37,Awesome Beginner Record Player,4.0 ,"I purchased this record player after having read all the reviews saying not to buy it because it was a piece of junk. With a little common sense I figured it wouldn't be a high quality product anyway; you get what you pay for. However, for never having owned a record player before (I am only 22, after all) I found it pretty easy to use and not a total waste of money. People looking to buy a record player with amazing sound quality should look into something more expensive. I bought this because I wanted that older, lesser quality sound, and that's what I got. So far I haven't had any problems with the way it handles records. A few records I bought have skips in them already but that is the fault of the record itself, not the player. The only problem I've really run into with this player is the lid. It has to be open pretty far back in order for it not to touch the record while its playing, but other than that, use the control for the needle arm, make sure there's not dust or anything sticking to the needle, use the rubber mat it comes with, and it's a pretty good quality record player for its price.",,,19 Jan 2015

I've been wanting to start collecting vinyl for a long time, but didn't want to do so without A.) owning a turntable and B.) starting off on the cheaper side to make sure I loved it before I went for more expensive models. A few of my friends recommended the Crosley Cruiser to me, and after thoroughly reading the reviews (yes, even the bad ones) I went for it. Now that it's here and I'm listening on it, I'm in love. I started off by just purchasing two records, Pure Heroine by Lorde, and The Acoustic Things by State Champs, and both sound amazing on this little thing! If you want loud volume, I will say that this turntable can be for you too! I personally prefer my music at a more comfortable volume so the built in speakers work great for me, but you can hook it up to speakers as well, so you're still getting the loud volume if you want. It came shipped so well, and I had it out of the box and ready to use within five minutes. I'm already shopping for more records thanks to this thing, and I'm very happy I chose it as my starter model. One day I'll get a more expensive and professional turntable, but this little thing is doing wonders for me so far!",,,30 Dec 2014

It has the weakest ""in the can"" sound and as you turn the volume up louder, its weaknesses become even more apparent. Of the 3, the Altec Lansing-The Jacket H2O 3 is BY FAR the best and highest sound quality. Both the JBL and the Altec Lansing work with your cell phone, adjust volume and skip/goback to the next song. The Altec Lansing reaches a louder clear volume.

It will lose signal sometimes and the music cuts out if I have it clipped to my belt loop and my phone in my pocket on the opposite side of my body.

In our house, we are Bose fans ( we own and love the Bose Mini Soundlink and the Bose Soundtouch but I didn’t like the price, reviews, or look of the Bose waterproof Soundlink Micro. I didn’t want to spend $99 for “Bose with a cold” as one reviewer said nor did I want to hand over something that cost $99 to my son. Anyway, long story short, I decided to give this JBL a try. So far, it’s uh-maaaaaaazing. Honestly, I’m shocked by how great this TINY speaker sounds. Also, it paired truly effortlessly with both my 2018 iPhone and my son’s 2017 kindle. I can’t yet speak to its long term durability when it comes to biking, camping and paddle boarding, but so far, for the price point, I’m super impressed by the sound and quality.

Since that makes it tough to take into the shower area, this thing is a bit less 'waterproof' than it advertises. I got sick-n-tired of trying to plug the silly thing in, when it made it's little 'time to recharge' chiming sound. Sigh. With the charging cable inserted, it is bothersome to turn on/off the device (since the cable drapes over the on/off indentation.

I've also used it on walks where I clip it to my key chain around my neck. The only con I can say is that of course for it's size, you're not getting thumpy or heavy bass, so if you're a bass head, then this speaker might not be for you. On the flip side, the sound quality is clear and crisp, with no distortion as high volumes. I also bought a case for the speaker to keep it protected. The speaker also comes with an auxiliary cable wrapped around it if you want to use it for older mp3 players. Overall, I'd say JBL knows what they're doing when it comes to sound quality.

At least the bass that is present isn't distorted. The bass and highs sound very good, but the mids might be a little low, but again the speaker sounds really good. The speaker is loud enough for a small room, but wouldn't fill up a large room. The speaker is definitely beautiful and the clip is nice and sturdy. The material it is made out of feels nice to the touch and seems to be high quality. One thing to note, this may be different than some Bluetooth headphones you may be used to regarding the built-in audio cord/cable. The Sony Bluetooth headphones I have are not required to be turned on or connected via Bluetooth to anything if I have an audio cable plugged in to them directly. That is not the case with this speaker though. Even if I have the speaker connected via the audio cable to an MP3 player, it must be turned on and it will automatically pair/connect with your phone. This can be annoying if you are using a separate MP3 player and a phone call comes in to your phone which was previously paired to the speaker. Not a deal breaker, but something to make note of.",,,15 Apr 2018

I have yet to drop it, but I have confidence that it'll survive any drops from a reasonable height. The carabiner clip and the built-in aux cord make this speaker all the more convenient!

2358,jbl clip 2 waterproof portable bluetooth speaker (teal),48.0,Must have for outdoor music lovers!,5.0 ,"This thing is awesome! I have a small addiction to portable speakers as my two favorite hobbies involve being outdoors and listening to music so when I saw this online for $50 I couldn't resist buying it. I really like the JBL brand, they have good customer service and I personally believe they sound great and are great quality without the crazy price tag. I have two JBL FLIP 3's that I was using for hikes and fishing before I got this but ever since buying this guy I have left them at home for use in the back yard (sorry neighbors). The clip on the top makes it extremely easy to clip onto your bag or your fishing vest and the fact that it is waterproof AND floats is equally amazing. The battery life is pretty impressive for the size of the device and the amount of volume it puts out. I believe I'm getting about 6 hours if its fully charged and I have the thing turned all the way up. Another added benefit of the speaker is that if you have a friend with a 2nd CLIP 2 or you are like myself and have multiples then you can wirelessly sync them together and play the music even louder. If you are always traveling and want something that is portable or you just want quality without breaking the bank then check this guy out. You will not be disappointed!",,,03 Jan 2018

I've had the original JBL micro for the past 4 years and needed an upgrade. My micro was not holding a charge for very long anymore...after 4 years of regular use, not bad at all and no complaints! The clip 2 will double my old JBL micros playtime from 4hrs to up to 8hrs of play!!! Love that the clip 2 is water proof, shock resistant and very portable. Sound is perfect for my needs especially when you consider the size of this thing. It's a very ""JBL"" sounding speaker, meaning it is very bright with decent bass, not a warm sound like a Bose speaker. For my use though this is perfect for cycling, by the pool and outdoors in general as it projects the sound well. Only bummer is that the bottom is not flat like my micro so it does not stand upright nor does it have a kickstand to accomplish this. I'll make due anyhow. The clip is convenient as well, attaches to almost anything. Great little speaker for the $$$",,,03 Jan 2018

Bluetooth or headphone jack connection. USB rechargeable (About 6 hours/charge) Connects to my Android phone quickly and easily Cons: Kinda rubbery coating gets dirty pretty fast, looks dingy (but easy to clean) It doesn't do a great job of telling you that the battery is getting low, it just shuts off.

My phone's speaker isn't powerful enough on its own. I've bought like 3 different rubbish, no-name Bluetooth speakers in the past, but we use a bigger JBL unit at my work and it's awesome. Sooo, I splurged on this thing for myself and it's...also pretty awesome! It's not as powerful as the tube-shaped ones they make and it won't make any audiophile swoon (bass sounds a little blown out), but it's easy to use and reasonably powerful for the size. The hook is handy for attaching it to furniture or even a belt-loop on your pants. I will lose its connection if you wander too far from the device you're transmitting from like any such speaker, but it reconnects very quickly when you're in range again. I also like that it makes a little noise when its battery is running low.",,,18 Dec 2017

It is a decent amount bigger than the last JBL Clip but is not too big or awkward and is also more sleek. The buttons are setup differently as well but overall are better because you can feel them without looking. The sound is much better than I expected from such a small speaker. The quality is clearer and there is actually some bass that can be felt/heard. I mostly use it on bike rides, while working out, in the shower or just generally on the go and the sound is perfect for all those scenarios. The carabiner feels sturdy and is bigger than on the last one so you can clip it to more things. The battery life seems pretty good. I used it a few hours a day for about 4/5 days off the original charge that it came with. I also like the fact that you can see the battery life on iOS (iPhone 6S.)

I wanted a powerful speaker and own a JBL Clip 2 already. This little round speaker is listed as 3 Watts. I got an Oontz Angle 3 Ultra OontZ Angle 3 ULTRA Portable Bluetooth 4.2 Speaker: Excellent Stereo Sound Rich Bass 14Watt Loud Volume 100' Bluetooth Range, Play to two together, Splashproof, by Cambridge SoundWorks which is listed at 14 Watts.Same price at 3W vs. 14W? The little JBL Clip 2 is perceptibly equally loud and has better high volumes tolerance. The sound is stable at maximum volume unlike the other speaker. I've gotten it in the rain but haven't used it in the shower. I like my electronics to be waterproof regardless. This clip is ingeniously placed...all mobile speakers should have handles. Great travel speaker. Most of all, the sound quality is so far unmatched against the Altec-Lansing mini-Lifejacket, Philips BT3500B/37 and the Ooztz 3 Ultra. Much clearer with less distortion with just 3W. I'd like to compare this to comparably Bose SoundLink Micro Waterproof Bluetooth speaker - Black . If anyone has done a comparison, leave a comment please. I found out it's not worth using bluetooth at all and that just plugging a double ended 1.5mm headphone cord into the CAR STEREO AUX jack and the other end into the iPad/iPhone. *Set the phone/iPad volume to max and use the car stereo volume control to adjust volume. It is, hands down, the easiest, cheapest way to play music in a car with an iPhone or iPad. I'll use this one while hiking and transport it back and forth to my desk where it hangs.

2581,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,Not suitable for all uses,3.0 ,"This blender is absolutely excellent if you exclusively use it to blend whole pieces of fruit and veggies. Personally I make a lot of smoothies with items such as yogurt and protein powder added in. The trouble is it has this very long three bladed pillar that extends almost all the way to the lid from the bottom. If you are trying to add in a powder or something like yogurt, it catches on all the blades, which means that unless you planned to fill the blender all the way to the top, that stuff won't make it into your smoothie and will instead stick and you have to scrape it in and blend again. Also it's ridiculously powerful even on the low setting, which again isn't good if you only want to make less than maximum capacity, since it splatters everywhere and you either lose a lot, or have to sit there and scrape it all out with a spatula.

2583,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,Cracked and leaking after less than a month's use,2.0 ,"I was very happy with this blender when I first tried it. I have always had 20 dollar blenders so this was a step up because it is much more powerful. I make smoothies and blend cauliflower for mash sometimes, but the primary reason for purchase was to make bulletproof coffee every morning. Upon first use for BP coffee it produced froth like I have never had and it was truly delicious. The reason I landed on this blender is because after doing research for the best blender specifically for BP coffee this was recommended if you are not willing to splurge for a Vitamix or Blendtec. At this point, I may have to do that, because even this blender has already cracked and is leaking after less than a month's use. Luckily I am still in the return frame for Amazon so they are sending me a new one (I also purchased warranty). Upon doing more research, people say in order to keep blenders from cracking when making BP coffee, you must release the air pressure out of the blender by taking off the top after no more than blending for 10 seconds. Then you can put the top back on and blend for additional time if needed. I am going to try this method, and hopefully it will keep it from cracking.",,,20 Apr 2018

Of course I picked the Ninja. First of all, look at the price and watts on this! 1,000 watts for soooo much less than the Vitamix. The newest Vitamix is 2.2 HP (1640 Watts) for over $600! Yikes. Don't get me wrong, they are a great machine, but for those of us who don't need programmable timers, hot soup and ultra silky smooth baby food, this Ninja is the best out there. This does just about everything the high priced one does. I use this for smoothies, this can take anything you give it and blend it right up. I make frozen fruit yogurts, (add the frozen fruit to fat free yogurt (I use home made almond milk yogurt). I use it for banana ""icecream"". Whip up frozen banana pieces, takes a couple seconds with this, then add peanut butter, chocolate, nuts, whatever you want. (I use Betty Lou's powdered fat free peanut butter). Of course you have to be careful handling the ultra sharp blades. I remove the blade assembly by the tip and set it inside the sink. I continue to hold just the top tip and use a bottle brush to clean the blades. I carefully set it back in the clean blender and let it air dry. It doesn't rust. I also make my own sauces and dressings. The grand kids like the ""snow cones"" this Ninja makes. I use diluted, sugar free Torani, and DaVinci coffee syrups, (brands Amazon carries). I especially like the simplicity of the buttons. Low, medium and high. Full speed and pulse. What more does anyone need? You just can't get a more powerful, quality blender than this for the price. Update: Well, it did blend the soft frozen fruit (banana, strawberries and blueberries), but I later tried mango and pineapple. Not so good. Chunks no matter how long I blended.

She suggested that we purchase another one and also the 200 dollar warranty that is good for 90 days. We only paid 80 dollars for it and the warranty does not cover mailing the product back and forth to be fixed. I tried to call back again to see if I could leave a complaint with their survey and she hung up on me. When I tried to call back, they had blocked my number.

2623,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,because I HATE THIS BLENDER so much,2.0 ,"This is the first time my three young children are all napping in the afternoon. Of all the (many many) things I could be doing right now, I chose to write this review, because I HATE THIS BLENDER so much. Let's count the ways, shall we? 1) The blade and blade holder is huge and does not allow larger chunks of fruit or vegetables to be placed inside the container. 2) The blades are all placed on the side, and none in the center bottom of the blade holder, meaning there is no centrifugal force, meaning that the blades scatter the components of your smoothie all over the container, instead of towards the center bottom of the container. This means that you cannot open the lid to add more liquid or fruit as it is blending. 3) The blades are not locked into place and fall out when you pour 4) It is unnecessarily loud, heavy, and clunky. 5) It does not blend properly. It is about as effective as a mortar and pestle. So in the spirit of fairness, I gave this thing two stars as it does sort of blend things and if you want to use it to make fruit smoothies, I suppose it does the job. However, if you want to make any creamy soups, vegetable smoothies, or sauces you are better off with a regular $30 Oster. My cheap blender does a more thorough job and gets less dirty. I finally thought I was rid of this nightmare when it (after only a year, with maybe bi weekly use) it crapped out on me. The manufacturer offered to send me a new motor, but I was to pay the $30 shipping. Thanks but no thanks. Verdict: Not even as good as a cheap blender. Does kind of blend.",,,26 Feb 2018
2624,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,"It blends, but I wouldn't buy it again",3.0 ,"I saw several reviews of this blender accompanied by pictures of lacerations. I thought to myself, ""I've been using food processors and other kitchen tools that have sharp, removable blades for years with no problems...."" Well, I have managed to avoid any injuries, however I have more sympathy for those people than I did before for the following two reasons: 1) the three tiers of blades mean that there is no safe way to dry this without blades sticking up in the air (unlike a knife or a food processor blade where you can lay it flat). Standing it upright the way it sits in the carafe will make it prone to tipping over. 2) the top part where you must hold the blade is small, tapered, and difficult to grip firmly with wet hands. My other complaint is that because of the three-tiered blade assembly, it is impossible to safely push things down into the blender. I make smoothies five days a week and the kale that I used to just press down to the bottom so that other ingredients would fit, I now have to blend for a moment to make room. Not a huge chore, but it slows me down. I don't love the locking lid and I fear the plastic moving parts will break before the blender wears out, but I've been using this several days a week for five months and that's still working fine. Bottom line, it blends reliably, I'm not going to replace it, but I wouldn't buy it again.",,,26 Feb 2018

Unfortunately when this blender arrived and from the very first time i used it, once i turn it on to blend the contents splash out through the top. I guess The lid doesnt fit properly or maybe its the rubber on the lid that isnt good. EITHER way in order for it not to splash out, i need to tightly hold down the lid while it blends.

The lid does not stay down tight on its own causing the machine to stop blending and I have to hold down the lid with some force in order to use. I do like it for times when I still want to leave bigger chunks such as when making salsa. But as my only blender it does not cut it.

The pitcher definitely feels and sounds cheap/thin like it wants to break. I swear every time I use it, the ice cubes are going to crack it. I use it mostly for protein powder shakes after the gym. Unfortunately the square shape means that powder gets in the corners and stays there. Also, despite using every possible setting, I can't get it to blend the ice well. I always feel the need to the shake a bit as bigger ice chips always remain. I always hand wash (which is easy - yay) this immediately after using and after just a month, condensation is collecting in the handle. Not cool. I do like the spout opening in the lid, which ensures that big blobs of shake or smoothie don't make messes as you pour.

Another criticism I have of the design is that the pitcher is square and that sometimes causes pieces of whatever you're trying to blend to get stuck in the corners. You then must stop the machine and use a spatula or some other tool to dislodge those pieces and mix them in to the rest of the liquid. Today was the last straw.

I received this blender as a Christmas gift and it is simply the worst blender I have ever come across in my life. The design seems cool on the surface, but in actuality it's just plain terrible... The multiple blade design makes it incredibly difficult to get ingredients in to begin with... as well as being scary af when you are cleaning them or if you forget to pull them out before pouring (like I did twice) they WILL come flying out... I'm amazed more people haven't lost fingers due to this since reflexively you will try to stop them from falling! You would think the multiple blades would ensure a smooth blend but somehow it does the opposite and just flings it all to the sides never creating a vortex drawing it to the blades? Whereas in a conventional blender, the blades are in the bottom and suck all the contents down to them... I don't know how else to explain it... Also, the square design of the vessel causes ingredients to get trapped in the corners on top of the not blending in general. Even attempting to periodically scrape the sides to help it along is freakin' impossible because the darn blades are in the way... Just all around an absolutely TERRIBLE design. The 5 attempts at making green smoothies in this thing resulted in transferring the partially blended contents into my 3 year old single serve smoothie blender every time. Like, literally couldn't get the liquid to turn green in the Ninja even after 5 minutes of blending, just reduced the greens to tiny confetti, but as soon as I put it in the NutriBullet...

2726,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,"Lid leaks old rinse water, poor design",2.0 ,"The only problem I have with this unit is that the lid leaks. This is a design flaw that the company has not yet acknowledged. The lid is manufactured out of two plastic parts that are factory sealed together. However, while washing or just rinsing, water gets into the lid between the parts. This water later leaks out into the glass when pouring the next time the blender is used. That's gross having dirty water dripping into your fresh made smoothie. I contacted the Ninja company and at first they did not want to replace the defective lid since I did not buy the unit directly from them. However after I reminded them of the one year guarantee against defects they did agree to send a new lid. As a one time special exemption. The second lid also leaks, same as the first.

It has held up nicely, it is nice and powerful for smoothies, ice, etc. I would definitely recommend it. EXCEPT for one major issue: the square design of the blender bowl is horrible! Every time I use it (smoothies, blending dough, etc.), lots of the food gets stuck in the square corners where the blades don't reach. So multiple times during every use, I have to stop it, open it up, scrape the food out of the corners with a spoon or spatula, blend some more, and repeat. It is super annoying. This could be fixed very simply by making the bowl round instead of square so that there are no corners for the food to escape the blades and get stuck. I would buy this blender again in a heartbeat if they changed this stupid square design!",,,28 Sep 2017

2771,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,Grainy texture -- Not thrilled,2.0 ,"I have mixed feelings about this blender. My main problem with it is that it makes smoothies that aren't actually smooth. They have little bits and pieces left in the smoothie, no matter what kind of fruit or vegetable I use. I used an Oster blender before getting this one, and the Oster one would make awesomely smooth blends without a problem. I even made flours with it! I'd put a grain of choice, like oats or even beans, and make flours to make my own sourdough gluten free bread! This blender would not make smooth flours, it'd only chop the grains up and leave large particles in it. Same with veggies and fruit. When I make a smoothie, I'm making a smoothie, and I'm expecting it to be perfectly liquefied. The resulting grainy texture is not to my liking at all, and no matter how long I blend for, I still can't achieve the perfectly smooth texture like my cheap $20 Oster did so well. I don't know what to do with it now. It's a recent gift, and a generous one. Now, I may be missing something here, and maybe I'm doing something wrong. But I'm putting veggies/fruits in, pour some liquid in, turn the power on, and then blend on high for a couple minutes. I never fill up the blender because I only make shakes for myself, so when I blend my smoothies, they are always about one-two cups in size, no more. So maybe that's the problem. But I can't make more because I simply can't drink that much in one setting.

2792,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,Good for this price point...,3.0 ,"I purchased the Ninja last week when I remembered I didn't have a blender at our vacation home. I needed something in a hurry and didn't have time to shop. I am using it for my green smoothies (spinach/kale, water, and some frozen fruit). I put the spinach/kale and water in the Ninja then liquify before adding the frozen fruit, ending up with a grainy drink with a shake-like thickness. I can temporarily live with the graininess, though this may be a problem for some. The blender container is large enough that I can make a double serving with no problem. The blade is scary, but I handle it with the utmost care and so far there have been no mishaps. The lid, container, and blade are extremely lightweight plastic and do not seem sturdy. They ARE dishwasher safe, making clean up quick and easy, but I've noticed the hollow handle retains internal moisture that does not dry in the course of the day (might lead to bacterial growth!). Overall this does not come anywhere close to the high end blender I have at home. I don't expect this blender to last very long.

2794,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,... and this is certainly no exception ...,1.0 ,"...and this is certainly no exception. This is simply a failure of a blender. The designers took something that essentially worked, the standard blender, and messed with it to the point where the standard blender's deficiencies are magnified. A standard blender only has blades at the bottom, which are bent to form a cyclonic action which draws the food to the bottom of the carafe. It has but one problem - if there is too much food in the carafe, and it's not very fluid (like fruit or nuts), then it won't adequately draw the food at the top of the blender down into the blades. It'll puree what's at the bottom and then you're stuck forcing the top parts down into the blades with a wooden spoon. I think whoever designed the Ninja must have been trying to solve this, but they failed spectacularly. The horizontal blades are clearly designed to increase the volume of food that is blended - but since they're perfectly horizontal, there's no cyclone action. This means you end up with layers of blended food alternating with layers of solid chunks. So the problem of the traditional blender is multiplied in this one. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.... since the blades go most of the way up the blender, they had to add a bunch of safety wank to it to make sure it won't run unless it's tightly closed and locked. So the only way to try to get it to blend properly is to shut it off, disengage the safety wank, completely remove the lid, and poke something down into the now-not-spinning blades to try to mix the food - which doesn't work because the blades alternate 90 degrees and you can't really poke anything to the bottom. So you end up leaving it locked, removing it from the base, and trying to shake up the contents. Well, if I'm removing the carafe and shaking things up to try to get them to blend, I'd say that's a failed product. I'm not one bit sure how people make smoothies out of this thing without going crazy from frustration. Add in the fact that the safety wank broke within six months and I now have to hold the lid down to get the safety to engage, and it's got a 1-way ticket to one-starsville. I didn't even care enough about this thing to leave a review, but Amazon shoved it in my face when I started looking for its replacement.",,,30 Jun 2017

Not worth the cost.,2.0 ,"Was really looking forward to getting this blender as I heard so many people rave about their Ninja blenders and I wanted a nice one to make fruit smoothies with on a regular basis. I was pretty disappointed with this one. PROS: - blades easily remove to make pouring and cleaning easy - nice pour spout on lid (don't have to remove lid to pour) - chops ice well CONS: - because the blades are in the middle, I find that some food items I put in just get pushed out to the sides and stick there instead of getting blended in no matter how long I let it blend. I have to open up and scrape the food off the sides to ensure that it all gets mixed together and there are no chunks. Even when I add more liquid in the mixture, this continues to be an issue. - does not chop up things like pomegranate seeds (included in one of the frozen berry mixes I buy from Costco) no matter how long I blend it. I end up chewing on whole seeds every time so I have started buying a different berry mixture so I don't have to worry about seeds but I shouldn't have to do that.

Then you have to release the lid, use something to scrape the sides, and repeat this multiple times. Then, after all that work, you're left with a chunky/textured mixture rather than a nice smooth smoothie. IT TERRIBLE!

I normally would give it 1 star because in terms of making a smoothie for MY liking is very disappointing. I am the type of smoothie drinker that doesn't do well with chunks or pulpy textures, I would rather have a smooth creamy blend. This machine I wouldn't call a blender because of where the blades are positioned. This machine is more like a food processor than a blender & even that's pushing it as my food processor can make a more smooth texture than this. If you are a person who doesn't mind chunks & pulp then yes this is a good machine, & I'm sure making your soup in here would also be good as it could chop everything up & then just pour it in a pot but don't quote me on that as I have not made soup with it. In terms of a nice smoothie blend than definitely not including green smoothie drinks like kale or spinach. I am also not happy with how the lid works - it has to go in just right or the machine wont turn on at all, if the blade attachment is even slightly off center you have to ""unlock"" the darn thing & try to get it lined up which can be a little annoying if you have loads of food in it as it will push the blade to one side & the lid only goes on one way to safely lock, a good safety feature I suppose but a bit annoying is all.

In addition, when I turn on the blender, some of the protein powder is thrown up against the sides of the pitcher. I have to use a knife to scrape the powder off the sides.

I can still see bits and chunks of baby spinach throughout my smoothie. Forget about blending other sturdier greens - I had to pretty much chew my smoothie when I added chopped up beet root leaves. I find I have to stop the blender several times to scrape the sides, as it throws chunks of fruit up the sides of the pitcher and they never get pulled back in to blend.

2877,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,ZERO STARS - leaked after only 6 weeks of use,1.0 ,"If I could leave zero stars I would. We purchased this to make Bullet Proof Coffee, and that is all it was used for in the SIX WEEKS we had it in our possession. We used it twice daily for 6 weeks to blend coffee with butter and MCT oil. We blended for a maximum of 60 seconds each time we used it. We never used ice in the machine while we owned it. After ONLY SIX WEEKS, it began leaking at the base where the blade attaches. There was no way for us to tighten anything. For the amount of money we paid for it, this was a HUGE disappointment. ""Professional""??? Yeah right!!! This is NOT a professional blender. PROS: It blended our contents quickly and efficiently. Albeit, it was only coffee and butter. OTHER CONS: The carafe is PLASTIC, not glass. I knew this when I ordered it, but I just cannot understand what's so hard about making a blender that is made with glass and metal. I owned an Oster for 20 years and it was awesome until the blade started to leak, and when we replaced it, the ""OEM part"" cracked within 2 months. They just don't make appliances like they use to 20 years ago. Also, this blender is HUUUUUUGE. It wouldn't even fit under my cabinets, so I had to leave the carafe off and sit it to the side, taking up twice as much of my counter top space. Also, it's VERY loud, but most blenders are. We never had any issues with the blade ""flying out at us"" like one review we read, you just have to be careful when pouring, which is where the spot comes in handy, or remove the blade to pour your contents. WOULD I PURCHASE IT AGAIN OR RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT? Absolutely NOT. I had the option to exchange it, but if an appliance can show that kind of poor design after only 6 weeks, I don't want anything to do with it.

No matter how long the Ninja runs, no matter how much water or juice we add, it simply does not turn fruits and vegis into liquid.

2967,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,PROFESSIONAL is a BOLD FACE LIE,1.0 ,"This unit is labeled ""professional"".....I bought one for a small scale professional kitchen in an office building. I used it mainly for making breakfast smoothies to order, marinades, salad dressings and also occasionally for blended soups, because it seemed so much quicker and more effective than using my little immersion blender. The blender claims it can handle warm liquids. I always let my soup cool in the freezer for 10-15 minutes before I blended it and then warmed it back to 165 after. I only filled the blender half way to be safe. Still the gasket on the lid melted and after it cooled it would just drop chunks of rubber into whatever i used the blender for. So I had tediously completely remove all the rubber from the lid to prevent contaminating food. On top of this after about 2 months tops of use there are stress cracks all over the pitcher. Again this kitchen is only open for breakfast and lunch 5 days a week, the blender does not get an overbearing amount of use at all. I tried to talk to customer service online about replace the pitcher and asking if they had something that could handle warm temperatures better. I was told all warranties would be void because it is for household use only. I replied then why is it named ""Ninja Professional Blender"" that is a bit misleading. They said ""well that is just a name, its for household use only"" I said ""between the misleading name and the snide customer service agent I don't feel compelled to buy another product from ninja"" next thing I saw : your session has ended......they hung up on me. I actually printed out this chat record, but never perused a complaint against them because I simply will never buy another product from Ninja and will bash their product to anyone I ever speak to. I actually inspected the box after all this.....It says professional in huge bold lettering on the top and all 4 sides of the box. Only on the bottom of the box do you say ""for household use only"" and also nowhere on the amazon page to purchase it does it say this. They do everything to trick you into thinking it can be used as a professional blender when it CAN NOT.

2968,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,"Plenty of power, but not for you smoothie lovers.",3.0 ,"This is a great blender I purchased for fathers day a few months ago. I make a daily shake of whey protein, a banana, rolled oats, Ice and water. This is the only thing I have ever tried to make in it. I had an older $40 black and decker model that wasn't blending that well anymore and was ready for an upgrade. The Ninja has tons of power, it makes quick work of ice cubes with the tower of sharp (crazy sharp) blades. It's straightforward and since the blades are removable I think it is easier than most to clean. My two biggest gripes are that the pitcher assembly and lid only fit on one way. I realize this is probably a safety feature, but it can be a little tricky to get everything lined up if you aren't paying attention. It's the same sort of first-world problem as plugging in a USB cable. Second is the quality of the blend. Other reviewers have mentioned this... I'll back it up. It chops everything you put into it. I have found no large ice chunks, and everything gets incorporated pretty well. What I'm missing is a smooth milkshake quality. My $40 Black & Decker produced a smoother consistency, even if It did have the occasional chunk of ice, I classify the blend quality as grainy, maybe closer to food processor quality and less smoothie quality. So, if you are going to be blending ice cubes and are expecting a ""smoothie"" experience, you probably need to look elsewhere.

I only use it to make shakes and smoothies with vegetables and fruit and protein powders and seeds. Basically, I don't need to chop stuff or make soups or frozen margaritas, so this review is from the perspective of someone who makes smoothies and shakes for health and dietary lifestyle. I got this for $99 at target thinking it looks great and has great reviews and has all these super blades so it must be good and work faster and operate better than what I had before... WRONG The good: - Ease of use, no 500 buttons to think about, just power settings basically. - Very easy to clean love that the blades come off to clean it easier and the diamond shape is nice to get in there and clean the bottom with a sponge. - It's pretty quiet The bad (this is the big problem I have and why I am going to return it): - The blades make it very difficult and basically impossible to put anything in there!!!! HOLY S--T what a BAD TERRIBLE design flaw. And according to the manual you cannot insert the blade after you load stuff, which would be convenient if you could. Nothing goes down that is not a powder or seed or small berries. You have to sit there and cut and chop stuff prior to putting in. My whole thing is I need these things to be quick and effective, I make meals for myself throughout the day in the form of protein shakes and I don't want to spend time chopping up fruits and veggies. The blade design is literally retarded and not conducive to any sort of practical operation. - I have used it for a few days now, and no matter what I do, I cannot get it to be smooth at all. Anytime I put anything solid in there like carrots, beets, apples, etc. it just makes it very grainy and to be honest it doesn't taste as good. It's like eating goo with walnut chunks made of fruit or veggies. It does NOT make anything smooth. no matter what setting you try. - I like to just drink directly from the blender and not have to do extra dishes and waste a cup... it is really annoying that the blades don't lock in, they fall out very easily, and it's difficult to handle them, and it's annoying and again, requires extra plates or napkins and stuff to make sure that the food dripping off the blades doesn't get on the countertop or table. Bottom line: I can't say it doesn't work and it's not built well, because it is, but for someone like me who has a very active lifestyle and wants this to make my life easier and not have to wash dishes and spend time doing things, it is very very bad. It's difficult to incorporate into my lifestyle and doesn't allow me to make things quickly and then move on. It takes 5x the amount of time for me to make smoothies and have this be ready for the next use compared to a $20 crappy ""little engine that could"" that I got in 1999.",,,01 Jul 2015

I don't expect normal priced blenders to compete (and so I run them for longer plus put less demand on them, like using refrigerated greens instead of frozen like I do at home). At first I was happy enough with this, but perhaps I started adding too many extras (which my VitaMix can whip up easily): oat bran, chia seeds, flax meal. The last few days I've dumped out half of my breakfast because I'm just too tired of CHEWING my smoothie (even though I decreased the amount of greens). A note about the blade. It takes care and management because it's a pole with six sharp, staggered points on it. There's an inattentive middle-schooler in the house and I make certain it is never near him or ateas he frequents in the kitchen: it's an accident waiting to happen. I do like the square container, the well-sealing lid (press button to release), and the black marks on its side for volume in cups. Attractive! Conclusion: I have decided to give this away. My GF has a Nutra Ninja IQ and it does noticably better at pulverizing ingredients (and while its blade still takes management, its 4 bladed, low height makes it simple to clean and keep safe). In fact, I'm online to buy additional Nutra Ninja IQ blender cup/lid sets. I'd even say the NNIQ is a competetor to VitaMix for people who want hard core smoothie abilities at a third of the price point of VitaMix (although you can save $100 off VM by getting refurbished directly from manufacturer). The NNIQ's smart button includes pauses which lets ingredients fall down (replacing VitaMix's plunger) which works pretty well. (Oddly, for reasons I can't figure out, better than the bottom-of-their-line, $300 BlendTec blender I tried out from CostCo). A definite plus to the NNIQ is that the blender's base is small and its height is low, absolutely enough to fit under the counter (I'll store extra blender cups in cabinets anyway). That's important to me because I like ZERO appliances on my kitchen cabinets but the GF (who will probably be moving in to my place soon) feels just as strongly about keeping the most frequently used ones out. It's so small I can compromise for keeping the NNIQ out without taking too big of an ultimate hit.",,,07 Jun 2015

2983,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,"OK, but not great for smoothies",2.0 ,"We use the Ninja for making smoothies. We like our smoothies thick, and put them in a container in the morning and drink them at lunchtime. The Ninja is FAR more powerful than the old C...art machine it replaced and it can crush nearly any frozen fruit in seconds with no problem, however, it has two flaws: It whips way too much air into whatever you are blending. If you fill the blender half full of fruit, water and protein powder and turn the machine on, within 20 seconds the machine is overflowing with foam. So the resultant drink is very ""frothy"" at first (I think too frothy). But if you let that smoothie sit in a container for an hour or two, the air bubbles work their way out, and the end result is a half-full container with a near-solid mass at the bottom. The old machine chopped the fruit without whipping in so much air. The blades are deadly, removable and held in place when the lid is on. But the spout in the lid is not large enough to allow thick, frothy smoothies to come out, so you must remove the lid before you pour. If you don't remove the blades first, the blades can fall out.

To top it all off, my smoothies come out with little pieces in them, nothing like the creamy ones I made with my old Hamilton Beach.

I mainly use the blender to make smoothies, using frozen fruit and fresh fruit and vegetables and it does an okay job pulverizing and mixing everything together, but not creamy like the description states. I took a star away because I'm finding that I need to remove the lid in the middle of blending in order to push the contents back down to try and get everything blended better - the frozen stuff blends well, but some of the fresh does not. My Nutribullet did a far better job with my smoothies than this blender does.

3002,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,"Grinds a greater amount, but not as fine",3.0 ,"I bought this primarily to use for grinding flax seeds, which I have ground by use of an Oster 14 speed for years, now. After I initially set the Ninja up, I immediately experimented by grinding various amounts of flax seeds by use of my new Ninja, and here are my observations: Due to the jar and blade configuration of the Ninja, No fines compacted on the bottom. Hence, you don't get the complication of consistently having to stop the blender to dig out the compacted fines on the bottom as one does with an Oster. How well and quickly the Ninja can grind flax seeds does not appear to be dependent on the amount of flax seeds one starts with for any given grinding effort. So, you can grind a large batch with the Ninja and the resulting ""grind quality"" will be identical to that of grinding several small batches with same. This is not true when it comes to the Oster, at all. The NInja cannot grind the seeds to dust as can the Oster. Surprising, but very true. While I do have to add the seeds in much smaller batches when using an Oster, as well as stop and fiddle with getting the fines from the bottom, the Oster can, in fact, grind flax seeds to a uniform dust. The Ninja will put out more energy than the Oster (as can be detected by the warmth of the ground seeds), but still not grinding the seeds to near as fine a mesh as the Oster. Fine ground flax seeds are yellowish in color, the seeds themselves are a reddish color. When I use the Oster, the finish product is the desired yellowish color, one indicator of a good grind, whereas with the Ninja it is a mixed yellow/light red - indicating non-uniformity in the level of the grind. You can also easily feel the Ninja's ""finish product"" is not uniformly powdery, of course. So, compared to the Oster, the Ninja can grind much, much larger batches at one time and does not require any additional effort, but at a lower grind quality (mesh and uniformity) than the Oster. I would have given it 5 stars if the Ninja were capable of both grinding larger amounts, and achieving a uniform fine mesh. As it stands, I would give it a 3.5 rating, if that were an option.",,,19 Dec 2014
3003,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,Reasonable Performance but not Professional Performance,3.0 ,"This is a really good looking product. Fits under your counter and does a reasonable job for average applications. I have owned a variety of smoothie makers, and blenders at every price point. What I noticed is that blenders that have a stick blade, fail to really pulvertize the food. Because there are a number of blades on the stick, it seems like it's going to grind your food up really well. However, I did not find that because the machine didn't have the power handle an ultra smooth puree. Ultra smooth purees is quality I was looking for. I like to make Spinach smoothies. I placed my frozen fruits and liquid in and then attempted to add my spinach. Because of the blades being so high up, I struggled to get the spinach down into the machine. Even if you place the spiniach in first, the side blades make it difficult to get them down in the blender. Once the machine running, after several attempts I realized that my smoothie was not going to liquefy completely so it's texture was rather grainy to the taste although it looked smooth. Additionally I did not find the handle comfortable, and making sure everything was locked and clicked into place was an added nuisance. I also fear these plastic lid parts are going to break off soon. It was easy to clean up, but for heavy (daily) use, I don't think this is going to work out. I liked the product generally but i'm rather underwhelmed by it's lack of power. As a baker I also do a lot of nut and fruit purees and this machine isn't going to cut that. I think calling this a Professional Blender is a marketing name because this machine isn't capable of giving professional results. Yes, it chops ice, but if you are looking to blend your things into ultra smooth purees, this machine falls short.",,,07 Nov 2014

3040,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,Impressive ice crusher and smoothie maker. Just wish it was compatible with individual blending cups.,4.0 ,"We've been battling our blender's ability to crush ice for years. Since our kiddos are huge smoothie fans and we enjoy frozen drinks, we needed a blender that could get the job done without leaving chunks of ice and a metallic smell in the air. After reading the stellar reviews and watching the impressive ice-crushing infomercial, we decided to invest in a Ninja. When this particular model had a flash sale ($53.49), we pulled the trigger. Pros: 1) It crushes ice and frozen fruit like a powerhouse, leaving no chunks behind. 2) The blade design is brilliant. Easy to insert and remove with one fluid movement. (Just don't forget to put blade in before blending!) 3) Blade removal makes pouring, scraping, and cleaning easy. (Be careful, it's sharp.) 4) Secured top system locks out leaks and splashes. 5) Flip spout allows small food items and liquid to be added while blending. 6) Has the ability to pulse or run blender hands free. 7) Holds a TON of liquid. Great for lots of people. Cons: 1) If not full, dry items (spinach) will jump to the top and stick to the sides requiring stopping and stirring manually. 2) Does not pair with individual blending cups as recommended by Amazon. 3) Cord is too short. Difficult to accommodate to outlet. Given the $54 price tag, this blender is well worth the money when entertaining and blending for groups. It gets the job done quickly and efficiently and crushes ice like magic. Cleanup is easy - simply rinse the extremely sharp blade and air dry on counter and throw the pitcher in the dishwasher. Because of the excellent top-lock feature and no openings on pitcher base, little to no residue gets on the base. I love this blender, but if I had it to do all over again, I would bypass this model and order an all-in-one Ninja blender that has the option of using smaller cups for individual drinks. Our smoothie blending would take much less time if the area inside the pitcher/cup was filled with more food/liquid so that sides didn't need to be scraped of spinach. Plus, we'd have the added individual smoothie cups for our two children, allowing them to choose the ingredients inside. While they're battling over smoothie choices, my husband and I could enjoy blending frozen margaritas in a bigger pitcher. Amazon - please stop pairing it with the ""Tritan Nutri Ninja cups."" They're not compatible with this unit. Bottom line: Ninja packs a punch I've never seen with other blenders. It's my new brand of choice.",,,19 Apr 2018

3043,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,Great and very affordable!,5.0 ,"First of all, this is my first blender that was manufactured later than the 70s (thanks Mom for the hand-me-down Osterizer)! I am a product of the 80s, so yeah. Obviously, much improved. I've been excited to get up this past week to make my coffee smoothies before work! It is loud, I hope that my neighbor doesn't hear it downstairs, but I don't know if there is such thing as a blender that can quietly chop up ice. One of my cats watches me prep my smoothie but runs when I turn it on, and the other cat runs over to see what is making that noise, so it's tolerable for a non-fraidy cat. I've read reviews of complaints that the blade doesn't snap in and people have cut their hands, so I was nervous about that. But I sat down and read the instruction manual all the way through and it states it a bunch of times that the blade doesn't snap in and to lift it out before you pour with the lid off, so I've paid very close attention to that! Always be sure to read instructions! Reviews have complained that the blender somehow broke within weeks of purchasing it. If you read the instructions, you'll see to register it within 10 days and they have a one year warranty. I highly recommend this blender and it's super affordable! My Mom said her Vitamix heats up whatever she puts in it, so I was worried my smoothie might come out warm, but it stays cold. Maybe it's a better blender for 1/4 of the cost? Pro-tip (from Mom): After using, fill the blender with warm water a little bit away from the top with a tiny amount of dish soap and run on high and it washes out the pitcher. :)",,,18 Apr 2018

3048,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,Love it,5.0 ,"This is the first legit blender I’ve ever owned. We always bought the cheap $15 ones at Walmart and it did the job but took forever. This one is amazing. Blends so quickly and thoroughly! Can add in all the ingredients at once without worry of clogging or anything. I use it at low speed always because even at that setting it gets the job done quick. Now, I’m certain some of you are now anxious about the horror stories you’re seeing on the reviews of cut fingers and toes. I was, too...but my mom bought this for me and swore by it because she has one. I’m starting to think the injuries are MAINLY user error. Don’t try hand washing these blades, first of all. You will likely cut yourself due to slippery metal. I wash mine by adding hot water, soap and blending it a few times. Never had an issue with residue. Granted, I don’t have a dish washer so if you do, use that. Now, as for the blades popping out, yes they can easily do that. But only if you’re tipping the blender upside down without the lid on, or properly locked on. If you have to pour your smoothie or whatever out, there’s a specific opening in the lid for you to do this safely! Don’t remove the entire lid and pour! This will definitely make the blade pop out.",,,16 Apr 2018

3089,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,This is the best blender I have ever had,5.0 ,"This is the best blender I have ever had, by far. I think it may be better than the $300 juicing machines. The secret is the multi-tiered blades. The top blade is almost at the top. No matter what you put in, it grabs it and grinds it up; frozen, leafy, hard, soft, whatever. You never have to push the load down. This blender makes perfect smoothies out of frozen fruit without any extra fiddling. Leafy stuff like kale can be added in at the top and it just sucks it down and grinds up. Amazing! It has lots of power. It does not slow down on a full load of frozen fruit. Even though the container is plastic, it seems very strong. I have had my blender over 1 year, and the container is in perfect condition; no cracks or scratches. When it does frozen fruit, it makes a loud noise like rocks are being thrown around inside, but then it quiets down after everything is ground into smaller pieces. The best smoothy maker ever!",,,03 Apr 2018

If you pulsed it a few times and then run it long enough for liquify it does a good job for smoothies and ice drinks. One thing people tend to underestimate is the amount of time yo should run a blender for smooth drinks which we were taught in bartending school was usually 2-4 minutes but I always see people running 30 seconds and wonder why it’s lumpy. Generally if ice or frozen fruits are involved you can hear when it’s done.

3095,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,Fantastic blender for the cost but watch your fingers,5.0 ,Recently had to look for a new blender when my Vitamix started overheating and shutting down with very limited use. I considered getting a new Vitamix but thought for a fraction of the cost why not try out the Ninja. So far I have been favorably impressed. It's not nearly the power of my Vitamix (1000w vs 1380w) but for what I need to do it has worked fantastically. I mainly use it for grinding up fresh coconut meat to make coconut oil and for that task so far it has worked fantastically. I like that it doesn't get air pockets like my Vitamix used to get all the time. The only thing I don't like about it is that I can't take off the top of the pitcher while it's blending like I could with my Vitamix...I liked being able to take a spatula and push the stuff sticking on the top/sides down while it's blending...now I have to turn it off to do this. Not a deal breaker for me though. Warning...there are a lot of blades and they are very very sharp...sliced my finger the first time I tried cleaning it.,,,31 Mar 2018

3269,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,The Best Blender In The World,5.0 ,"This is the best blender I have ever had. I know there are probably better blenders out there, but for me, I call this the best blender in the world! I make a breakfast smoothie with ice, bananas, almond milk, and a chocolate powder every morning. I no longer have to slice my bananas. I put a frozen banana in this blender whole and with one hit of the pulse button, it is blown to pieces. I could be done blending a smoothie in 20 seconds as opposed to 1 minute with a cheap $20 blender. I’ve also used this blender for cooking. I had a recipe that called for an egg with ricotta cheese blended together. In seconds I had a creamy, pudding consistency mixture. One time I was out of bread crumbs so I took stuffing and pulsed it around a few times. It turned those chuncks of stuffing to dust. I can’t speak highly enough about this blender. Everyone should have one! I’ve had it for several months now and I am obviously still so grateful to have it in my life lol. Lastly, to reiterate on previous reviews, the blade nozzle is not attached to the blender. If your pour without the lid on, the blade is going to fall out, and you run the risk of injury.

3306,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,owned 6 weeks,4.0 ,"I'm a healthcare professional and bought this after researching the competition (i.e., ""Vita-Mix). After reading through a gazillion comments and reviews (including CR who rates the Ninja #2) I opted for the lower priced Ninja. I have used mine twice a day for the 6 weeks I have owned it, I use it for making smoothies. I blend for health, I have a morning fruit and berry smoothie and I have an afternoon veggie smoothie. Blending is a really convenient way to get in all your servings of fruit and veggies each day without removing the (very important) fiber. So far, I love my Ninja. I have had stuff made with a Vita Mix in the past, but have never done a side by side comparison, though I can think of a few differences that are meaningful for me. One, the Vita Mix generates heat. They use it as a selling feature, that you can use it to make soups, but I like my smoothies cold, so it's not something I look for in a blender. Secondly, Vita Mix seems to win in all the comparisons with Ninja on smoothness, or thoroughness of blending. The only reason I knocked one star off the Ninja is because I have noticed that my smoothies are a bit chewier after several weeks of blender use. I attribute that to the fact that Ninja relies (apparently) on their sharp blades, which naturally dull with use-especially when blending frozen berries or ice (which both of my smoothies contain). I've noticed a subtle change in texture, no chunks, but definitely not a fine blend. My understanding is that Vita Mix has dull blades that work for years, they do not rely so much on sharpness as they do on speed? The other thing (in addition to heat) that you get with a Vita Mix is aeration (foam), which I do not notice with the Ninja. My smoothies are full of fruit and veggies, so they are full of fiber. If you are okay with having some noticeable fiber in your blend over time, the Ninja is a great deal at about 1/5 the cost. If that matters to you, expect that you will have it in time (I started to notice it after about 25 blends). The blender cleans very easily and is simple to use. I've never had to remove the top to tamp stuff down and I use 3 cups of leafy greens like kale and arugula, as well as whole carrots, celery, apples, and never have chunks. Overall it's a great machine. I cannot rate longevity since I've only had it 6 weeks, but so far I'm very pleased. Update: It's January 2018, I owned the Ninja about 3 months and ended up getting a Vita Mix. I still stand by my original review, but there is a difference. The Ninja starts out pretty great, but then over time things do no blend as well. I drink 2 smoothies a day (one veggie, one fruit), so I use it a minimum of 2x a day. Over time I started calling my Ninja smoothies: ""grainies."" The blades start out very sharp, and the technology depends on that, but they dull with use and it shows in the results. The Vita Mix does not depend on blade sharpness, but power, it pummels everything to pieces (itty bitty pieces). I am amazed at the flour I can make with it. Also, the heat i mentioned is not a factor but a feature. Most things are blended in less than a minute (35 seconds often), so nothing really gets warm unless you leave it on in order to generate heat. The Ninja is a good blender, especially for the cost, but I don't think one can fairly compare it to a Vita Mix, it's like comparing apples and oranges.",,,05 Jan 2018

3348,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,because it could easily mince up a hand full of fingers if you ...,4.0 ,"I've had a few blenders over the years. There was a Krups that was a wedding present and lasted about 15 years followed by a much nicer Breville that lasted maybe 2 years total. It was the cheaper of the two similar models, but out of the box, I could tell that the motor was under-powered, especially at it's higher settings, it smelled smoky, even new and eventually it burned out. So, for it's replacement I landed here. Didn't want to spend several hundred dollars, but went for wattage/hp this time and it shows. Confidence inspiring and I'm sure will handle whatever I throw at it. I make smoothies almost every day with frozen fruit and it handles with ease. The blades are crazy sharp and stack up through the pitcher and seem to pull the contents down, so everything gets crushed/blended. The pitcher locks to the base and the lid locks down on the pitcher and the motor won't run unless both are locked into place. I think this is a safety feature, because it could easily mince up a hand full of fingers if you got them in there. The blade stack lifts out, which makes cleaning easy. After about a month of moderate-heavy use, I'm impressed and happy. This is a very good blender.",,,13 Dec 2017
3349,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,BE VERY CAREFUL,5.0 ,"First off I'm giving this blender a 5 star review even though I'm saying be careful. This is why- when I first used it I was amazed how powerful and fantastic this blender was. I was making ceasar salad dressing for a family dinner. It made quick work of a usually long process. Which is exactly why I bought it. However, with other blenders I usually take the lid off and pour my substance out of the container. When I did this the huge blade fell out and cut my finger very badly leaving blood in my dressing. I too was traumatized like others had said but I was so impressed with the results I went back and figured out what I did wrong. The main problem was I needed to REMOVE THE BLADE from the container as it is not affixed to it. It is just ""sitting"" there. Once I was aware of that everything was fine and I love it now. Only thing is, the directions should have large lettering or warnings about this and they do not! So BEWARE!",,,13 Dec 2017

First off the power of it is amazing compared to all the other blenders I've used such as Oyester, Black and Decker, and a couple others. It's power is far stronger than all the others I've used, but what's more amazing about it is that it's so much quieter than the others. It's a win, win situation for sure. This blender is also a food processor so the range of things that can be done with it is limitless. I enjoy juicing fruits and vegetables, but don't like typical juicers because it throws away all the pulp, and that is where the vast majority of nutrients are. With the Ninja I get the best quality of fresh juices, smoothies, and protein drinks. I also really enjoy making my baby's food, and with the Ninja it truly makes it a breeze. Only the Best for my little one! I have also made soup with it by blending my steamed veggies and then heated on the stove. The cleanup is so much easier than any other blender I've used as well.

3413,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,Tons of Room and Power,5.0 ,"After years of using and burning out cheap blenders I finally decided to upgrade to this quality blender and I am so, so glad I did. This has a very sturdy base which does not shift while blending. The carafe locks into place with ease and does not shift at all while blending either. The lid also locks into place and does not move while blending or pouring so there is no need to hold the top of the blender while it is going. The carafe holds a ton of stuff as well so fewer batches are needed when pureeing large recipes such as soup. The blades are super sharp and slide into place quickly and easily. They are not mounted to the bottom (similar to a food processor blade) so it is easiest to keep the lid on and pour through the pour hole on the corner and then remove the lid and blade unit for washing afterwards. Contrary to other reviews it does not ""pop out"" for no reason. It does, however, fall out if you hold the unit upside down with the lid off (due to gravity). This is incredibly powerful as well. I very rarely need to process anything for more than 30 seconds no matter what it is. I puree soups and make smoothies and milkshakes all in under thirty seconds of blending. Ice simply gets eaten up and there are no large chunks as I've found with other brands and models. I also use this to puree food scraps for my worm composting unit and it fully purees a full carafe of eggplant peels, pepper insides, and celery ends (along with some water) into a V8 consistency in thirty seconds. Overall, this is one of the best additions to my kitchen this year and worth every single penny. I highly, highly recommend it.",,,10 Nov 2017

Considering that this model wasn't much more expensive than my old blender, it's a wonderful value. Watch the video on how to clean your blender so that you don't have to come in contact with the blades. They are sharp as razors, but if you use the soapy water method immediately, you shouldn't have to touch them.

Call me stupid, but I washed it with a sponge in my hand before the first use and I got five cuts on my hands including one deep cut, all within 10 seconds. The sponge looked brutally abused too.

3443,ninja professional blender (bl610),79.0,Great blender!,5.0 ,"This is my third Ninja, and I'll keep buying them until their quality dips. Now, you may ask why I like them so much since I've had three of them. You may be thinking they keep failing me. But you'd be wrong. They're actually tough as nails. My family just uses them so much that they get all 'gunked up' and a bit unsightly to look at. The end result is that I buy one about every 5 to 7 years. But all three are still working. We use the older ones for things outside the house, such as friend's parties. Anyway, the buttons on this one are very easy. You really don't even need a user manual to get started, but you do need to know how to afix the blending element into the motor base correctly. This is a top-notch blender and blends everything you can throw at it. Like every other blender on the market it's pretty loud at higher settings but that's because it's doing its job. It eats up ice in no time, and blends fruit and vegetables with ease. The handy reclosable spout on top of the container is great because you can store it in the fridge as-is until you've used all the product in the container. Then you just wash it back up and put it back into service. Ninjas are relatively expensive, but they are well worth the extra money in my view. Get it and you won't regret it!",,,31 Oct 2017

I truly enjoyed this wine bottle opener, which is why I went back to it again. I believe it is well priced for the product and does the job easily and efficiently. Much easier than the do-it-yourselfers where you have to work hard to get the bottle open! For some reason, the one I purchased in late March 2017 just won't hold a charge and I followed the instructions per the user guide. When I try to use it, the cork takes a long time to come out of the bottle and then the mechanism will not release the cork so I have to manually work it out myself making it much more difficult than a handheld. As for a return, it's far past the date. You only get a month to return it to Amazon.

I am happy to report this opener is even easy for the wine opener operator to use after consuming many, many, bottles of wine in one evening. Just put it on the bottle and push the button and the cork is removed. Then if you have any left over energy and motivation you push the button in the opposite direction and the cork pops out of the opener. One night it was even tried it on a can of beer. However, it does not work as effectively on beer cans. It wasn't me that tried opening a can of beer with this wine opener. I am writing this review for a friend.

And I wan't paying attention and I didn't let off the button. Bang, crunch, crack.... the cork screw went down in the cork as it should and drug the guts of the unit with it. The case halves parted, the case screws broke off and the opened like an aligator's mouth and passed over the top of the bottle. what a sight. Guess I'll buy another one.

4369,"oster cordless electric wine bottle opener with foil cutter, ffp",17.99,5 years strong and finally retired (my fault),5.0 ,"Back in 2012, my younger, less hangover prone self purchases this on impulse in a rural Walmart in ND (yeah, ND- long story). I convinced my then roommate that this was an “investment” and I HAD TO HAVE it, for the $25 it was back then. As the years past, I laughed and laughed about my investment remark, because....well, it was! This thing was fearless! I must have opened hundreds of wines easily with it, and it has always been a conversation starter when brought out in front of company. Fast forward 5+ years later, I retrieve it to open a bottle, and my clumsy hands drop in on the floor (now like my phone, I’ve most likely dropped it before multiple times), and the button broke off! No harm, no foul, it did last me 5+ years, AND, if I held the button in the correct place, it continued to work (which was great in the moment, yet sad...so sad). My BF knew how much I loved it (and so did he, because he found it fun to open bottles just as much as me), and was gracious enough to purchase me another for Christmas (maybe Santa, who knows), but it was a different brand. It was hard for me to part with, but I will always have those “investment” memories.",,,28 Dec 2017

The wall protecting plastic bar is made of poor material in which the bolts easily stripped the plastic when trying to even loosely tighten it.

This leaves me with a loose dangling arm, which basically means that I can't use the product.

Extremely poor construction and the box did not ship with all of the nuts and washers for assembly. I understand that this is a cheap option for a pull up bar but you don't have to be so blatant about it. I weigh ~240 lbs but this bar has permanently deformed and it on the verge of separating in the middle joint where one bar is slid into the other every time I do a pull up. It says it's designed for 300 lbs which I'm not close to, so either I received a exceptionally out of spec product that slipped through quality assurance or the design is marginal and they should advertise a lower max limit. The 300 lbs limit that is specified must be 300 lbf that factors in the additional load on the bar from acceleration and is not based off a 300 lbs individual doing pull-ups at a reasonable acceleration. Regardless, this bar is probably fine if you are a person of lighter or average stature ~200 lbs or less.

4831,iron gym total upper body workout bar,19.99,Works but over time foam may break down and stain,3.0 ,"This review is after a very long time frame of having the product. I purchased it nearly 6 years ago so can attest to durability as well as any issues that may have surfaced after such an extended period. Likes It does what it should. You easily put it on the door with no screwing or other installations and it just works. The bar is reasonably padded and doubling as a pushup bar is a nice bonus. So to put it short, it does what it does. Dislikes This wasn't an initial problem but surfaced over the course of 5 years and that is the foam itself. It has broken apart in a couple places. What has happened is that the force when you do a pullup is transferred almost entirely to the foam pieces along the long bar as they are pushed into the door molding. This causes the foam to compress over time and eventually break down. The plastic in mine has pushed through the foam and is now in directly contact with the door. I would say this happened around year 2 or 3 of owning the product. Secondly the foam itself stains the doors. There are black marks that can not be removed on our white door trim pieces without painting them over. The movement caused by the compressed foam has actually worn right through the paint on the door moldings. The product is still usable as the foam on the parts in contact with my hands are still fine. Conclusion So yes it works but not without a drawback that if you value the appearance of our door moldings may be big enough to look elsewhere. I can't speak to whether newer versions use different materials but to me the parts that have direct contact with the molding should be made out of a different material. I went back and forth between a 3 and 4 star but settled on 3 because its advertised as a door hanging pull up bar and if it can't perform in the one environment it was meant for it shouldn't be rewarded.",,,21 Dec 2015

4833,iron gym total upper body workout bar,19.99,Too small for my door frames. While multiple reviews ...,2.0 ,"Too small for my door frames. While multiple reviews (and the user manual) warn that this is only suited for doors up to 32"" wide (there's some extension bar you can order for wider doors) none mentioned that large door frames will also prevent installation. My smallest door frames are about 6"" wide and I think the unit can just barely be snugly installed at that width. It's not even close to possible on my larger, 7"" wide door frames. The height of the door frame's top bar also matters. From the flat surface on top of the frame where the unit will rest while installed to the bottom of the top bar (the edge the top of the door clears) is about 6"" vertical inches on my smallest frame. This matches the size of the unit so closely that it took some creativity to get the ""safety wedge"" installed between the unit and my door frame. This is again with a door frame 6"" wide, and may have a bit of slack for slimmer frames. My wider 8"" frames not only were too wide to accommodate the unit but also made it clear that 6"" vertical height for the top bar of the frame couldn't possibly be cleared, even though 6"" is just barely possible on my slimmer 6"" wide frame. A final consideration is that the bar and your pull ups will be on the no-hinge, no-door side of the frame. All together this purchase will probably have to be returned and this could have been avoided if these limitations were more clearly posted.",,,19 Nov 2015

Does the bar go under or over? We figured it out by going online, but why should that even be necessary? Most importantly - the material is AWFUL! It bends, and flexes (and makes noise when it does!), and I'm scared to put all of my weight on it. Which actually makes this a useless product. I am really scared that it won't hold, especially with how bad it flexes - when you aren't even off the ground yet! Very scary - and when I'm worried about my safety I can't focus on my workout.

It said two m6*50mm screws and two m6*45mm screws were included without reference to which was which, so I can see some poor soul having trouble telling the difference between the two (seeing as how the length differed by a mere 5mm, less than 1/5 of an inch).

First, the non slip rubberized feet were loose and kept popping out of their place, the screws that came with it didn't match the screws in the instructions manual, the paint on the bar chipped easily before I even had a chance to use it. I thought it wasn't a big deal. Then I came across a review on Amazon and saw the review by someone who also received also received a counterfeit iron gym pull-up bar. My pull up bar looked just like the fake one in that review. One red flag is that it doesn't have the ""TM"" logo ANYWHERE it just says ""Iron Gym"". The only difference between my fake bar and their fake bar, was that mine didn't come in a white box, it came in a colored box, and my instructions manual was in b&w, theirs was in color. Through a quick google search(which I should've done in the beginning) I found Iron Gyms official website based in Europe and saw that they are aware of counterfeit pull up bars being sold with their name. To avoid fakes they advise you to buy from an authorized dealer. I immediately returned mine. I didn't bother getting a full refund, and lost $10 total(I have Amazon prime if anyone is wondering). If you decide to keep your counterfeit pull up bar, beware it will most likely bend in the middle. I saw a picture of a bent one(through another quick google search -_-) and Iron Gym commented saying they could easily tell that bar was a fake. I now have one I bought directly through their official website. The instructions are in color, the padded bar has their logo with ""TM"" next to it, also another logo that says ""PRO FIT (TM)"", the tools are exactly like the ones pictured in the instruction manual, it didn't chip at all while putting it together, doesn't feel flimsy, it feels SOLID, it came with free ab straps and a ""workout wall chart"".

5046,iron gym total upper body workout bar,19.99,Chin Up,5.0 ,"One of my resolutions for this year is to be able to do consecutive chin ups. This bar is going to get me there. I’ll update in January 2019. In the meantime, this piece of fitness equipment is easy to build, install, and use making regular practice an attainable goal. It’s also a great price. Word of advice: Make sure the top frame of your door (also called casing, lentil or header) is not more than 3.5” tall or this unit will not fit. If you have decorative molding or a cornice on top of the frame (see pic), it will not fit no matter the size (the molding will prevent a strong purchase between the wall and the bar.) Our vintage home has these types of moldings throughout except in the renovated third floor space with 2.5” door frames with doors. With or without the metal clip, you can remove the bar to close the door as well as to use the unit for floor exercises like pushups. We bought a folding step stool so that our tween son can reach the bar without jumping up. That kind of motion will definitely dislodge the unit leading to injury. The bar is listed for up to 300 pounds. Our individual weights are half of that, but I do not allow the boys to use this without an adult spotter. If you use this bar with care and caution - especially when used by kids - this pull-up bar may be a good addition to your in-home gym.",,,05 Apr 2018

I needed something to put in my door way so that I could use an autistic swing for my kids, as well as other things for my ADHD child to climb up. So I got this and since the bars are a little to wide for swings to be attached to it. So I used Ankle Straps for Cable Machines that had 2 metal hoops on it to make the swing be able to hook to the pull up bar. We also use a child's climb rope which nicely hangs their as well and has never budged from the area where it rests on. It was easy to put together, and since the weight limit is 300 I feel 100% safe that my kids and their toys that are on there will not come down. It is very sturdy and I am not going to lie at first I put all my weight on while it was on the doorway there just to make sure the molding wasn't going to come down (just because I am paranoid about things like that when evolving kids) and it has never budged once, I weigh about 200 pounds.

5190,iron gym total upper body workout bar,19.99,"Good pull-up bar, but certain precautions necessary",4.0 ,"I purchased this in August of 2015 and it has served its purpose well. Assembly was easy. If I remember correctly, it took me less than 30 minutes. I don’t use it for anything else other than pull ups and chin-ups, but I’m sure it’ll be good for pushups and sit-ups. I question how effective dips would be on this since it seems a bit too low to do a full movement dip. It has handled my weight (145 lbs) well and has not started to bend or sag. I do have a couple of complaints, the padding on the bar where it meets the door frame should be thicker. Mine degraded without me noticing and the actual solid bar started to push against my doorframe. Now my doorframe is damaged. I recommend putting a sock between the doorframe and the bar to provide more padding for protection. My other complaint is that the flat piece that goes against the wall above the doorframe could discolor your wall. It did mine. I recommend putting something in between the wall and the flat plastic part to prevent against this. Other than that, this is a well built product that performs as advertised.",,,21 Jan 2018

I increased muscle mass, lost weight, and was even able to tone some pre-existing muscles. Since I’ve bought this product I have lost a majority of my gynecomastia, gained 2-3 inches on my biceps, toned all my upper body muscles, and even set a path for a six pack! After using this bar I can confidently say that I have increased my max amount of pull-ups from 0 to 20 comfortably.

It's also portable and easy to store. Some folks leave their bar up at all times, but I have my girlfriend in the house and I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate the vibe of a pull up bar in front of the bedroom.

5422,iron gym total upper body workout bar,19.99,Great Bang For the Buck Fitness Value,5.0 ,"In terms of bang for the buck, this is one of the best fitness values on the market. I'm about 175 lbs. and the bar supports me comfortably without any problem. It affixes sturdily to most door frames. Just measure your door before purchasing to ensure it fits. It only takes minutes to put together and so far, it has made no marks on the wall or door frame. I was initially skeptical, but the leverage concept behind the design works great. Pull-ups are one of the most under-rated exercises to build strength and your physique. You truly do not need to do anything more than pull-ups, pushups, squats and sit-ups/ab work to get in great shape. Add in cardio and you're set. I have not belonged to a gym in years and I think I might be in my best shape since my youth. Final bit of advice. Take it slow with pull-ups. Find a simple program that has you building up slowly over time. Don't be discouraged if you can't do any to start. Be patient - It may take some time. There may be some workouts initially where if you squeeze out one or two pull-ups that's a victory. Pull-ups are HARD. But don't give up and stay with it, you will be rewarded.",,,02 Aug 2017

The molding above my doors is 1"" thick/4.25"" and that's too high--it appears this product was designed for smaller molding. The top horizontal bar must rest *on top of the molding*; otherwise, it won't stay up when you're pulling up on it (while a lot of your weight will be redirected into the door frame, there's still a downward vector which the molding above the door absorbs). The photo demonstrates how the unit hangs, and I'm about 0.25"" shy of fitting. Sigh. Also, this product probably won't work on anything other than flat molding: the top bar is only 0.75"" and probably doesn't provide enough offset for decorative moldings, which would probably get crushed. These size limitations aren't on Amazon's web site or in the manual, which I read before unpacked the product; this is clearly a vendor miss. Other products from this vendor note a molding size restriction of 3.5"". Update: vendor contacted me and offered a completely satisfactory solution, so I'm boosting my rating.

Upon opening the filter cartridge area, the paper towel I used to pad the cartridge is now soaked. Redid papertowel (little thicker) and when I went back to check on it a couple hours later, paper towel getting wet again. Just submitted a refund request. Will try to buy from a brick/mortar store to see if I have better luck or even try to find an alternate option. Will see what works! 12 March Update: bought again but had issues when I installed it. I’d get a hammering noise and then no water would flow. Searched high and low for the ‘how to fix’ and found it on a YouTube video. The latest cartridge I received was ever so slightly smaller than the last one, so it was making a complete seal when the filter compartment lid was closed. So upon advice from the YouTube video I put in a folded piece of paper towel (about 1/4 sheet folded up) btwn cartridge and door and Voila - it worked w/out issued! No hammering noise and water flows freely. Will update again if this changes anytime soon!",,,18 Nov 2017

I was hoping to find a water filter branded by either Whirlpool/Amanda or at least the same brand as the filter they've already installed in my fridge. This product was bought because our old filter reached its 6-month limit and after a few months of use, the water change taste. We had no choice but to but a new one and luckily we found this filter which was compatible. After installing, you have to throw out some of the water and ice from the fridge as instructed in the manual. To install, there is this square compartment on the bottom of the fridge (outside).

We had a power outage for several hours. And when the power came back on, the indicator light was green again. This seems incredibly scummy to me. This indicates that the fridge doesn't have a ""real"" way to determine whether a filter is in good shape- it possibly only goes by how long it has been in the fridge or how much water it has already filtered (and I'm not even sure it would be possible for the filter or fridge to keep track of how much water it has filtered.) If my filter was really ""bad"" my indicator light should still be yellow. So take that as you will. The actual water is delicious, no complaints there. The only reason I deducted those stars is because of what seems like an obvious money grubbing ploy. Make people believe that the filter is going bad so they buy an overpriced filter.

Competition pushed the profit margins on appliances way down, and this is how they are making it up on the consumer, many times over. If my refrigerator lasts 10 years with no other maintenance, I will have spent quite a bit more in filters alone that I paid for the appliance itself. I will give props to amazon, they do have the best price around on this filter, and I checked everywhere. All in all, it's such a great scam, I wish I had thought of it.

5791,everydrop by whirlpool refrigerator water filter 1 (pack of 1),47.84,If you are wondering why your water tastes bad it may not be the filter.,3.0 ,"I purchase a new Whirlpool French Door Fridge earlier this month. After running 4 gallons through, and dumping the first few batches of ice the water was funky. The water had a bad chemical plastic taste that did not diminish with additional flushing. I read several reviews on the previous generation filter (same as my new fridge) with the same complaint. I was ready to send the fridge back. I did a little information gathering on appliance repair sites and discovered source of the problem and occam's razor came to mind. It was the new steel braided ice maker supply line (mine was a Watts brand made in China) I bought it new for the fridge. Read reviews of various ice maker supply lines and you will see there is a serious problem with many manufacturers. Anyway I ordered a Whirlpool 8212547RP 5-Feet Pex Ice Maker Hook-up Kit from Amazon for about 8 bucks with tax (same material as the rest of the fridge's plumbing) and the water tastes fine now. I replaced my original filter just because I considered the original to be contaminated. The new filter tastes fine, although I am docking stars for the high price, although I imagine that it will come down in price as its a new product with limited supply at the moment. If you are suffering from that chemical taste: unless you have a copper, pex or a quality confirmed ice make supply line then you owe it to yourself to at least test it. Pull your fridge out, turn the supply valve off, disconnect the supply line from the fridge. Fill a glass with water directly from the supply line and taste it. If it tastes worse than tap then you know its the ice maker supply line. I honestly wonder about the economics of how many refrigerators and filters have been returned because the ice maker supply line is of poor quality.",,,30 Jul 2015

6204,everydrop by whirlpool refrigerator water filter 1 (pack of 1),47.84,"Four Different Filters, None Work",4.0 ,"UPDATE: I am revising my review because I was incorrect with my conclusions. I finally got a technician to look at my problem and he said that it something he has seen before and it is air in the water line. His only advice was to keep working at it until the air is gone. I gave up after a while and just removed the fiter entirely. My model fridge does not require a plug. I'm somewhat annoyed with Whirlpool support; I can't be the only person to have had this problem. I've tried four different filters with no success. With three of the filters, there was a loud hammering sound that persisted and sounded like it could damage the fridge. With this last purchase, there is a brief hammering noice then no water comes out of the dispenser, just a drop or two no matter how long I try. When I put the old filter back in, the water flows with no problem. Unfortunately, I let the return window close so I am stuck with it. I should add that I chatted with Whirlpool support. Apparently they have no history of this sort of problem. Their suggestion was to try another filter --which I did-- and if that didn't work --it didn't-- place a service call. They also recommended that I check if my model fridge is still eligible for their service plan. If I place a one-time service call for this problem then I become ineligible for their service plan. Either way, it sounds expensive. I am at a loss as to how to get a replacement filter. Has anyone had luck with off-brand, non-Whirlpool filters.",,,09 Jun 2017

6411,uvex skyper blue light blocking computer glasses with sct-orange lens (s1933x),8.49,"Meh... You could do worse, You could do better,",2.0 ,"These glasses do block blue light. The lenses are so dark, they block almost any color of light. I bought these at first for the price. After a few months, my children had gotten to them, cracked the lens (it is a single piece) right down the middle. Later they got to the ear pieces and that was the end of them. I felt that even on the brightest of screens these blocked too much to clearly see, and though the adjustable ear pieces were a nifty feature; all in all they felt more like outdoor construction glasses than anything else. Manufacturing: Cheap plastic. Seriously, they feel like a set of the cheapest Wal-Mart safety glasses. Feel: Uncomfortable to wear, the nose pieces are indelicate and will start to hurt after a while. To see out of them is difficult, and I felt like every time I put them away was the last time I would see them in one piece. Performance: They block light, are slightly oversized so you don't have to worry about fit, and the adjustable ear pieces with the wrap-around side blocking were useful features. However, I feel that being so fragile cancels the usefulness of these features out. Also, I found it difficult to see out of them, so much so that I found myself frequently removing them to get a better look at my screen. Conclusion: If you really have to be below $10 for blue blocking glasses, go ahead and purchase them. They block more blue light than any of the other three brands I have tried, which are Shileded, Beison and Gunnar Optiks. You won't get a headache from blue light when you are wearing these unless you are in the unlikely position of being more sensitive to light and prone to migraines as I am. Personally, I recommend you spend a few extra bucks and look for another brand. When the lens broke, I took a butane lighter and melted the crack together. It held for a few days, maybe a couple weeks, but eventually it gave out. Soon after, the earpiece went missing and now they are surely in the city dump.",,,14 Sep 2017

6444,uvex skyper blue light blocking computer glasses with sct-orange lens (s1933x),8.49,Disappointed ... or misunderstanding what these glasses & Blue Light really is,2.0 ,"Perhaps I am misunderstanding Blue Light but after doing some research from several websites (i.e.:, (allaboutvision /cvs/blue-light) (reviewofoptometry /ce/the-lowdown-on-blue-light-good-vs-bad-and-its-connection-to-amd) (preventblindness.org/blue-light-and-your-eyes) I felt I had a pretty good idea of what to expect in a pair of Blue Light blocking glasses. Blue light is on the lower spectrum of visible light, not quite in the UV (UltraViolet) but close. Please correct me if I'm wrong; being visible light, true blue light blocking lenses would leave you seeing a black or dark grey where the blue light should be. This is a bit of a problem surfing the web as the links to other websites, normally blue, would be grey or black & be difficult to easily recognize without hovering the mouse over the link. From my research, these are not blue light blocking glasses. Every piece of blue on a computer screen, on an electronic led light, on a pair of bluejeans in the sunlight comes through these glasses as blue. The purpose for two stars is the disappointment in the advertising name of ""Uvex Skyper Blue Light Blocking Computer glasses"" when these are clearly not blue light blocking glasses. My intention was to purchase blue light blocking glasses. However, I do give them two stars because first, they are Uvex which means quality & secondly, they can still be used as a decent pair of safety glasses when trimming trees & shrubs, cutting lumber, etc.",,,18 Jul 2017

I really, really, hate the style though. I feel ridiculous with them on. TOO SMALL: When I opened the box, I thought I received kid's glasses because the sides were so short. They are adjustable, but I was afraid I was going to break them in the process. They don't fit over my prescription glasses, which isn't a big deal because I'm nearsighted. However, if you are far sighted this could be a problem for you. TOO DARK: Perhaps they block blue light but so do my eyelids. I feel I'm wearing sunglasses in the house. The color is too dark and very distracting. I can't imagine editing photos with these on or doing anything else where color is important. BOTTOM LINE: I wish I could return these but I've already thrown away the packing. I offered them to my husband but even he didn't want them and made a joke about me looking like a welder. :) I guess my kids will get them for play glasses.",,,10 Jul 2017

It takes some force to fit these over my glasses, which are small and rimless and because of the poor fit over my perscription glasses, they do not fit up against my forehead or to the sides of my face. So they do not block the blue light from the top or sides. Another disappointment is how these glasses alter the color of almost everything. I was expecting them to just block the blue light, not to alter my entire color spectrum. So I ended up giving these glasses away, I cannot wear them.

So I wiped them off very gently, but they kept on steaming up. The over-all problem with the glasses is that they appear to be durable industrial grade glasses, when in fact they are very fragile. Another thing is that they are somewhat uncomfortable to where.

Effective at blocking blue light, but blurriness outweighs the good",2.0 ,"These glasses make text (on both books and computer/phone screens) look blurry, rendering them worthless. I have a laptop with exceptionally high resolution, constrast and definition (a MacBook Pro with retina display), which makes even small text look clear and sharp. I'm also near-sighted, and when I take out my contact lenses at night I can see extremely well at close range (about 2cm to 30 cm). But when I put on these glasses, everything's a blur. The blurriness is very disappointing, because the glasses do a wonderful job at screening out blue light, and I found that the change in light did indeed help with my insomnia. Having encountered a number of products that seem to be based on scientific principles that make sense, but then nevertheless fail to work, I was skeptical about whether blocking blue light would actually be effective. Perhaps it was placebo effect, but I found that putting on these glasses made the light look as if it was just at sunset, and immediately gave me the relaxed feeling of sitting and reading on a back porch on a summer evening. And instead of feeling WIDE awake, energetic and motivated to get things done 'til 6:00AM, the relaxed feeling soon turned to sleepiness, and I'd fall asleep by 11:30PM to midnight. That was wonderful (and, whether placebo effect or not, I'd take it), but the blurriness had me craning my neck forward and squinting my eyes in order to read text. I found this too unpleasant -- neck pain, eye-muscle fatigue -- to continue using the glasses. I'm giving the product two stars only because it fulfilled its primary claim of blocking blue light, but arguably it deserves only one star because the blurriness rendered it useless to me.

You'd think I'd stop watching TV before bed, but NOPE! I happen to be reading some random blog one day and saw the writer recommend these glasses for those who watch TV or use their cell phones at night. I figured for $9 what was there to lose. I noticed a difference on the very first night! I was falling asleep 5-10 minutes into my show which NEVER happened. I can't even tell you the amount of times I've fallen asleep with these glasses on...that's how comfortable they are. They are flexible and appear to be made with soft rubber that bend with the shape of your head. If I fall asleep I don't feel a hard piece of plastic sticking into my skin. It's almost as comfortable as a sleep mask, but also very durable. They're in the same shape they were when I bought them two years ago.

6860,uvex skyper blue light blocking computer glasses with sct-orange lens (s1933x),8.49,You really do need blue light protection. This is an inexpensive way to get it.,5.0 ,"I got these glasses for my grandchildren. They spend a lot of time on the computer and I'm afraid of the cumulative damage of computer use, TV watching, tablet use, and whatever other blue-light producing products they engage in. If I can cut down on some of the blue-light damage, this is a cost effective and practical way to do it. It fits my 9-year old grandson perfectly but is a bit loose on the 5-year old (who still uses it because it looks cool).They have no graduation. For me, I've been using another blue-light set of glasses that has the +1.50 graduation I need for my vision on computer screens. My ophthalmologist told me it was a great idea and he highly recommended the protection. Basically, you figure the graduation you may need by ordering a level that is half your reading glasses strength. So, since my reading glasses are +3.00.I halved it and got the +1.50 which works perfectly. Does it affect colors? Yes, especially the first few minutes. After that, you forget they're there. If you use your computer for processing photos or designing graphics etc, you might need to, occasionally, lift the glasses up to make sure you're not over-yellowing. But for video watching, computer games, and office documents (Word, Excel, etc) it really doesn't interfere.",,,25 Feb 2018

I was expecting it to be way too large but, they are okay. They do slide down off my face a bit but, I guess I could place a shim on the bottom of the lenses where it touches my face to help keep them up...or use some sort of tie to fasten it to my head. I wear this 2 hours before I go to sleep. It's been only a week so, I don't notice a measurable difference. I'm still getting used to watching a movie without any blues and brushing my teeth with these googles on. After two hours, I'm glad to be able to take them off mostly because they are large and I'm just not used to them. I use a computer for hours but I would not use these to play video games or on the computer. Try blue blocking glasses that aren't as yellow. You'll still get some benefit and not blow out all the blues. I'm glad I tried this product.

In an online, two image comparison graphic for testing the effectiveness of blue blocking lenses, both images appear identical when I'm wearing the glasses. They are very comfortable on my small, woman's head, have adjustable temples and fit very close to my face all the way around. The nose bridge on these glasses is molded into the lens and is not quite as comfortable as Smith & Wesson Magnum 3G glasses which have a silicone (?) nose piece but it does interfere less with vision. The lenses wrap around giving good side protection from blue light. These are very nice, inexpensive blue blockers.

I had just about given up when I read an article about success in blocking blue light in the hours before bedtime. I took a chance and bought these which were featured in the article. And, WOW!!! It sounds crazy but these glasses have changed my life. The first night I wore them I slept like a baby! After 3 nights of great sleep, I tested the product by not wearing the glasses. And...back to the insomnia. :-( So, now I've set an alarm on my phone to remind me to put them on at 8:30p every night. By 10:30p, I'm falling asleep whether I want to or not! I've even woken up in the glasses because I fell asleep so soundly wearing them. Seriously, if you have insomnia, BUY THESE! They aren't cute and you may feel silly wearing them.

7020,uvex skyper blue light blocking computer glasses with sct-orange lens (s1933x),8.49,Sleeping well and waking happy! My chronic sleep problems have been resolved!,5.0 ,"I can sleep at last! These orange Uvex Skyper glasses worn every evening - in combination with the Luminette Bright Light Theraply Glasses worn every morning - have totally transformed my life! Prior to buying these two items my sleep cycle had been appallingly since uni days. Years of working on a laptop all night in a brightly lit office had ruined my body's ability to regulate its sleep. I'd be bursting with energy at midnight, and then still powering away at dawn. It was easy to stay awake for 36 hours at time, but almost impossible to sleep. Mornings were just awful, and I'd feel lacklustre all day ... until about 7pm when my energy levels would begin to rise again. Over the years I had often tried to reform my sleep, but without any success; clearly, my brain was simply not producing melatonin. A few months ago I decided to start an experiment to see if cutting out blue light at night, and then adding bright blue light in the mornings, could overcome the chronic sleep problems. The science seemed valid, so I hoped it would work on me. I bought both the Uvex Skyper orange glasses (to block blue light in the evenings) and the Luminette glasses (to simulate bright daylight in the mornings) and used both diligently every day as part of a program to reform my sleep. Here's what I experienced. 1. Within a couple of weeks of wearing the Uvex Skyper glasses I started getting sleepy at around 11pm, like normal people do!! 2. After just a few mornings of wearing the Luminette glasses I began to enjoy waking up. I couldn't wait to pop on my ""happy glasses"" as they made me feel wonderful! Now, more than 2 months later, I wake every morning around 7am feeling bright and cheerful. 3. The quality of my sleep has been completely transformed. Only three months ago I would wake every half hour and then lie awake for another two or three hours; now I sleep soundly the whole night through! Based upon my experience, here are the key conclusions I'd to share with others. * If an inability to wind down or fall asleep is your main problem, then the orange Uvex Skyper glasses (around $9) should be your first purchase - because if you can kick-start your melatonin production at night, then you will sleep better and wake happier. * However, if you struggle to wake up and you feel sluggish for hours afterwards, then the Luminette glasses could be transformational for you (as they were for me). I used to hate mornings ... and now I love them! * You still need to be sufficiently self disciplined to use the specs diligently. E.g. if I forget to wear the orange glasses for a few nights, then my old habit of staying awake all night quickly returns. I'm writing this review jointly for the Uvex Skyper Blue Light Blocking Glasses (for evenings) and the Luminette 2 SAD Bright Light Therapy Glasses (for mornings) because I used both over the same time period and it isn't really possible to tell which of them has contributed most to resolving my sleep and wake problems.",,,17 Oct 2017

I have read that exposing yourself to blue light at night can keep you awake. This seems to be a scientifically based fact. While ideally I would completely stop looking at a screen at night, these are my go-to when I can't resist. I read that these shades block a very high percentage of blue light. Pros: they block a large amount of blue light. They are substantially less expensive than competing fashion frames that block a fraction of the blue light. Cons: Not office-attractive, but I only wear them at home. Only good for reading or other black and white work; designers up all night working who need full color and no distortion can't use any yellow lens, especially such intense ones as these. In sum, if you can't break your reading on-scren at night habit, these should help reduce the insomnia that can result.",,,09 Sep 2017

After LASIK I decided to try out some glasses that block UV for work, since I no longer need my prescription lenses which had that protection. 1. They are chunky, but adjustable unless you have a tiny head like mine, in which case the ability to rotate them is more important than the ability to lengthen the arms. 2. The nose piece holds them well, but someone with a slight, never-broken nose might consider additional pads. 3. It blocks blue light. Our phone lights are blue plastic over white bulbs, and they look unlit with these on. 4. Greens look amazing, but if you need color differentiation visually, you'll either have to learn how the new colors look or go a less full route. 5. Normally looking at a computer screen leaves an after image when I close my eyes, or sometimes with them open. With these glasses there is either no after image or it fades in 1-2 seconds. 6. The design also blocks my desk fans from drying out my eyes, which is a nice bonus. Overall I have found this pair to block the most long blue light (visually, not as measured with a specific tool), and the reduction in after-images is a pleasant surprise.

7082,uvex skyper blue light blocking computer glasses with sct-orange lens (s1933x),8.49,It does change the colors pretty dramatically when you first put them on,4.0 ,"I use these primarily to reduce blue light to aid my sleep quality. When I used the online blue light blocking test (where you compare two different color patterns) it seems to block out most of the blue light. So kudos from the blue light blocking perspective. It does change the colors pretty dramatically when you first put them on, but your eyes will adjust slightly and the picture (on your tv, etc) will look more acceptable over time (but of course, will not be nearly as good when watching without these!). The lenses are cheap plastic, but what do you expect for under $10? My primary issue is that these are huge and do not fit my face well. I have a low nose bridge and high cheekbones, so these sit on my cheekbones. As such these are not as comfortable as glasses that rest on my nose bridge, and I can see the bridge on the glasses when wearing them. Because of the poor fit, I tried another pair of ""computer glasses"" on Amazon. Although the other glasses had a slight yellow tint, when I tried the online test it appeared to not block much of the blue light so I returned them. If anyone has a recommendation on another brand of glasses that blocks most of the blue light please let me know! I may try the other UVEX glasses (S0360X) but my guess is these will not fit my face very well either.",,,21 Aug 2017

I tried some more expensive (about $30) glasses meant for gamers and they didn't block enough blue light. These do! I've even had middle of the night times when I couldn't sleep and these do the trick. My only caution is I wear wire-framed glasses and the curve on these can bend the frames a bit changing their focus. As a result I wear the Uvex glasses without my prescription glasses which means I miss most things printed on the t.v. screen, but the way this helps me at bedtime is worth it.

Visibility through the lenses has remained mostly unchanged & I expect them to last out the season and be replaced for next spring.

Put a pair on for 5 minutes and watch tv, stare at your phone, or work on your laptop, and if you slip them off you'll be amazed at how blinding that light suddenly feels. We just don't notice it because our eyes adjust. The Uvex glasses demonstrate just how bright it actually is. I purchased these because they appear to block more blue light than the other available options. While many competing products on here claim to block blue light, they ultimately have come up short in tests done by reviewers. These didn't. However, while the competitors may not effectively block blue light, at least they look somewhat normal. These look ridiculous. They are obviously designed as safety goggles for working with power tools and have been repurposed to satisfy the blue light crazed crowd. And that's fine with me, because they do the job well. But the idea of wearing these out of the house or at my job (which does not require any power tool beyond a computer) is laughable. My girlfriend still giggles every time I put them on, and, frankly, I don't blame her and thank her every time for not immediately leaving me. But, if you can get around all of that, for the price of these they really do seem to give your eyes a break. So put them on 30 minutes before you go to bed and let the scientists worry about whether it actually does anything to your melatonin production or not. It won't matter, because you'll definitely feel better.",,,27 Jul 2017

They offer limited protection against sun glare or other light sources and should not be used for welding, brazing or cutting operations. There is a good deal more... And when I put them on during the day and looked at the computer, the glare from the window bothered me, where I had not noticed it without any glasses on. I was not able to see the color blue as blue. It appeared more black or grey. You would not be able to wear them over glasses. As for the ratcheting system on the legs of the glasses.

This holds the cards at an angle relative to frame and is extremely ugly. The frame also doesn't sit flat on the desk surface -- it wobbles due to the weird angle on which it was bent. Even the ""Rolodex"" sign was glued on at a crooked angle relative to the mesh frame. These are of the lowest quality I have seen.

Didn't anyone try to put some Post Its in the bin when they made the prototype? Prototype, ah no. Likely this was designed on a computer, and the bin was specified to be 3 inches wide, but the material width wasn't taken into consideration so the bin turned out too small.

However, when I got, the thing was HUGE! There was no way it could fit in my desk drawer, let alone any desk drawer. It was wide and extremely deep.

7522,"rolodex deep desk drawer organizer, metal mesh, black (22131)",10.99,Not the best solution out there,2.0 ,"This is a medium guage metal pen / pencil / desk organizer with a bin that can be removed, though it does take some fidgeting to get it out. I think the middle section of this unit could have been designed better, the bin takes up too much space and does not slide out well at all. This leaves less room for pens and pencils and the top sections are an odd size. If you need the big drawer then all is well, but I cannot think of anything but post-it notes to go in there and who needs that many? The pen / pencil sections are too wide and too shallow so that pens and pencils just kind of flop around and this looks messy on a desk. I brought this to replace the age old mug solution and this has the same overall appearance of something put to uses other than what it was intended to do. The separate sections of this are welded together and they are not very even joins so it rocks a bit and looks kind of sloppy up close. On the front right of the unit, there is a RoloDex logo and the one I have is very crooked. The logo is stamped into the metal screening so it cannot be fixed and it just makes the whole thing look a bit shabby. For the money I expected something a little more refined than this unit.",,,26 Mar 2010

It designed provide a lot of space to place daily office supply in it and still have room for more. However, there are two flaws that I noticed and buyer should look out for: 1. The caddy's sheets of metal are not welded together, instead solder at both ends of the conjoining sheets. I have no fear of the caddy falling apart one day, but it's poor craftsmanship and attention to details that cause the product to lose value. 2. For detail-oriented individual, because the caddy's sheets of metal are solder, the walls are aligned 100% neatly next to each other. I have 2 of caddies (because one came without a tray and I had to get a free replacement) and one of them have a gap in the back of the caddy because the sheets of metal aren't aligned properly. Overall, I still recommend on buying this product. For the price-to-quality ratio, this product is best on the market as of right now. You honestly can't go wrong with this product. Buy it! I guarantee you would be happy with what you get.",,,16 Jul 2017

For instance...I use ""-"" dash...alot....I would be nice to have that saved as a 1st option with symbols instead of needing to hit the right arrow 15 times.

I could not see a way to adjust the marginal space at the start and end of printing. I don't want white tails off my labels, so I just cut them off. This means I am wasting a lot of label tape that I don't need to - and other models I have used at work allow you to reduce the margin space. I think this machine was designed to have too much margin in order to run out of label tape faster and have to buy more sooner.

The quality of the labels is good, it doesn't waste a TON of material, (though it could be less) and the app interface is good. The reason I'm deducting stars is that I had to repair the battery, which seems like a common issue with this product, based on the other reviews that I've read. I used it for about a year, then packed it away for another year. When I took it out of storage, I got a low battery error when trying print, even after letting the battery charge for hours. I removed the battery pack from the printer, and split the case halves apart with a utility knife. There are two 14430 (4/5AA) LiIon cells inside. With a hobby battery charger, I attempted to discharge and charge the battery cells. They were completely dead. I purchased replacement cells here on Amazon, (http://a.co/9VkSnFR) and soldered everything back together. The printer's working great again, but unless you're good at soldering and enjoy tinkering, be aware that you'll probably have to buy a new battery pack, or repair the pack at some point.

This PnP device was in no way PnP. I followed the quick start instructions, but when it was supposed to get underway, it just did nothing. After much trial and error and online research, I found out that installing an older version of Dymo software (8.5.2) would allow it to recognize the printer. At that point, I was able to get it to print...but only black text on my white label cartridge. I tried printing on my black label cartridge, and it wouldn't work (even though I changed the text color to white). I used to print fine with white on black on my older 280 device. So with the printer at least (partially) working on the 8.5.2 software, I upgraded to the latest 8.7 software, to see if that might help, but then the printer wasn't recognized, as the earlier article pointed out.

8267,dymo labelmanager 280 rechargeable hand-held label maker (1815990),29.77,Nice form factor but too many issues to get as a primary labeler,2.0 ,"This dymo works for printing labels but has a few issues that make it a pain to work with. The keypad on this unit is very mushy and not the easiest to use. Due to the mushiness, it will take some time to write in the label text. The power button also tends not to work well and requires a fairly aggressive press to get it started. Another issue with this unit is the labels tend to get jammed while being printed. The way the labels exit the unit there are a few thin plastic openings in the feed path which can easily catch the tape that is being printed causing it to get jammed up and require opening to unit to fix. This happened on the first print from the unit and still happens every so often. The last issue is the unit fails to work with rechargable batteries. NiMH, which have a lower voltage than alkaline will seem to work in the unit but if you try to print the motors seem to operate slower which causes it to feed the tape only a fraction of the required amount to properly function. This shows a poor design that depends on a strong battery voltage to drive the motor to the appropriate speed instead of using a regulator to fix the issue and allow the use of rechargables.",,,16 Nov 2017

The first one I received was faulty, it did not print at all, though did make noises like it was trying to. I attempted to use two different sets of tape and neither worked. So I switched it for a new one of the same thing through Amazon. This one I just received, and while it does print now, the largest size lettering (which is what I wanted to use) prints extremely poorly, with lots of uneven-ness as if it's running out of ink. Also tried two different sets of tape on this device, both did not print correctly. Images attached include prints from both tapes at pt.24 font size. At pt.20 font size the printer will print decently, still not perfect, but it's at least easily legible and doesn't look like complete garbage. So I will probably keep this one just to print what I need and never use it again.

8366,dymo labelmanager 280 rechargeable hand-held label maker (1815990),29.77,Designed to waste label tape. Double check all settings first.,3.0 ,"There are some issues with this product. First, they made the display of the type size almost unreadable. Maybe that's so you don't notice that when you change colors of tape, the unit mysteriously resets just that one setting back to 8, so that you waste a label. Odd that it's the only setting it changes, and I didn't change tape sizes. Next, when you change tape, there is a stop placed in the tape loading chamber, that makes it feel like it's inserted all the way, when it isn't, so it also invariably jams or prints the first label crooked, wasting a label. If you check it by pushing hard on the cartridge, you will discover it snaps in again a second time. Next, on some size fonts, it leaves an unprinted stripe down the middle of the tape, wasting a label. Next, I read the questions and ratings, and someone had asked if it wasted label tape like the predecessor Dymo label maker by leaving big blank areas on both sides of the printing and the answer was no, but that was not my experience. It left a full half inch regardless of printing size. Finally, the keyboard is buggy. Sometimes you will hit a letter and it won't register, even though the keys have a definite input feedback so that you know you pressed them completely, other times it enters TWO letters instead of just one. SO you waste another label. So to me it seems like these issues are all designed into the product to waste label tape.",,,18 Sep 2017

I somehow didn't notice that this unit uses a proprietary rechargeable battery. I probably wouldn't have ordered it had I noticed. Something like this that may only get occasional use... using a rechargeable lithium battery is just asking for trouble. Trouble like discharging when idle in a desk drawer - I just found that the battery is down >30% after sitting for a couple weeks unused, having only been asked to print one 4""-wide label as a test prior to being stored. Trouble like chargers that disappear - mine already has, before I even managed to reach two uses, and I don't have an AC adapter handy that fits the jack, and even aftermarket replacements are barely less than the cost of the unit. Trouble like having to replace the battery module eventually, and I note that Dymo asks significantly more for the replacement battery than for the hardware itself. ...Which means that most users will just order a whole new unit, which translates to an awful lot of these ending up in landfills prematurely, and I guarantee this big hunk of plastic isn't biodegradable. None of this is great news. The other bad news: the adhesive on the D1 1/2"" tape is pretty weak (it won't hold on Ziploc freezer bags), and Dymo hasn't provided so much as a period key or slash on the keyboard; any punctuation mark is going to require at least three button presses, probably more while you select your punctuation mark from the punctuation menu. Did it ever occur to Dymo that people might often want to include, y'know, dates on their labels? I gambled on this vs. a Brother product. I'm frankly kind of sorry I did. EDIT: I posted this review on September 16, 2017. Two days later I found the power supply / charger. I labeled it clearly with the labelmaker - though the label barely stuck to that either - then charged up the unit fully (its second full charge since my receipt of the device the first week of September), and set it aside. Today, October 7, I picked up the labelmaker to print a label for the first time since its full charge on 9/18/17. It has been off and unused for 19 days. The unit powered up for 20 seconds, then flashed CHARGE BATTERY! and turned off. My 30-day return window ended 4 days ago. Do not buy this unit.

Even with a partially charged battery, you may get the message ""Wait x minutes Battery Charging"". It uses the same overpriced and nasty proprietary battery as the DYMO LabelManager PnP , and that unit is notorious for having the battery die if you frequently allow it to discharge. The first thing you'll want to do with this unit is print a label that says 'KEEP PLUGGED IN"" to remind you not to let the battery go flat. Short version: the power adapter is only for charging the battery. It cannot power it alone, so you need to keep this plugged in when you're not using it unless you like having to wait when you need a label. Still a very good label maker for the current price, hence 3 stars, but be aware that the product description on Amazon is wrong.

Turns out, this product is terrible. I bought this label maker in July 2016, used it a handful of times, charged it and boxed it up until next time. The next time that I opened the box - maybe 6 months later - it would not hold a charge at all. The icon wouldn't even blink when it was connected (the bars of the battery getting filled up), nothing, just dead. I ordered another one (the price was right and I thought I might have just gotten a lemon the first time around). New unit arrives, I plugged it in, but something was wrong almost immediately - the unit display would say ""charging, please wait X minutes"" and then I would look over a few seconds later, and it wouldn't be charging at all... We finally figured out that it is VERY finicky about how it is plugged in and ultimately gave up as it would require constant supervision while charging. As a result, I am returning the unit that showed up today and tossing my older (but identical) unit away. I even tried a multi-volt AC adapter to get it to charge, but it is just unresponsive.

8510,dymo labelmanager 280 rechargeable hand-held label maker (1815990),29.77,"Whitespace margins are HUGE, making the device almost unusable",1.0 ,"Summary: MINIMUM whitespace margins on a label are ~1"", unless you cut it to size yourself. It does print labels. In my case, I did need to install the (Mac) software, since I frequently need to print a non-Latin language, but I knew this beforehand; the SW itself is OK, although much more confusing than it should be. So why only 2 stars? 1) The labels are useless for labeling cables, which was one of the main reasons I got the device: a) When curved around a typical-thickness electronics cable, they don't stay stuck to it and peel off in less than a day; b) It's almost impossible to position the tape so it overlaps exactly on itself without leaving one-sided sticky surfaces. As soon as the two sticky sides touch, good luck on re-positioning. As a result, while the print quality itself is good, labels on cables still look messy and unprofessional. 2) The minimum label length is H-U-G-E. I want to label many small items (large-ish USB thumb drives, key tags, etc.). A typical label I'd want to make would be 8 12-point characters. This is a ~2.5cm (just under 1"") long text, but the minimum amount of white space around it comes to another 2.5cm, so 50% wastage. It's not just a matter of wasting material and added tape costs -- I virtually always need to cut labels with scissors by hand after printing simply to get labels small enough. This is both a hassle and makes for crooked-cut, messy result (yes, I'm not great with fine fingerwork -- if I were I wouldn't need a labelmaker in the first place and would just hand-cut sticky address labels). It's possible to at least eliminate the wastage by printing multiple labels at a time, but that doesn't solve the neat-cut problem. From my PoV, this ruins 90% of the purpose of the device, and I wouldn't have bought it had I known (and I bought this over a Brother-system label maker because of comments that this was much better in that respect).

8533,dymo labelmanager 280 rechargeable hand-held label maker (1815990),29.77,Its the handiest lil thing ever!,5.0 ,"So I've had this thing like...forever. What can I say? I hate doing reviews. *shrug* But I'm bored so here goes. Its the handiest lil thing ever! I try so hard to be organized and this label maker makes organizing so much more fun than what it should be. I like the many different font and function tools it has. Not too many that you need a doctorates degree in computer science to use it but enough to keep it fun and entertaining. The large keyboard and rubber buttons makes it easy to spell out anything rather quickly. The ink must be made of wizard blood because this stuff never dries up or runs out. The labeling tape lasts longer than expected, is cheap enough to replace without taking out a mortgage (like with your computer printer ink) and super easy to install a new cartridge. I managed it without having to call the customer service operator that doesn't speak English. Yay me! I like that I can buy different color tapes and in different sizes. I haven't done either but I like that I can... So what could I possibly complain about?... Well it can be a tiny bit tricky to get the paper off the back of the tape if you don't take a quick second to actually look at the back and just try to peel it from a corner. Hint: the paper, on the back that covers the sticky part, splits in the middle. So just fold the label width-wise a tiny bit and the paper will magically open up and you can quickly label that bagel ""Moms! Eat it and die!"" before the hungry lil buggers come and claim it for themselves. So if this thing ever breaks, you can bet your bottom that I will be ordering the exact same labeler again.",,,30 Apr 2018

Cannot adjust the amount of unused label before and after a word. Great print with enough options on handheld. I did not hook up to computer.

8614,dymo labelmanager 280 rechargeable hand-held label maker (1815990),29.77,Pleased with My LM160 Labelmaker,5.0 ,"Look close when you read the reviews here because it appears many different products are being covered. My review is for the DYMO LabelManager 160 Handheld Label Maker. I was looking for a basic label maker for an electronics project I’m working on mainly, and anything around the house where a label would be helpful. I paid a little more than I wanted to, but I figured I would buy it, use it for my project, then sell it. It’s kind of like renting a brand new device and then getting most of my money back. Anyway, it arrived quickly, I was pleased with the size and layout of the keyboard, and it was easy to begin using it. After inserting the blank roll of label tape I tried my first test label. The first label did not come out because it snagged inside label pathway. I saw it as my mistake for not threading the cartridge correctly on my first attempt. It really wasn’t complicated at all, just one of those little things that happened because I had never used it before. Opening the back again I was able to quickly fix the threading problem and start creating labels. I was now able to quickly type and print labels with ease, and no more jams. I like that the current label does not automatically get deleted after it prints. Sometimes I needed the same label like “On - Off” for several switches on my project board. Once the first label printed I pressed the cut icon then immediately pressed print again without having to retype. I’ve found in life you can pick apart pretty much anything, but I don’t feel this product is one of them. For the price I paid and the capability that it gives me I’m pleased with the LM 160.",,,09 Apr 2018

8669,dymo labelmanager 280 rechargeable hand-held label maker (1815990),29.77,How to fix “defective” units,4.0 ,"I have the Brother label printer at my workplace, and that unit is almost perfect except that it wastes a lot of tape with each printout. I bought this Dymo economy unit for occasional home use. It’s great that it doesn’t waste much tape. My only disappointment is that it comes with a caps lock button but no shift button. I consider myself part of the tech-savvy generation, who by default types quickly and professionally, and no Shift button is just an annoying handicap that clumsifies and slows down my label making experience. I guess that wouldn’t matter if you’re one of those people who always type in ALL-CAPS. Also, it seems about 10% of buyers (myself included) receive defective units where the drive motor won’t turn the tape spool. Before you return it, there’s a trick. If the unit sits on the shelf for years before getting sold, the motor bearings apparently seize up. All you have to do is remove the tape cartridge and unseize the motor by turning it a bit with your fingers. You will hear a mild pop sound and feel when the motor is unseized. My printer has been fine ever since.",,,25 Mar 2018

The adhesive feature is really nice and it doesn't stick to wood to the point where it won't come off; I can pull the labels off if need be, but they don't come off by themselves. I've only ever used this brand of label makers. My mom has an older model (about a decade old) and it still works.

8740,dymo labelmanager 280 rechargeable hand-held label maker (1815990),29.77,Maybe a bit too awesome...,5.0 ,"Well, now my whole world is labeled. The DYMO labeler makes it way too easy to label and organize. Buy it and you might get carried away. The reviewer who showed a photo of a cat with the label ""cat"" did not hyperbolize. I spent a day organizing and labeling bins in our storage room and now it's as orderly as a well-run library. And then I labeled the garage parts/hardware drawer organizer. And then the repurposed plastic spray bottles full of distilled water, bleach mixes, cleaners, etc. Limitless opportunities!! A little tape seems to go a long way, but I bought a 25 foot refill just in case. It takes a little playing around to decide which font sizes work well for what purposes, but it's an easy device to figure out. Two special requests for their product developers: Please put common symbols right on the keyboard so we don't have to scroll through a menu to find dashes, slashes and ampersands. And please provide a single button that wipes out all the text when we create a new label. It's a pain to only have the backspace button to do the job (prospective purchaser please note that when you turn the label maker on, it will come up with the text of the last label you made, not a new clean slate). Otherwise, a very fun and potentially obsessive toy for home and office organization.",,,06 Mar 2018

This is the first rechargeable label maker I've owned. Instead of using AA batteries that are dead every time you need it, it has built in battery that lasts a good long time (months depending on use). Another reason I picked it up specifically was so I can get generic branded labels for much cheaper than typical label makers sell their tape for. I really like the fact it has built in memory.

This label maker sucks on Mac, the light software would not work at all on Mac. The downloaded software had to be 8.5.2, and it still stopped working, and full re-install didn't get it going. Below are instructions to help delete the proper files, but I quit on the 3rd time it quit... I'm not re-installing software everytime I use the label maker. Possible driver conflicts. They got four hours of my life, and I'm not going to use terminal to troubleshoot their driver or conflict issues or whatever is happening - ( bad Mac support Dymo). I run a late 2012 MacMini on High Sierra, and it's up to date as of 2/3/18, upgraded, and it's a very dependable Mac. (Possibly interfering with my network HP printer drivers?) ANYWAY: On windows 10, the light software could work, but I still had to download v8.7 from Dymo to change fonts. So far it plays nice with Windows, and I will update if that is not the case in the near future... MAC NOTES: Enter the following review and use it if you like to play with Mac and figure stuff out, but I decided to grab my dusty miniPC from storage and print my labels from Windows. GOOD LUCK.... This is a simple black and white printer for making labels. The ease of use is very good. With my Mac, I had to download the software from the internet to make it work properly. As such, it was slightly more work than promised. After inserting the included battery, and roll of tape, plugging in the USB and power adapter, the unit powered on and the software came up - see your instructions. On a Mac, the included software popped up but wouldn't let me click inside the label to edit my label, make a new label, or print. The upper right icon in the light software CAN be clicked to download newest version software... then on Mac, you drag and drop to Applications and wait for it to install - took 5-10 minutes for mine... then, you can change fonts and sizes and print labels. Finally, after going through these software issues, I do have a small profile label maker at a price I can handle. Kudos to Dymo for reaching out to the non-OCD people who don't want to spend too much on labels we don't make very often. Check the different options for label tape on Amazon or the Dymo website. You can find more options there to go with your purchase. Reasonable and effective solution to orgazining my electronics so I know where all my cables and things are.",,,31 Jan 2018

It just plugs into a powered USB port on a computer, which recharges its battery. It does, as most label makers, cut off quite a bit of unprinted tape, but no more than any other label maker I've used. Since it has to be plugged into a computer, it's not as portable as the handheld Dymo that I had previously, but once the software is opened on my computer, it's much easier to make labels using my keyboard than the keyboard on a handheld label maker. The software lets you insert text, an automatic updating counter, a few simple shapes and lines, barcodes, auto-updating date and time, circular text, and addresses from an address book (mine came with a dozen addresses -- maybe someone pre-owned my label maker??). You can also import your own graphics. Great choices -- the only problem is, I'm using the supplied 1/2 tape, so there's not much room. I uploaded and added a photo go a label, but it's very tiny. Still, useful software, mostly for borders and a good selection of fonts, sizes, and colors. Much more versatile than the hand-held label maker I'd been using. I experimented for quite a while and haven't yet used up the sample tape supplied, but I did purchase three extra, full-sized rolls -- black on white, black on clear, and white on clear.

I'm so excited for you!)! I already own a Brother brand labeler myself and bought this for a friend for Christmas. I was anxious to compare the two. Here's the skinny on this Dymo: - Cheaper than brother (both the unit itself and the tape cartridges) - Intuitive and easy to use - Love the QWERTY keyboard - Love that it has different outline, underline, text size and style options - LOVE that it doesn't waste NEARLY as much tape on the sides as my Brother model does (which can't be changed in settings). This is one of the major selling points for Dymo over Brother in my opinion. The tape cartirdges aren't cheap and when so much tape is wasted on either side of your text (which I usually just end up clipping off anyway) that really adds up! Hooray Dymo! The only thing that is lame about this particular model is that it only comes with ONE FONT. While the description is technically correct, I will say that it mislead me to believe that I would be getting multiple fonts when it told me there were 6 font styles. I have no idea what they think the difference is between 'font style' and 'text style' but to me a 'font style' is simply a different font and a 'text style' is referring to bold, italics etc. This feels very misleading and confusing and I am disappointed that there is only one font.

One thing I don't like is the amount of space it leaves before and after the text on each label. But this is a problem on most label makers I've had.

Comes with a small 10' starter tape cartridge that will let you test print some labels. I've been having some issues with third party tape cartridges printing too lightly the first few times after inserting a new cartridge, but I'm not sure that is a problem with the LabelManager PNP. Truthfully, I really wanted the LabelManager Wireless PNP instead, just for the 300dpi instead of just 180dpi for this model, but I could not justify the jump up in price.

The screen is not lighted, so be sure to work in good light. Keys are smallish, but bigger keys would make a bigger machine, and this one is a good size as is. Power cord is inexpensive ($9-ish) but shipping is just as much, making the cord cost almost as much as the machine.

Otherwise, it is very intuitive and does not waste a lot of tape. I do agree with the other reviewers to type out many words at once and then cut them apart with scissors instead of using the cutting tool after every word. That does seem to make the tape last longer. Also, buy the a/c adapter! I finally gave up and ordered it separately. Once the adapter arrived, I really like it.

9012,dymo labelmanager 280 rechargeable hand-held label maker (1815990),29.77,Great value,4.0 ,"The LabelManager 160 doesn't have all the bells and whistles. It would be nice to control it throught the computer and have a big screen to write on with an easier keyboard and more options. But for my personal needs, which are to label a few bins and files, spending on extra features is not of much value. This basic version has what I was looking for: - Prints quickly and easily. - Labels look professional. - Very clear to read. - Labels adhere well. The adhesive backing requires some effort to remove. Through some trial-and-error I have found that using tape works well to remove the backing of the labels. With a little practice, I was peeling off the backing without much hassle by the 20th label or so. The positive of the backing being hard to remove, is that if the label resists coming off a surface it is designed to not-adhere to, it will probably stick strongly to just about anything that needs to be labeled. It uses 6 AAA batteries, which seems to be a lot from my perspective, but all things considered, the expense of the label maker with the batteries are a great value for the labeling I intend to do.",,,09 Dec 2017

There are quite a few of my stone/crystals that are not in this book. Also, the book only shows one picture of most of the crystals. A crystal tumbled versus raw can look different. I don't feel like the pictures shown are very good representations of the crystals. The information is good for what stones they do cover. However, I find myself just googling my stones or searching for stones that way. I really wanted to like this book, but I just don't. I like it just enough to not return it, but if I were to do it all over again I would have purchased this book: http://amzn.com/1592335829",,,17 May 2016

9068,the crystal bible,9.13,prove it,2.0 ,"I bought this book without really looking into it. I relied on the reviews of the masses to make my decision. I have an education in natural science and have a hard time accepting the claims expressed in this book without any references or observable data. I have found through my own research and intuition that crystals/rocks/gems definitely have an influence on there local environment. The author has done nothing to offer the reader any insight into how these crystals effect the body and why. This is a perfect example of why this science is still viewed as a pseudoscience at best or even quackery. Where is the proof? For interested parties in the science of crystals/rocks/ gems I have been enjoying the book ROCK AND GEM by Bonewitz. This is an awesome book very comprehensive and completely absent from the carefree statements that plaque this legitimate science. However there is an obvious gap between the crystals structure and composition and effect on the persons near it. What is stopping me from writing a book like this, how would the reader know if what I write is credible?",,,08 Apr 2016

I realize this isn't a scientific text, but how can I trust the validity of the metaphysical properties of these stones that are detailed in this book when they can't even get the physical facts right? Amazonite is not ""opalescent,"" amber is certainly not opaque. Obviously the author doesn't even know what these words mean. Also it pissed me off that all of the pictures of ""citrine"" were actually heat treated amethyst, which I'm sure just further causes confusion for people on that matter. This was a waste of time and money, I'm definitely returning it.",,,14 Mar 2016

I used to visit a metaphysical shop where the owner would use this book as a reference and kindly explain the properties of each crystal I'd purchased to me. I finally purchased the book and am glad I did. I initially started collecting crystals simply because I find them so lovely, but the more I collect, the more I become fascinated by their metaphysical properties. This guidebook is a great go-to reference that I find myself consulting frequently. Why only three stars?: There are two additional volumes referencing crystals not mentioned in the book. I'm definitely interested in having all three volumes, but the price just isn't within reach for me- also one book is definitely more practical than three. It would be so much easier, affordable, and appeasing to the crystal aficionado to combine all three volumes into one.

It's too bad Judy didn't have someone review this text as a draft and then re-write it in a way that is not distracting to the reader. It's hard to read one sentence without getting hung up on a mistake you'd rather edit. And then you find yourself asking: what did I just read? Oh - something I read a minute ago but with two words changed. Anyway, you get the point. ""Anyone"" could have written this.

This might (hopefully) bring to someone's attention the fact that the color register on some of the plates is so far off I can't even recognize the stone. Ruby in Zoisite image on p 251; I've never seen zoisite that was that color, even the lowest quality stones, and the 'ruby' is a peculiar shade of orange-red. (Generally it's pinkish-purple.) Sugilite, page 279--umber brown image of a stone that's so vividly purple it makes your eyeballs drool. P 130--the picture of 'blue' fluorite is olive green and red. Rhodonite, p 246; looks red-orange, like dyed howlite. Page 244--orange rhodochrosite. Hmm...never seen bright orange rhodochrosite. It's interesting, but if I was a beginner trying to use this book as a reference, I'd be way messed up. 218--pietersite...doesn't do the glorious chatoyance of that stone justice. Seriously. Page 185--malachite with chrysocolla--one of the most vividly GREEN and BLUE stones around--and the image is black and brown; yet on p 182 it's bright green. Huh? Azeztulie, p. 75--""colorless or white"" below the image of a honey-gold stone. Geez. Page 195? The description for 'Nebula Stone' says, ""Black with green spots."" which is correct. The image? Black with brown spots. WTH? Larimar, p. 174--Ewwww. Okay, I've seen stones that color--low grade greenish-blue stones, but d'wanna see larimar? Come on over. I'll show you the blazing, neon-sky blue of a nice piece of larimar! It would have been nice to see the range of colors in a stone like that, since the color directly impacts what you'll pay for the stone. And yet difficult images to capture--like the Rainbow obsidian image on p 201--they got perfectly! (I'm shaking my head in bewilderment, but you can't see me.) Secondly, although for the most part the information in this book is good and concise, some of the info is a little misleading. Again, take Larimar. ""Rarity"" is listed as ""easily obtained,"" and yet it's one of the most expensive stones around, and there's only one place in the world where it's found. It's flooded the market now, but in ten years it's going to be like buying hen's teeth. I really, really hope that the color issues didn't occur in every print run of this book.

Paraiba Tourmaline only comes from Paraiba Brazil...everything else is just Tourmaline Herkimer Diamonds come from New York, Himalayas and China. Same with the Paraibas, Herkimer Diamonds only come from Herkimer New York, anything else is a double Terminated Quartz. It is mainly little things like locations that are incorrect, but since this is a book that people are turning to for information it should be correct and properly researched. This was the only problem I had with this book, the photos, layout and other features I found useful.",,,17 Jul 2009
9137,the crystal bible,9.13,My Thougts on This Book,3.0 ,"A nice supplement to the Crystal Bible which was one of my first crystal/mineral books and is still one of my favorites. However... I'm not as complete of a fan of Crystal Bible 2 as I am of the original. Some (and I'm saying only some) of the info seems quite hastily put together, and in my opinion isn't a complete description of the attributes of that particualr crystal or mineral. There's one in there that I don't agree with at all from my personal work with that mineral, but I choose not to mention which one that is in this forum. I've also noticed a couple of unusual spellings for names of a particular crystal or mineral. One thing in particular I'd like to point out. Septarian is a combination of Calcite, Bentonite and Aragonite, not Calcite, Aragonite, and Chalcedony...but I suppose that could depend on who you ask. My gut still says the first combination of minerals is correct. Now that I've aired my concerns a bit, I will say that I'm not unhappy with this book. Perhaps my personal knowledge and skills have just developed beyond the point of being able to accept everything said by Judy as 100% complete and accurate. I think it's a good reference tool, but I would not use as my *only* reference tool. I'm not sorry I purchased this book, would do so again, and have already recommended it to others.",,,15 Jul 2009
9138,the crystal bible,9.13,Not for begginers...,3.0 ,"Althought it has nice pictures and very nice info, there are many stones listed that are not found easily. I recommend the first volume if you are new to stones and their properties. I will continue to study all the stones listed anyway!",,,08 Jul 2009
9139,the crystal bible,9.13,A means of expanding upon Vol. I,3.0 ,"Although Judy Hall's books don't generally do it for me, I do recommend both volumes of the Crystal Bible. In fact, bypass all her other recent works for these two. It will be more complete than juggling three or four volumes. This book is like many of her others, with listings of hundreds of stones and their many different forms. The entries are a little bit more simplified than in the first volume, and there is no easy summary of the properties of any stone. The strength of this work is that it is arranged alphabetically, rather than by colour, wherein several of her others are less user-friendly for the opposite reason. There are still some misnomers and photographs that are not exactly representative of the crystal being defined, as well as a seemingly missing understanding of the mineralogical properties of the specimens being described. Some of the entries appear to be inconsistent and incongruent with those around them. This is possibly an error in publishing, and a second printing or edition may have these errata corrected. This volume contains more than two hundred stones not mentioned in volume one. To my knowledge there are no repeats from said volume. the book covers a lot of formations and findings that are very recent and otherwise unpublished about. Several stones have their trade names used, which do not reflect the mineral being described, and others are merely tyographically incorrect (i.e. ""Brandenberg"" where Brandberg should be used). With some simple and effective introductory chapters regarding the history and lore of the mineral kingdom, and New Age crystal topics such as grids, new areas of mining, and stones with high frequencies, you'll find that this book is a nice companion to any crystal library.",,,27 Jun 2009
9140,the crystal bible,9.13,Should not be a faith-based study,1.0 ,"Maybe Hall calls it a ""Bible"" because you have to surrender your reason and have faith in her to get the vision. Hall produced a beautiful little book. Seductively laid out in the best way possible. Easy to use, logical in format, and gracious on the eyes. The subject matter is fascinating. As humans evolve it's becoming obvious to more and more people that there is a plane superior to the material plane on which energy is transformed. Gemstones have a unique signature in this way and they can employed to the benefit of humankind. The flaw, the deep fatal and overwhelming flaw in the book, is not just the lack of evidence for the qualities assigned to each gem, but the plain contempt demonstrated to any rational person, that this is even an issue. I am professional involved in many ""new-age"" activities and I never cease to be appalled and amused at the bottomless gullibility of the consumer. I am NOT accusing her of holding gemstones in her hands and writing down how groovy it makes her feel in what direction. But if there is a legitimate methodology involved in her enterprise then it ought to be noted. The only other possibilities are 1) there is no legit methodology and the basis of what she does is nonsense based on faith in her ""intuition"" so she CAN'T put it forth; or 2) she DOES have a legit method here, but you just have faith little one, don't worry your head about such things -- just leave it to us high spirit gurus. Hall mentions the traditions of Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda in passing, but that's a very tiny part of the input here. The greater bulk of this book is pure new-age speculation. I hope I'm wrong, because if it's all correct stuff here the book is invaluable. But there is no reason to believe that the info is real, outside of one's ""faith"" in her ""bible.""",,,10 Jun 2009
9141,the crystal bible,9.13,The Crystal Bible,3.0 ,"I purchased this book the same time i purchased ""The Book of Stones."" It has been a great guide to help with things that are not in the the other book. It is good when used in conjunction with The Book of Stones. Alone this book doesn't have the same impact as if used together. But it is a great little guide when you can't keep the bigger book around. I give this book 1 Thumb up.",,,06 Mar 2009
9142,the crystal bible,9.13,monotone,3.0 ,"ok, well the book is pretty and all, but it is monotone in the fact that it mainly focuses in stuff such as healing, sicknesses and chakras, it's doesn't tell u much about the magickal properties such as protection and luck.... everything was pretty science-ish souding, as she was a doctor, if you are into healing i highly recommened it but if you are like me and want some magick info get something else",,,03 May 2008
9143,the crystal bible,9.13,"Ok for beginners, but should not be relied upon",3.0 ,"Having experience with Melody's Crystal Healing and her book ""Love is in the Earth,"" I have found that this book is OK for people beginning to work with crystals and stones, but that it has a lot of misinformation. For example, Carnelian DOES NOT cleanse other stones. Only Selenite can do that. Don't rely totally on the information in this book. If you want the definitve, go to Melody.",,,06 Nov 2007
9144,the crystal bible,9.13,"Hate to slam this, but....",3.0 ,"This book is really helpful for you if you already know what crystals you have in your collection, or if you just want to know the corresponding chakras or different uses. However, I bought this to help me identify a huge bag of crystals I bought and it fell short. The images are pretty hard to see, there should be more images of the different variations an agate can come in for example. It should have its original form, colored form, tumbled form etc. The index is pretty hard to use and not ""idiot"" proof. They fail to mention some major crystals that are out there and are just as important as a snowflake obsidian for example. If you know what you have, this book is very helpful, but if you're not an expert, probably not the cheapest and not the easiest book to get.",,,03 Jul 2007
9145,the crystal bible,9.13,A Reference Book for Crystals,3.0 ,"This is a picture book of rocks and gems. But not ALL rocks and gems. I have not found one that big and complete. You'll have to do as I have done, buy several books for your rocks and gems reference library. You should have this one in your reference library. It is as it is titled -- a book specifically dealing with rocks and gems known as ""Crystals."" If your curiosity gets the better of you, buy it. It'll answer some of your questions, but not all of them. That's the reason for the other books.",,,03 Nov 2006
9146,the crystal bible,9.13,Factual errors flaw the presentation,2.0 ,"I had high hopes for the book as it proclaimed itself ""The Crystal Bible."" One expects some accuracy with such a proclamation. However, I was a bit disconcerted when I got to the section on Chrysoberyl where I read that it is a form of Beryl. That is simply not true. Beryl is Beryllium Aluminum Silicate that forms in the hexagonal crystal structure. Chrysoberyl is an Oxide that forms in the Orthorhombic crystal structure. They are different minerals and different crystals. Also, I think it should have been mentioned that some of the ""new crystals"" are really new marketing names for minerals that have long been known and actually have little value. ""Azeztulite"" is simply opaque white quartz. Angelite is simply blue anhydrite. I can take no issue with the uses and attributes ascribed to the crystals because the author states on the last page that her knowledge of the crystals is mostly intuitive and is based on 30 years of experience. That much experience must have led her to a great understanding of the crystals and their powers. I also found the photos to be excellent allowing the book to serve as a great visual reference. I would hope that the next edition would have some of the factual information reviewed and corrected. This would make the book much more valuable as a reference.",,,11 Sep 2005
9147,the crystal bible,9.13,Useful Crystal guide but not very exciting or deep,3.0 ,"This is a Useful book for people who want a standard introductory guide to some ( mostly)common crystals and stones for ""New Age"" uses and crystal healing. Each stone has a page with a picture and brief standard description of attributes and information about use for healing . There is a very tiny section in the back about the aura, chakras and methods of crystal healing. This incudes a bit about use of gem remedies,grids and Laying on of stones but is way too short. This is a book of crystal properties rather than instrutions on applications There is not much here about magic/kal uses but much could be deduced. The information is assembled from many other sources and is the same as you find in almost every other crystal book. The book is useful if not exciting or really connected with the evolving energy of the crystals. It presents Crystals more as objects and tools rather than as living spirits and partners or connectors with spiritual and healing energies and intellegence. There is nothing particularly original in this book but it is well done if limited. It coulds be a useful reference and is small enough to carry with you when you shop.",,,25 Jul 2005
9148,the crystal bible,9.13,I'm sorry I spent the $$,1.0 ,"I'm going to be the one grouch! :) I bought this book while I was on vacation this week and desperate for something to read, and I'm sorry I spent the $$ on it. Not only have I always loved and collected stones, I have an Earth Science degree specializing in Mineralology, Crystalography, and Paleontology. I have a very extensive library on stones, ranging from the complicated reference tomes to magical properties. I didn't care for the statements without explanations or the failure to include alternate names, and many of the properties just didn't jive with my personal experiences or what's ""known"". That's no big deal--each person can have a different experience with or reaction to a stone. What really turned me off from the book were the blatant errors in fact. Just one (1) mistake out of many was the statement that star sapphires have five points. The star in a sapphire (or other stones) is caused by very fine inclusions of fibers or needles crossing (asterism), and the points only occur in even numbers. There were numerous technical errors similar to that, which make me think it wasn't just a typo. The only decent thing about the book was some of the pictures, but you can get that in any good mineralology reference book, and those sometimes have good folklore info also. I can't give even the pictures a full thumbs-up because I'm suspicious of a few. There are MUCH better books out there. I was not impressed.",,,19 Feb 2005

It has been an invaluable reference not only for the fantasy romance I write, but for my own use. I have always been fascinated with stones, and after looking through this book, I can see why I was drawn to a few of them in particular. The pages are well organized and in full-color, which helps when trying to identify a particular stone you are looking for. The index is where I spend most of my time, as it breaks down the ailment you wish to correct, and then directs you to the stone (or stones) that can help. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking for an easy to use reference book on healing stones. And by the way, it is the perfect size to travel with!",,,01 Aug 2017

I’m disabled and live with moderate to severe chronic pain (depending upon the particular day), but still do as much as I’m physically able and still wanted to take good care of our newest set of cookware; so I’ve been very careful to follow the instructions, and even to educate the rest of the family on its use and care. Well, after a little over a month of use and care, we’ve reached the point where I can’t stand for anyone to use this cookware, because I’m the one who usually has to clean it (I have the most time, and can’t stand for dirty dishes to clutter the sinks and counters). Today, I had to clean scrambled eggs from the same pan twice, and I’m physically in awful shape tonight (terrible pain). It doesn’t seem to matter how closely we follow the manufacturer’s instructions, how much we grease a pan ahead of time, etc., everything sticks to these pans very badly, and is nearly impossible to remove (and no ~ we don’t burn our food). I wish to goodness we’d tried some other cookware. It’s now too late to return this.

9642,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,I bought this stainless roaster because of the great reviews here on Amazon,1.0 ,"I bought this stainless roaster because of the great reviews here on Amazon. It came as promised and when I opened it, was beautiful and shiny. The next day I was having company and I prepared a standing rib roast. It called for a cooking temp of 500 degrees for 40 minutes and then shut off the oven for two hours and don't open the door. After the two hour cook time with the oven off I pull out a gorgeous prime rib cooked perfectly and delicious. The pan however had turned a copper color and when I washed and cleaned it the stainless had flaked off the aluminum in the bottom of the pan. There was no cleaning the pan back to anything that looked like silver or clean. The rack, which got the low scores on the review, did however come through beautifully and cleaned up like brand new. For the investment, I would rather have put another few bucks on it and got one that could handle more than one roast before looking 40 years old and like it had been used over a camp fire. Since the rack will most likely be employed with each roasting, I guess the stainless flaking off the aluminum core wont hurt anything but it still sucks that you pay good money for a quality name like Cuisinart and come out with a total turd like this. Unless you are roasting a couple of Cornish hens or slow roasting at low temps, stay away from this junk. My moms 60 year old blue speckled roaster is still the best one I own.",,,23 Apr 2018

I then cooked two slices of bacon, allowing the pan to preheat on medium and then reducing the heat. As soon as the heat got up to medium temperatures, the pan spun easily and rocked back and forth on the stovetop.

9718,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,"Gorgeous pan, but mine had a rounded bottom. Insert joke here!!",3.0 ,"First off, this pan is wonderful. It is attractive, cooks wonderfully, and was easy enough to use and clean, for a full stainless pan. Why three stars? The bottom was not flat. That is a deal breaker for me, so mine is going back. I think it could just be a defective pan, so YMMV. I did have a little trouble getting the pan to give me textbook leidenfrost effect. This is the process to make sure your pan is fully preheated, and thus, fairly non stick. Now non stick in a stainless pan is not non stick in the way that Teflon, or ceramic would be non stick. Things can and may stick to the pans surface. But this surface is non stick in the way a well seasoned BBQ grill grate is non stick. When a properly preheated surface has brought protein to the proper temperature, the protein will release, and thus be non stick. However, bits of protein and fat may remain. These can easily be removed with a deglazing process. Deglazing is what makes this pan a Star. You can build amazing pan sauces, and gravies with this pan. I cooked breakfast sausage in the pan. The sausage released and cooked beautifully. I found most of the cooking surface to cook and brown the sausage fairly evenly. There was a small 10% zone area near the handle that browned more slowly. I assume the handle absorbed and radiated some of the heat from this area. You will see the variation in my sausage picture. It however, left nice little bits of protein and fat, for one of the nicest sausage gravies I’ve made. Non stick Plastic pans will never build a gravy like this. Cast iron can, but is more difficult, because of the darkness of the pan. Stainless is much more forgiving with wet cooking like pan sauce, or gravy, than cast iron would be. Making clean up a snap, comparatively. I tried this pan after a seasoning process, with a high temp cooking oil, and I tried it unseasoned. I found it equally non stick either way. Though, if you use the leidenfrost test, preseasoned pans will not work. Well what is Leidenfrost effect, you ask? The Leidenfrost effect in this case is when a properly preheated pan will cause a drop of water to dance around the pan like a mercury ball. I was somewhat successful in this test at level six cooking on my Fridgidair inductive cook top. My water droplet was somewhat more flat than I would expect, but held together and danced a bit. When I preheated my pan, I gave it a few seconds on low, then turned it to level 3, for about a minute, then finally up to level 6. Induction cook tops raise the temp very quickly, this can warp a bonded pan. So for the love of Rachel Ray, dont set your induction cook top to high and fire this puppy up!! I’ll restate here, my pan was rounded out of the box. I decided to test it out for a few days since I had it. I did not warp this pan. The pan is attractive enough to leave out, and the lid is very helpful in preheating, and melting, and reducing splatter.",,,07 Dec 2017

I sent it in for a replacement, did the exact same steps with the replacement only with 3/9 heat and the pan had already warped after adding the oil.

I also have and used the All-Clad stainless pans side by side and find the performance darn close. All-Clad seems to clean up easier and the handles and lids do not get as warm as the Cuisinart MCP though the MCP handles are a bit easier to hold when cleaning and are shorter. I also noticed the Cuisinart pots show white spotting from boiling water or other liquids, but bar keepers friend cleans it up without issue. I have read Cuisnart no longer uses 18/10 stainless to make these pots and considering Cuisnart does not indicate the metal used anywhere I imagine it is something around 18/4 or maybe a little better, probably why the All-clad cleans easier (Amazon needs to fix the description as it is not 18/10 stainless). I wish it came with the 12"" fry pan rather than the 8"" or 10"" but the 10"" is sufficient and the 8"" is great for a couple of eggs. Update 3/2018: the saute pan has warped a bit, even with careful use. I have tried to warranty the pan with no luck. Customer Support is almost non-existent. I have called 4 times, been given a service authorization number of some sort and sent 3 emails with required info and have not been contacted or provided any warranty service.

I hand-washed it gently after each use. I also registered it with Cusinart before I even used it. In less than one year, the non-stick lining began to roll off the rim (see photo). I decided to order an identical replacement. When it arrived, I noticed the box said it had a ""Limited Lifetime Guarantee"" so I called Cusinart customer service. They said to take a photo of the damaged pan top and bottom and email it to their customer service staff who would follow up with instructions in 10-15 days if they believed it was faulty. I did so and got a ticket number from Cusinart. But despite numerous attempts to reach them since, it's now been a few months and no word. So, I can only assume they will not stand behind their guarantee. If you want to spend this much for a great pan that will last only a short time, this is the pan for you.",,,11 Jul 2017

First thing I did was to test whether it had the ""corroding rivets"" issue. Fresh out of the brand new packaging box, I rinsed the inside with water and then filled it with just under 8 quarts of cold tap water, making sure the rivets were submerged. Then I also added 2 tablespoons of white distilled vinegar (a mild acid). I placed it over the stove and turned up the heat until the water temperature was high enough to start a few small bubbles to form on the bottom of the pot (guessing it reached around 150F) then turned off the heat and placed the lid on and allowed it sit for 8 hours. Eight hours later, the results show the rivets did react with the very, very mildly acidic water and vinegar combination. I can feel small pits in the rivets with my fingers and some material has definitely been eroded. Save yourself the trouble. Do not buy this pot unless you want to find out on your own - the hard way. Cuisinart needs to recall this product and check each pot for this defect before it puts it back on sale again.

None of this is relevant if you can't build a stainless steel pot that doesn't corrode in the presence of common cooking ingredients such as tomatoes. Maybe this product line was once good, but I don't understand having this high of reviews for products that cut costs on the details. This is not a spot of corrosion, this is a defect in the materials selected for constructing the pan. It does not have an all-stainless interior. I wonder what precious cents they saved by using aluminum rivets instead of stainless, but in the end it takes what could have been great and makes it unusable.

I have cookware pieces from at least 3 other sets and some of them are super cheap random things of a useful size I inherited from my mother and none of them have this issue. Even with Barkeepers Friend Cleaning powder and special scrubbing pads that we have used since day one, this set is much harder to keep clean and after only a year they are showing more signs wear and tear on their surface than my mother's 50yr old pots that have survived several generations of abuse from babies and newbie cooks. About the only good thing I can say about this set is the sizes of everything is perfect! This might sound like a small thing but it's really kinda huge. Perhaps this set is all standard sizes for the types of pots and pans but I am upgrading from an oddball mix I inherited from several family members so each lid would fit only one pot or pan and no other, which sucked, and the burners on the range never lined up with the bottom of the cookware properly there was always some weird over or underlap going on.

Now here's the thing, the rivets on the lid that came with it are fine...no discoloration, they are shiny and hard just like my 15 year-old set. Its clearly a manufacturing problem with the rivets on the pot. Very sad. UPDATE: The pot comes with a ""lifetime warranty"", and I've had it replace four times--a total of five pots--and every single one of them had the same problem to a varying degree. Oddly, every time I contacted customer service, they would ask, ""did you put salt in before you boil water""???? What? First, I didn't buy this pot to boil water, I cook in it. Second, if they are suggested the pot has a problem boiling water...Anyway, I sprung for a similar All Clad....Williams Sonoma was having a sale and I had an old gift card from a friend. I'm sure it will be worth every penny over the years.",,,19 Mar 2016

Honestly, the pots and pans are ok, but nothing to get excited about. I've found the pots and pans tend to stain very easily. After a 2 months I found pitting and staining on the bottom of my frying pan. I seen people comment that all you have to do is use some cleaner to scrub the pans out - that's all well and good, but one should not have to do that! Its one of the reasons for buying stainless steel in the first place! I previously had a missed matched set of Hoffritz pots and pans with clad bottoms and thought I was stepping up with the cuisinarts ---sadly mistaken. I would argue that the cheap-o Hoffritz pots and pans out perform the cuisinarts significantly. The Hoffritz pots and pans cleaned up better, cooked more uniformly, and I had less problems with food sticking than do with the Cuisinarts. As potential purchasers, you need to be aware that the term ""stainless steel"" is a very general term. The steel formulation will dictate the stain resistance of the product. These pots and pans are made in China - and the Chinese-made stainless steel products that I've purchased in the past have generally been a disappointment - these pots an pans are following that trend.

Another problem is that the bottom is not flat at all, for induction owners this will be a huge problem, because it will be dancing in the stove and the heat wouldn't transfer to the roasting pan, defeating the purpose of its magnetic stainless steel finish. I didn't want to cook with it because of the pitting that occurred to a lot of reviews so I returned it. I'm adding pictures so everyone can see this and think if is a good idea to buy this roasting pan. Good luck with your research.",,,14 Jan 2015

10026,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,Nice--but some problems,2.0 ,"In many ways, this pan set is very nice, and I hope my rating is not unfair. Here are the things that bothered me. First, the pans are quite heavy--not beyond the pale, but definitely heavier than All Clad, for example. In itself, that might not be a big problem, but the handles are essentially flat and highly polished. The polish makes the handles somewhat slippery, and the flatness doesn't allow a good grip. I noticed this especially when tipping a pan to, for example, pour off the cooking water. The handle design combined with the weight did not allow me to feel secure when handling the pans. Also, the selection of pans included in the set was far from optimal. Sauce pans are one of the real workhorses of a pan set and everyone needs at least 3--this set includes only 2, which is not enough. Everyone needs one nonstick fry pan, and this set includes none. If a larger sauce pan were included in the set, then the steamer pan would not be needed, because an ordinary steamer basket would suffice, and takes up lots less room in the cabinet. The high-sided saute pan is also a rarely-needed item. Also, like many high-end pans with metal handles, the handles are quite long. The length makes the pans more problematic to fit in the dishwasher and more difficult to store. I might also mention that fully triply pans like this make a difference when using a gas cooktop, but if using an electric cooktop, pans with only triply bottoms are essentially just as good, as well as being lighter and less expensive.",,,06 Jan 2015

The sauce pans (1-1/2 qt., 3 qt. and 4 qt.) are flawless, the cooking experience is great, just like America's Test Kitchen said, sadly, this skillet is a major disappointment. First use it started flat, I have a smooth top range and plan to upgrade soon to induction, by the time the pan had heated up to cooking temperature it was like a rocking horse. I am the cook of the house, the wife can but doesn't, I've been cooking since I was about 10 years old (I'm now 61) and I know how to cook properly and care for my cookware so it's not a matter of negligence on my part. I find myself in agreement with ATK now and will be replacing this skillet with the 12"" All Clad. FYI, the bottom of this skillet warped to a 1/4"" out heating 1 teaspoon of olive oil to a shimmer! Fortunately the sauce pans have been problem free after almost two weeks of constant use. I was planning to purchase the 5-1/2 qt.

I was initially wowed by how much faster SS cooks than analon or even cast iron, that was the appeal! And, it tasted better too, because the food seared so quickly. I didn't find the cleanup onerous, yes it stuck some but no problem. That was a previous generation of Cuisinart with glass lids, which I also loved, and I guess a thick aluminum base but pur SS sides otherwise. What a sear! But, not this baby. I think they engineered it to cook ""evenly"", with a layer of aluminum all over the pan, sandwiched by SS. But it removed all the sass! I'd rather have uneven but dynamic cooking than warm pudding cooking. Design and marketing strike again. I'm going to get the 700 series Classic with glass lid, which also is great for cooking fast and sealing flavor. This one will go back.

I don't know if it was used and being sold as new, but it seems like an easily scuffed surface. I ordered this WAaaaay last minute (got it the day before Thanksgiving) and really needed a pan to roast the turkey, so I contacted Amazon and they gave me a discount for the damages, which mostly seem cosmetic. I did not have any of the pitting or flaking off of the top layer during the roasting process. My turkey came out perfectly, but I don't know that the roaster really has anything to do with that since it was only acting as a drip pan, essentially. I was able to make perfect gravy in it, though, so I give it props for that. Nice flat surface, no problems on the stove top (I've got coils -- if anything, what I need is a new stove!). So, this seems to work fine, but it seems overpriced for such a ""name brand"" product that has such quality control issues. Seems like Cuisinart is relying on its name recognition and letting any effort to make a quality product go by the wayside.

10055,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,"Poor quality control, inconsistent manufacturing, flaking",2.0 ,"First the good things: heavy, thick-walled, nice handles, cooks stuff really well, cleans up easily, great price. I've returned three of these and kept one. Here's the history: November 2012, $85: The top of one side was dented badly enough that the top edge had a ripple. This did not occur in shipping--both the product box and shipping box were undamaged--so it probably left the factory that way. I sent it back for an exchange without making a close examination for additional flaws. I did notice, however, that the rack had a really nice smooth matte finish. December 2012: The replacement was a keeper (sort of). The bottom of the roaster is mostly flat, but liquid tends to pool a bit about the sides (unlike Cuisnart's Multiclad pots and pans which are completely flat on the bottom). The pooling is not consistent, so it's not clear if the pan is designed to have a channel or not. Either way, the manufacturing is sloppy. If you turn it over you can see that the bottom joins to the sides differently as you go around the pan. Some places there is a 90 curve between the bottom and the side. Other places it's more than 90 degrees so that a channel forms. Anyway, it works fine for cooking gravy on a gas stove top, but will not make contact everywhere on an electric glass top. There have been no issues with flaking or pitting. The rack is smooth matte, and welds are reasonably well finished. The rack handles are a bit crooked. June 2014, $55: The date of manufacture was stamped on the bottom, causing a small bump up in the interior of the pan. The previous pans did not have date stamps, and Cuisinart Multiclad pots and pans are engraved rather than stamped. AS THEY SHOULD BE. What kind of moron damages a product by crudely stamping the date into it? The pooling was more pronounced. The rack had a cheap shiny look and rough surfaces throughout, and the welds were poorly finished. One of the rack handles was at an obvious angle. I called Cuisinart and asked if this was normal quality for this product (okay, dumb question). The rep asked where I bought the pan and then transferred me to Amazon customer service without another word. Shipped back to Amazon for an exchange. June 2014: The replacement had a stamped manufacture date again, but the bottom was flatter, and the rack was acceptable quality (straight handles, smooth surfaces, okay welds). Now, however, there was something new: several small streaks of powdery black gunk stuck to the interior of the pan. Looked like something left over from the manufacturing process. Cleaned it up and decided the pan was good enough to keep. Using the patented Mark Bittman 45-minute-turkey method, I cooked a bird, and it turned out perfectly--well-browned all over, tender, moist, delicious--but when I cleaned up I noticed that a 1/4"" diameter piece of the stainless surface had flaked off. Never figured out where THAT went, but the pan went back to Amazon. At this point I have given up on Cuisinart and am roasting stuff in cast iron pots and pans, although that won't work for turkey. Amazon was great on the returns--no arguments and no shipping charges.",,,26 Aug 2014

It's very heavy, the handles are put on well. I do like the longer handles, which don't get hot when you cook. I used a lid on a saucepan and it did get slightly warm so I think if you are using lids for extended periods the handles would likely get hot. I am just starting my cooking journey with these pans. I made pudding using a metal whisk, which I only used gently and it did scratch the pot, which rather upset me. The pudding did come out nicely without sticking. I would think you ought to be able to use a metal whisk and expect it wouldn't scratch. There were absolutely no directions with the pots, no warning about this. Tried fried potatoes in the frying pan. I heated the pan a few minutes, then put in some oil and a little butter. Bits of potato made a solid brown mass on the bottom of the pan pretty quickly and the potatoes never did brown or get crisp. Very disappointing. The pan cleaned up pretty well, considering the mess stuck on it. I don't plan to put mine in the dishwasher as I think the soap for the machines is too harsh. I did buy a can of the barkeepers friend as recommended by some viewers and it does a nice job. I really hope things go better with these pots. It took me a long time to decide on them. I got tired of replacing non stick pots frequently and hated the risk of the surface coming off. I will update. My advice right now to anyone switching from non stick to SS is realize that they do cook differently. I haven't tried eggs yet, but the cooking instructor at CIA recommends you actually buy a non stick pan for eggs and use it only for eggs so I just assume eggs might be a problem sticking. ***Update--after using these pots for 2 months, I can say that I like the saucepans just fine, they heat up nicely and quickly especially when boiling. The frying pans I still don't like. I have gone back to using non stick frying pans. Really disappointed about that. Tried to do French toast the other day and it was a horrible mess, they stuck to the pan. Pretty much everything does.

I was so excited and couldn't wait for delivery of this steamer, but now I'm extremely disappointed that Cuisinart didn't do a better job of fitting (designing) this steamer to their own cookware! I put it on my 4-quart saucepan, and it immediately tipped over ... can't have that happening while cooking!! :( I tried turning it in all directions, and it wobbles and tips no matter what I do ... can't seem to get a good, solid fit. it would be better with short, ""helper handles"" on each side (like my old double boiler) for better balance ... not the one long handle, but, even then, it would still be too loose and let steam escape around its sides! I can't say just how unhappy I really am with Cuisinart for trying to put one over on us with this obviously inferior piece of ... needs to be a tighter fit. they made a mistake in trying to manufacture a ""universal"" steamer to fit all their saucepans. my old copper-bottom double boiler set from 40++ years ago has a much better fit (as it should) ... just wish this one did. Cuisinart should be ashamed for putting this on the market! I don't know what more I can say ... would give this zero stars, if I could! :( before purchasing this steamer from amazon, I even went to Cuisinart's web site and looked up exactly which saucepans this universal steamer should fit, and it should definitely fit the 4-quart Cuisinart multi-clad pro saucepan that I recently purchased from amazon. I've tried this steamer on all my non cuisinart saucepans, and it wobbles and tips badly on all of them! really, i'm so unhappy with this purchase that I can't think of the right words to say just how badly I feel without using words that should be censored. the only surface this pan is stable on is my granite counter top. now, i'm starting to wonder about the quality of the other Cuisinart pans I recently purchased! :( so far, they all seem great, and I've been very happy with them, but i'm withholding reviews on those until I've had a chance to use them a little more. UPDATE (same day): amazon is graciously refunding the money I spent. I've even written to Cuisinart about this. I don't know how something like this made it through their quality control. judging from other reviews, this steamer just might have a bad defect, but i'm afraid to take a chance and order another one. i'm going to try to find another good steamer set of some type, but I really did want a matching steamer for my already growing set of multiclad pro cookware. I would have paid more for a steamer pot that was made especially for my saucepan ... even would have bought another size saucepan with a matching steamer (one that really did fit well). I hate that some products are being made one size fits all nowadays, not doing justice to anything.

They don't limit the cooking ability, but they aren't pretty, and our pots and pans hang above a center island and we want them to look nice. These don't. The smoothness of the metal is subpar, and its hardness is lower than iron, gauging from the scratches that were picked up, I must assume, from ordinary spoons and spatulas. It appears the manufacture is either 1) using poor quality steel or 2) not using good quality control. Yes, they look great when you first use them, then after six months they look like something made in a third world country. I bought an additional two quart pan that was plainly labeled ""Made in the U.S.A."" and after several months of use, it makes the other pans look crappy, so I know what I'm talking about.

I used the pot the second time to reheat the soup, and after cleaning the pot, I counted 1 deep and 40 ""less"" deep pitting but ugly looking stains (for now). After a first use of 3Q pot for cooking pasta, there were stains and around the top inner side some black ""ring"" was created -- again looks that the tin layer of a brushed stainless steel probably disappeared and there is no way to clean it off to get a clean brushed stainless steel look back. Even some lids do not a have nice clean brushed stainless steel look, but they have a ""blackish"" look. Maybe, they brushed the stainless steel so much on bottom of lids and some pots around the inner top that there is left only an extra tin layer of stainless steel and it shows what's underneath. Who knows? This cookware seems to be made of very inferior quality, if after one use of a pot (after one cooking of rice for 20 minutes) something like that happens. Even if Cuisinart claims it is 18/10 stainless steel, probably the plant in China used for the production of these pots/pans used some cheap knock off version of 18/10 stainless steel. Probably that's why there is NO ANY MENTIONING of 18/10 stainless steel on the retail box for this set, and NONE OF POTS/PANS IS STAMPED as 18/10 stainless steel on the bottom -- just ""stainless steel"". Be aware that there is NO MENTIONING about a 18/10 stainless steel being used in this set on the Cuisinart website -- 18/10 stainless steel specifications appear only at Amazon or Newegg websites. The Cuisinart states: ""stainless steel for professional use"" on its website. What does it mean? It is hard to believe that the pots are stained/pitted/blackened after one use -- mostly to boil water for pasta, cook rice, or to heat soup!!! They even scratch easily inside when using bamboo utensils. If a pot looks ugly with stains/pitting that increase in amount after each cooking, and it cannot be cleaned with a water and detergent, what could I expect in a long run? Note: The quality of this set is HORRIBLE and except Amazon claiming that it is 18/10 stainless steel, there is no any confirmation of it on the Cuisinart website, a retail box or pots/pans. We have Tramontina cookware pieces for almost 8 years, with a stamped 18/10 stainless steel on the bottom of pots, and they were used many times. I never saw any peeling off of the top layer or black ""rings"" around the top -- similar to what I observed in Cusinart 1.5Q or 3Q Multiclad pots (only 2 pots I used from this set until now, because I already hate idea of ""testing"" the remaining pots). We also have a Kitchen Aid pot, with a stamped 18/10 stainless steel on the bottom of pot, and we use it the exactly same way as these Cuisinart pots (cooking rice, pasta, re-heating soup), and I never experienced pitting in years and large amount of stains after first couple uses.

He said there is no way to know when you buy their cookware if you are getting the 18/10 or 18/0 because it is not advertised on the outside of the box anywhere. He said some have it, some don't and you won't know until you open it up and look at the bottom of the pan. WHAT??!! He claims there is no difference in quality between the two and that is why they don't advertise it. So when you buy any of these products from Amazon, you won't know if you're getting 18/10 until you open the box. I am highly disappointed in Cuisinart. From the small amount of research I did, it seems that the absence of nickel in the 18/0 makes it much more likely to rust and possibly less durable.

10103,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,Non-stick coating peeled off--Orig: Bottom not flat,3.0 ,"I purchased two 8-in and one 10-in, the bottoms of all three pans are not flat, but rather concave up about 3/32 - in. On a ceramic top stove this results in uneven heating. While others have complained that the construction of the handle is flimsy having been changed from what was previously used, I don't agree. The shape has been changed somewhat, but it is still quite substantial and good looking. UPDATE 21 January 2014: The non-stick coating on one of the 8-in pans has started to peel off in a continuous sheet. This is not the usual nick or scratch one would expect, but rather the coating has become un-bonded from the base metal over an area of about 4-in by 2-in. If possible I will upload pictures of the defect. With regard to the concave up bottoms, I find that uneven heating (on my ceramic cook top) is not a significant issue. The non-flatness, however, is an annoyance when sautéing because the oil runs to edges leaving the center dry. UPDATE 8 April 2014: Within a few weeks of my 21 Jan. update, the second pan's non-stick coating also began to peel off. In California, warranty returns can be made to any of the product's retail dealers, but I could not find a Cuisinart dealer in my area that stocked these pans, and none of them would offer a refund. I contacted Cuisinart and they said to ship them the pans, along with $7.00 each, for their inspection and if they deemed the pans to be defective, they would be replaced.

10108,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,"Eh, tried to save some cash. . .my All Clad is MUCH better!",3.0 ,"I was torn when I made this purchase because I love All Clad. I did some research and found this to be quality worthy of purchasing. I needed two double boilers because I was making several kinds of chocolate truffles and coating them in chocolate, and did not want to spend the another $50ish on a second All Clad. I tried using a metal bowl and it worked but it was a pain not having a handle. So I decided that I would buy one All Clad and one Cuisinart double boilers ($35ish). Perhaps I missed this in the description or it wasn't listed, but this double boiler does not have a flat bottom - the bottom is rounded! Honestly, this is illogical!! A double boiler is typically for melting chocolate - the microwave is not the same when melting chocolate and you cannot make ganache in the microwave. Point is, when the chocolate has melted, the double boiler is not only pulled off the flame it is also pulled off the pot of water it is nestled on or you chance scorching the chocolate or blooming the chocolate once it has cooled. I was disappointed that I could not set this directly on the counter, I had to have an additional cold pot to set this in. I was also inconvenienced by this. This double boiler is a complete pain in the booty. There are too may groves (to accommodate multiple size pots) and melting chocolate gets into these grooves no matter how careful you are. This makes melting chocolate quite the chore and had me frustrated. If that wasn't bad enough, cleaning all the chocolate filled grooves is painstaking. Yes, you can soak the pot but you will still have to get a sponge in the grooves to wash all of the chocolate out. It was not worth the money I saved verses purchasing a second All Clad double boiler because of all the inconveniences with this Cuisinart, the majority of the time, I opted to use the All Clad over this one. Which was another inconvenience because the whole point of purchasing two double boilers with multiple truffles in the making was to obtain convenience. I would not recommend this double boiler for melting chocolate unless you do not mind all of the problems I mentioned. However, although chances are mega slim I will ever melt chocolate in this double boiler, I will use it for cheese fondue (that needs to stay on the heat).",,,17 Jun 2013

I thought I could get past the scratch inside, as it was rather small. But after using the rack for roasting our turkey, when I cleaned up the pan, I noticed the rack left loads of scratched plating where you could see through to the black underneath, just like the original scratch. This was after once use. Also, there was some very small pock marks--pitting. I had no choice but to use it for Thanksgiving and then send it back. I have since had pitting problems with my other Cuisinart Multi-clad pots I own. These problems did not show up at first, but took around 6-months of almost daily use to show. I suspect most people writing reviews here either aren't looking very closely for pitting and scratching, or write their laudatory reviews after one or two uses.

(I shipped it overseas.) The set is very beautiful and heavy. The first time I used it (10-inch skillet), the food got stuck a bit, but it's because I wasn't very good at using stainless steel to cook. I actually started to learn how to deglaze my sautee pan and so on, and it's been great experimenting and learning new recipes. I also made small omelets for my 2 year-old son with the 8-inch skillet, and they do not stick to the pan at all. (Note: heat the skillet first, then add some butter and heat it, then add the eggs.... Cooks beautifully.) Cleaning is very easy and fast. I wash with warm water and soap with a wash cloth, nothing abrasive, then towel dry. There are some mineral spots (the water in my area is quite mineral-heavy), but it's a minor issue. I do not use Barkeepers Friend. So far I've not had any reason to do so. I'll update my review after I use the set for a while. UPDATE AFTER 1 WEEK OF USE: I'm reducing the rating by one star because the set scratches so easily. I don't use any metal utensils, just wooden and plastic spatulas, and I can see scratches all over some of the pots and pans. I can't decide what I want to do about it yet. A part of me wants to return, but another part of me wonders if the replacement set will scratch easily as well. UPDATE AFTER 2 WEEKS: I have no choice but to return this set. I can't believe the pots are pitted after only a couple of uses -- mostly to boil water or to heat cream-based soup! I have no idea if it's normal or not. I always used medium or low heat w/ the set.

They do do what they are supposed to do. That being said, here are a few things to consider. 1. A mirror finish on any set of cookware that's going to be used regularly is, to put it simply, a stupid idea. I shrugged it off, and am now continuously annoyed. 2. The sizing of the stuff included in this set is, like many sets of pots and pans, a little off. It's functional, but less than ideal. * For a family, the 8-inch skillet is too small to cook much of anything in, except maybe the occasional breakfast for one. But... it's stainless steel, so no one in their right mind would cook eggs or other potentially sticky food in it when they could just use cast-iron or non-stick. * The 10-incher is better, and suitable for lots of stuff, but again, I find that I almost always prefer a 12-inch for most of my cooking (for two adults and two kids). So it's just enough, but not ideal. * The stock pot is a bit too big and the sauce pans a bit too small to comfortably make most of the standard things the average family makes (a package of pasta, a decent sized but not enormous batch of soup). Again... I'm annoyed nearly every time I want to use these. For future reference, I'll look a lot more closely at the sizing and try to find local examples before buying online.

10120,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,"Looks good, very poor execution",1.0 ,"I really wanted to like this pan. The three-ply construction sounds great. It looks like a very serious cooking tool with the brushed stainless exterior. Unfortunately, the execution on this pan leaves much to be desired. My first use of the new pan was cooking some pasta. From watching the water come up to temperature I could tell the pan had excellent heat dispersion. There were virtually no hot spots from the gas flame. Cleaning the pan after cooking the pasta I noticed what looked like spots where something had stuck to the bottom of the pan. I scrubbed a little harder and still they wouldn't come out. Upon closer inspection I realized it wasn't stuck on pasta but several spots where the inner layer of stainless steel had flaked away. I know virtually nothing of metallurgy, but that inner layer of stainless looks awfully thin to me. And it clearly hasn't been properly adhered to the aluminum core if it flakes off after simply boiling water in the pan. I notified Amazon of the defect and they immediately sent out a replacement. I used the new pan to again cook some pasta. First use and the stainless inner layer begins to flake. One defective pan might be a fluke. Two defective pans in a row and I have to think Cuisinart has a serious design or manufacturing defect. Personally, I think they've scrimped too much on the stainless steel, making the inner layer way too thin. I do know I've had two pans fail on the very first use under far less than strenuous conditions. If the pan can't boil water under a medium flame without literally falling apart, there's a serious issue. I've posted photos of both pans so you can see for yourself what I'm talking about. In both cases there is significant discoloration of the stainless surrounding the spots that have flaked off. A couple of the spots are about 1/16"" diameter. You'll probably have to zoom the photos, but the bad spots should be easy to see. If you're looking for cookware that looks attractive hanging in your kitchen, this might be your ticket.

I do like some features such as the tapered edges, the weight, the look (when the set was new), and the even heating. But I mainly bought because I wanted quality stainless! Shortly after getting and using the set, I started noticing stains on the stainless steel. Since then they have gotten worse. The quality of the stainless steel used for these pots and pans is horrible. My old set of cheap, single thick stainless, with plastic handles, given to us at our wedding over 20 years ago, is better at not staining than this set. Every single piece of this cookware has stains on it, some worse than others. They look terrible hanging on the pot rack, and the stains will not scrub off.

10125,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,Update 12/23/2012: It rusts,2.0 ,"Updated 12/23/2012: Within a week of first using it, rust has begun to develop on the outside (on the satin finish). There was a very very small amount of water left on it after washing, and it's rusting badly at that spot. To me, this indicates a very cheap steel. NONE of my other pots rust, including older Multi-Clad Pro and All-Clad. This is a bummer. Original review (5 stars): I am amazed at the quality of the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro Stainless. It may even be heavier than my All-Clad 3-ply. Plus the Cuisinart has the curved edge around the rim that All-Clad just started to include on their new products. It makes the pot stronger and also eliminates drips when pouring. The Cuisinart has a brushed stainless finish on the exterior that keeps it from getting scratched, unlike the All-Clad original. The 12 quart stock pot does not have a disc on the bottom. It's just three layers of metal on the bottom and all the way up the sides, much like my All-Clad D5 8 quart casserole. The shape also is more like a casserole than my other stock pots that have high walls. The Cuisinart walls are a little lower, and it's a little wider, which makes it perfect to hold a 4 pound chicken. In my other stock pots, the chicken only would fit legs up, meaning it hit the sides during cooking. The shape of the Cuisinart also makes it perfect for braising meats in the oven. I did not experience any hot spots using it on a gas range. The lid is a little lighter than the All-Clad lids. Both are single-ply stainless, with a handle. The handles on the pots for both the Cuisinart and my All-Clad have rivets, meaning the rivets are visible on the inside of the pot, instead of being tack-welded. I know this bothers some people, but I've never had a problem cleaning either pot. I found the handles for the Cuisinart more comfortable than on my All-Clad pots, because the Cuisinart handles bow out, allowing my hands to stay slightly further away from the pot (a few millimeters). The All-Clad D5 handles bow in slightly towards the pot. I don't know the difference between the MCP66-28 (the older Cuisinart) and the MCP66-28N (this product), because I haven't used older Multiclad Stock pot. If you don't mind paying 5x as much and you don't mind the heavier weight, the All-Clad D5 brushed stock pot is the clear winner. However, the Cuisinart is every bit as good as the new All-Clad 3-ply and better than the original All-Clad, and it's 2 - 3x less money. In my mind, this is the best deal around.",,,13 Dec 2012

This is by far the best cookware I've ever owned. Manufactured very well, looks amazing, cooks like a dream and cleans up easily. It's taken on everything from frying, sauteing, braising, making sauces (tomato based and other) with no issues. If you've not cooked with stainless or are coming back to it, there is a minor learning curve for proper use and care, but there is lots of info out there to help and the end result is definitely worth it.

Heat is evenly distributed and clean really nicely. Only negative, and its not really a problem with them, is that with our cooking we found we need an extra saucepan, as there is a small one, a medium, and a big pot. Would have liked another saucepan a bit larger than the medium included and maybe a very small one for sauces/ gravies, then it would have been perfect.

I have been searching high and low for a nice cookware set (bonus if it had a steamer). I considered the Calphalon 10pc Signature set, the All-Clad 7pc Tri-ply set, and this set. I read reviews from numerous sites, watch countless Youtube videos, and decided to take a gamble on the Cuisinart Multiclad set. Boy, am I glad I did! First of all, this cookware set feels even more comfortable in my petite hands. It's sturdy, has some solid weight to it, and looks beautiful. But how does it cook and clean? Just as great as you can imagine. I learned a great deal on how to cook using stainless steel prior to getting this cookware set and I used my knowledge to the test and the food came out wonderfully. The finish is really beautiful. I hope it continues to look as beautiful as the years go by with proper wash and care. If you are on the fence about this cookware set, I say get it.

But I like to prepare my own meals because I'll rather take charge of my own nutritional health than face the consequences of eating mystery food. I lie: I hated cooking. So, during this awful co-dependent relationship with my kitchen, my pots and pans began to die one by one (they were horrible to began with). The smartest decision I made was to research about decent stainless steel equipment and deciding on these. I enjoy cooking now. It's not something I'll ever be passionate about, but I can live with cooking everyday as long as I have these pots and pans. They look sleek, neat, and reliable--and they are. The food cooks as it should. Great even heat distribution, so no unevenly cooked dishes. Half the oatmeal doesn't stick to the sides. I've even successfully cooked rice on the stove with these pots. Cleaning is extremely easy. Fried eggs don't need to be dosed in oil and painfully scrapped off at the end of the day. And if anything sticks too hard, simply boil some vinegar and scrub lightly. And the rims are beautiful for pouring liquids out of. Form, function, and price point are all excellent. This is what I call quality engineering.",,,22 Mar 2018

Easy to clean and good quality.,5.0 ,"I've been using these a few weeks now and I have yet to have any problems using them or cleaning them. The only time food stuck was when my boyfriend used the frying pan and had the heat too high (he didn't realize how well these conduct heat, for a gas range I don't need it any higher than medium low and he was using medium high). If you have issues with sticking be sure to let the pan heat up before adding any oil or food to it, but don't have the heat too high because a: you will burn your food and b: it will stick. Cleaning has really been a cinch. After cooking in it, let the pan cool down a bit, put some hot water and deglaze the bottom of the pan. I like to just use the utensil i cooked with (not metal) and scrape around the bottom of the pan with the water in it. Within seconds the bottom of the pan is clean of food and the pan just needs to be scrubbed and put away. I do not have a dishwasher so I wash all of these by hand and the people complaining about difficulty cleaning these are ridiculous. In terms of residue on the bottom of the pans that won't come off with soap and water - these are stainless steel. That happens from time to time. I have a stainless steel work top that also gets the same type of residue. It is easy to get off with some vinegar and baking soda, or bartenders friend.",,,12 Mar 2018

Compared with my old aluminum pans they take a little longer to heat but once hot, they use much less power. I didn't think they would make this much difference. We cooked white rice and due to the great seal of the lids, it came out as great as with a rice cooker. You will need to put some healthy fat in the pan like olive oil so that food doesn't stick.

It's definitely not as easy as cooking on non-stick pans, but the heat is consistently spread out. I did have some occasions where food debris was stuck, so I had to soak the pans for a couple of hours before washing it. Another thing would the the solid lids.

10286,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,"Great quality, great price, good design",5.0 ,"I cook for a larger crowd regularly, and I had come to the point of needing a few extra pieces to complement my All-Clad d5 set. However, I was not prepared to pay All-Clad prices a second time round... so I decided to go for this set, which was less for the set than the All-Clad stockpot alone. To be honest, I only realized that there was a 7 piece set after receiving this one, and maybe that was lucky, as I would have ordered the smaller set had I seen it before... but now I am happy to have the 12 set. So, comparing the two sets... - Yes, the All-Clad is better quality. Sturdier, heavier, easier to clean. But, the difference is small, and at this stage, I am not sure it's $600 better. - Once you learn how to cook with stainless steel, both sets perform beautifully. For everyday cooking, I am not seeing much difference between the two. - The Cuisinart one still cleans nicely, even though it might take a bit more soaking for burned-on food. It reacts very nicely to Bar Keeper's friend for more difficult stains. - The shiny inside surface makes me nervous for scratches, but no evidence of such yet. I am sure they will eventually appear, but, honestly, I don't care as much. - The lids are much lighter than the All-Clad ones. Not sure that it matters though. - Compared to my other set, this one seems to have less surface and more height, making it more appropriate if I am cooking smaller quantities - I find myself reaching for it if I am cooking for 1 or 2 people. - It's beautiful. Happy to see it hanging on my rack. The different sizes are the main reason I am happy I ended up buying the 12 piece set, as it gives me more flexibility in choosing the appropriate size for the job at hand. I would think that the Cuisinart version is possibly better than the All-Clad if you are routinely cooking for 1-2 people; the All-Clad may be better if cooking for 3-4. Not that either set couldn't handle any amount of people in that range. For myself, I see that I am reaching for what I thought was going to be my backup set more often than I thought I would. And, even though I can tell the All-Clad is better quality, the difference is not such that would impact my day-to-day cooking. Of course, longevity (my All-Clad set is close to 10 years old with no signs of wear) remains to be seen.",,,16 Feb 2018
10287,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,A Joy to Cook with.,5.0 ,"I requested this skillet as a Christmas gift and based on nearly two months of use, so far I'm finding it meets my needs. I have been using it at least once a week and it cooks well and cleans up nicely - I let the pan cool, soak it, and haven't had to use Bon Ami too often to remove more stuck-on food. The multiclad construction allows the skillet to heat evenly and the food cooks evenly. The only issue I've encountered is due to the unevenness of the burners on my electric stove. I have to move the skillet around a bit on the cooking surface which tilts significantly, which is, of course, the fault of the stove top, not the skillet. There has been a marked improvement in the meals I've prepared using this skillet over the older, not terribly good pans it's replaced. The long handle is angled well, stays cool for handling, and makes it comfortable to maneuver the skillet during cooking and serving. The helper handle is a great and necessary addition for lifting and moving the pan. The lid is designed well and fits well. I'm pleased with the size, features, maintenance and functionality of this pan. Good price, good product. It's a joy to cook with it.",,,16 Feb 2018

This pan continues the tradtion, and in fact its lead has grown in my view. I bought the Calphalon Tri-Ply 10"" pan a few weeks before this one; I was disappointed at how cheap-feeling they have become -- the aluminum middle layer looks to be barely 1-1.5 mm thinck, and the pan weighs just 842g (29.7 oz) -- although it performs reasonably well. I needed a 2nd 10"" pan, as I'm eliminating non-stick entirely from my cookware collection, so I ordered this one from Amazon. The Cuisinart pan looks gorgeous, and feels as hefty as I would expect. It weighed in at 1,116g (39.37 oz), 33% heavier than the Calphalon! The aluminum layer looks to be more than twice as thick (looking at the outer edge, and the pan performs exactly as its Multiclad Pro siblings in my collection do -- perfectly. As with other pans in this line, including saucepans, the pouring lip is a welcome improvement over, say, the All-Clad pans with no lip. The handle is also easier on the hands when lifting the pan overhand (which I do because it's more natural for me, although it uses tennis-player muscles that a lot of people don't have). Overall, a great pan at a terrific price. I see no reason whatsoever to spend all that extra money for the ""big brands"". FYI, I've generall had no issues with quality control for these MCP pans.

They heat evenly and cleans easily as long as you use them properly, also the selection in this set is great for a small household (2-3 people). I have to admit that the look is a little utilitarian, not as nice as All-Clad, but actually more functional since all pots and pans in this set have a rolled lip for drip-free pouring, while in All-Clad very few have it. As a side note, in some other reviews it was mentioned that the rivets are easily corroded which worried me a little before purchasing. However, I can happily say that it's not the case any more for the current batch/version. All rivets on the pan (except the steamer insert and all lids) are now stainless steel instead of aluminum -- I guess Cuisinart listened to the reviews and made the improvement.

10344,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,Great professional cookware for home use - beautiful!,5.0 ,"I bought this set two months ago and have waited a bit to post a review to make sure I had a chance to live with it for a while. We had just purchased a new stove with true convection oven and ceramic radiant burner cooktop. On reading the manual, I found that most of my stovetop cookware was not recommended for use with this cooktop. My pots and skillets either had ridges on the bottom, painted surfaces, or both. Even the copper-bottom set I have had for 40 years was not recommended for use with high heat. Not willing to take a chance on ruining the cooktop, I decided to invest in a whole new set of cookware, and spent a lot of time online reading professional chef websites and anywhere else I could find reviews for the recommended products for my new stove. The Cuisinart Multi-clad Pro products consistently scored high. There are similar Cuisinart products that are stainless steel, but are not multi-clad. I made my final decision after reading an article dated March, 2017 on Best Cookware for Glass-top Stoves at a website called onthegas.org. This article gave their top five picks, and the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro set was at the top of the list. On receiving the cookware, I was impressed with the beautiful appearance and the weight of the cookware. It simply looks and feels like professional cookware. There are many products that cost more - much more. But I am cooking for my family, and considering the excellent warranty offered on this product, I felt it was a great buy for the price. It heats quickly and evenly. The helper handles remain cool, and it cleans up beautifully. Some reviewers have mentioned spotting on the inside surfaces, but this cleans up with a little vinegar, and even so, does not impair the functionality of the cookware. I gave away the cookware that was not recommended, except for the Revere Ware copper bottom set I received as a wedding gift in the 70's - it's okay to use as long as you don't use high heat. I have since purchased a couple of other pieces in this line and I am just as happy with them. I needed a shallow roasting pan to use with the convection roast/bake oven setting. I got the large lasagna pan with roasting rack. Since the Multiclad Pro set did not include a nonstick skillet, I ordered the 10-inch non-stick skillet. I plan to buy the tri-ply nonstick double griddle - not in the Multiclad line, but similar. This cookware is a joy to use. I have always considered myself a pretty great cook, but the results I am getting with my new stove and cookware have really upped my game and I am having fun trying new recipes and techniques.",,,21 Jan 2018

If you have trouble with your hands be aware that this cookware is a bit on the heavy side especially the larger pieces when full of food.

I especially like the large deep skillet that comes with this. I have discovered that things don't stick if I spray the pan with a cooking spray like Pam first. Some folks have had no sticking problems so I'm guessing it's just me and my cook-top runs a bit hot.

10404,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,Performs way beyond my expectations!,5.0 ,"After much research on cookware and asking my chef friend, who recommended All Clad (which was too expensive), I decided that the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro would be the best choice. It has the tri-ply construction, stainless steel with aluminum core which also goes up the sides. The lesser expensive sets are only tri-ply on the bottom, which truly makes a huge difference in even and thorough heating and cooking. The set arrived and not only is it nice to look at, the cooking is phenomenal! When I read reviews that this cookware would make a difference in how food tastes, I did not believe it. So, game on! I made soup stock and it is the best stock I have ever made! When my boys commented on how great it was - I knew that the cookware does make a difference. I was hesitant to cook eggs because of some of the reviews saying that they stuck. If you follow some basic rules, the cookware performs outstandingly. The eggs were perfect and nothing (not even a smidgeon) stuck to the pan. Here are the key rules I am following with great success: 1. Never heat above a 5 on a 10 point scale for heat. (half of your top setting) I promise - you will be able to sear and brown and saute like a champ. 2. Heat the pot/pan BEFORE adding butter or oil. This is the key to not having anything stick to the cookware. (for eggs, I used butter - amazing results! I was going to buy a couple of non-stick pans for eggs but do not need to with these results) 3. I do NOT put mine in the D/W. I need to get some Barkeepers Friend for the few spots, but so far, they clean up beautifully. For those who have posted negative reviews or had bad outcomes, this cookware requires a change in cooking styles/methods and finesse to achieve successful results. I truly believe that if you follow the rules posted, you will be love this cookware! (As well as saving lots of money over All clad or other professional quality cookware.)

Bottom line: This cookware makes me want to be a better cook.,4.0 ,"I like reviews by people who have used the product for a few months and this is one of those. We have been using this Cuisinart MultiClad Pro set for almost one year. This cookware is lovely; it is nice and heavy and holds the heat very well. I loved the way the pots looked right out of the box! In addition, the skillet handles stay cool (but the lid handles do not). However, you must read the care and use instructions! A LOT LOT LOT of butter or oil is necessary to prevent the food from hopelessly sticking to the pan and this is my biggest complaint: clean-up can be a challenge if you want the cookware to look nice. Any little food sticking to the pan after cooking was a challenge to remove although soaking for a few minutes is helpful. I found that Bar Keepers Friend (with a soft sponge) works better than the recommended Bon Ami. The Bar Keepers Friend even works on greasy pots. Even if you are only cooking green beans in water, you might be tempted to simply rinse out the pot but it will not be clean enough.

10412,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,Absolutely love this set!,5.0 ,"I decided to wait for a while to write this review as I wanted to use them for at least a few weeks prior to rating and reviewing. Keep in mind this is my first set of stainless steel cookware I've ever used so I can't really compare them to other stainless steel sets. I've only used numerous types/styles of non-stick sets. Teflon, ceramic, ""green pan"", copper chef, etc. (I've never actually BOUGHT a set of cookware until I bought these, all of the others have been gifts of some sort). I was trying to decide between these or a set that Calphalon were heavily discounting at the time (a set with copper on the outside, stainless on the inside, aluminum core), but out of all the comparisons and other reviews, I chose these instead mainly because the copper would most likely tarnish and get unevenly ugly. Also America's Test Kitchen tested sauce pans. The winner being All-clad of course was WELL out of my price range. Their next recommendation though was the Cuisinart Multiclad unlimited, and I figured those should perform similar to these. Pros Stainless steel - with care will last a lifetime and more Heats very evenly and quickly The tapered rim really does make pouring MUCH easier and practically drip free (I always have a paper towel handy regardless) Cooked eggs without sticking (yeah, you read that right) Cooking is much more predictable Cons The cookware do ""stain"" but can be removed Must be very diligent with proper preheating and not overheating Parts of the cookware is a high mirror polish (more on why I put this as a con later) Could be sensitive to temperature shock (but then again, MOST if not all cookware is) First, I'll tackle the cons ""Stains"" can occur on the cooking surface, especially if you get some stuck food (some food sticking is normal, it's called fond, don't be discouraged by it). After giving it a good soap and water bath with a plastic scrub sponge I've noticed light colored ""whitish"" marks on the cookware. Honestly this isn't a problem, but it does trigger my OCD to want the pans to look clean. Nothing a little Bon Ami/Bar Keepers Friend can't fix. Just don't really recommend doing this often as these are minor abrasives. This leads me to... Mirror like finish in spots. I honestly wish all of the surface had the brushed look to it. Once you use Bon Ami/Bar Keepers friend on the upper parts of the cooking surface or elsewhere, you'll get swirl marks. This is just once again my OCD of wanting to keep my brand new set looking brand new. They WILL scratch and get swirls and other stuff. But the mirror finish only makes it that much worse. It obviously won't change the performance of the cookware. Preheating/overheating. These pans can heat up QUICK (ymmv depending on your stove type, mine is electric with exposed element), even on medium. Because of this you really need to make sure you aren't overheating the pan while preheating. Overheat can/will lead to badly stuck/burned food. This is going to be typical of pretty much any multiclad/all clad stainless steel cookware. If you don't like this, stick with hard anodized or something of the sort. Temperature shock. Honestly this should go without saying, but really the last thing you want to do is go from cooking to putting this under cold water. I've seen reviews (from pros using this specific cookware) where they have done this and the pan was fine. But really, you seriously run the risk of warping ANY cookware doing this. Just.....don't do it. Time for the pros Stainless steel - Really, there's not much to say here. Because the outer and inner surfaces are stainless steel, as long as you're not abusing the pans, they'll last forever. There isn't a non-stick surface that slowly turns turns into a reason for throwing it out. Heats evenly/quickly - The fact that these have an aluminum core sandwiched by stainless steel really helps these pans heat up quick and even. I've made frittata and numerous other things and get a pretty consistent cook throughout the entire thing (it would help if my stove top were more level but there's little I can do about that without replacing the entire top, the whole stove is level). Tapered rim - I've poured out sauces, soups bacon grease, etc. It all pours out really easy and smooth. I can't 100% comment on it being drip free as I always have a paper towel or something handy to wipe the edge. Force of habit. Cooked eggs without sticking - Yeah I've read numerous reviews saying that eggs stick like crazy to these. It's the one thing that made me wait 2 weeks prior to even think about cooking eggs, let alone over easy eggs on these. I can safely say that eggs swirl around on these pans just as good as any perfectly new non-stick pan. Granted you need to make sure you heat the pan just right and prep it. I haven't tried putting eggs in with JUST butter yet but I would imagine it would work. Usually I'll put a about an 1/8th of a teaspoon of canola oil in the pre heated pan and use a paper towel to cover the surface and the sides, let it sit for a few seconds, then put a little butter in the bottom. I have yet to have any eggs stick at all. In fact, I threw out my old 8"" non-stick I kept around specifically for eggs. Cooking predictable - Because the pans heat evenly and they're super conductive, cooking because so much more predictable and you use much less heat. On my old pans, I'd usually cook most things on medium high. I've found medium with these has been equivalent. Polenta, rice, etc all cook really nicely because you can just set the heat to low and just let it go. At first I was a bit worried about the lids not being see through (as I've always had glass lids) but now I've come to not care. All in all every single time I cook with this cookware, I always find myself saying ""I Love these pans!!!"". I have yet to have food ""stick"" to them. At least to the point where it's destroying the food. The only thing I haven't tried are fish and pancakes, but I would imagine pancakes would stick regardless. If you're having a problem with all your food sticking, you're doing it wrong. You're most likely over heating the pan. Watch some youtube vids about proper use of stainless steel cookware and you should be able to figure it out.",,,17 Dec 2017

Another nice feature is the pouring lip, which the French version of these pots didn't have. Nice, even, spill proof pouring every time.

10446,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,"Happy with my purchase, hoping this will be the last roasting pan I ever have to buy.",4.0 ,"Have tested this twice so far since I got it. Does exactly what I want it to do! Roasted a 3-pound chicken when I first got it, then a 12-ish pound turkey this week--all good. I didn't make gravy after roasting the chicken (why?? Must have forgotten) but I did after the turkey and OH HECK YES I was able to put this right across two (electric) stove burners and scrape those drippings up just fine. The chicken looked hilariously puny in this size of a pan--to be honest, so did the turkey, a bit--but that makes me confident that I can use it for a 20+ pound behemoth next Thanksgiving if I want. Other relevant thoughts: -I watched VERY CAREFULLY for the pitting issues some reviewers mentioned. Nothing so far! I haven't used anything acidic in it, just in case, but I will at some point and adjust this review if needed. There were, of course, fork marks from where I made gravy, but that happens to my mixing bowls too and has never escalated into an issue. Again, if it does, I'll update. -The rack doesn't quite look/feel as high quality as the pan, but so far has worked just fine. Either the rack or the pan itself is warped (gotta be the rack, or if not it's only a slight flaw and has yet to cause any issues)--it wobbles within the pan. :/ Annoying (and the reason this review is 4 stars instead of 5), but hasn't caused any half-cooked poultry to fling itself across my kitchen, so no worries. -Yes, it's dishwasher safe! I was worried about that. Ran it through on the top shelf because that's where it fit best, used the ""pots and pans"" setting with my usual detergent tab, and it came out fine. No clue yet how that will work out in the long term, over years or decades, but so far so good. The rack went on the bottom shelf and came out SPOTLESS, which was nice--part of why I got rid of my old pan/rack combo was because I was still scrubbing turkey schmutz out of that thing a week after Thanksgiving last year. -If you're used to smaller or lower quality pans, know that this is much heavier and that it may take a few uses to get accustomed to the size and angle of the handles. You'll probably be fine--I have moderate arthritis in my hands and was still able to move it easily--but take the weight into consideration for the first few uses. That being said, the handles are VERY useful--makes it easy to get a firm, secure grip. -I have no idea why, at the time I'm posting this, the Amazon price is showing up at $121. I paid $60-something a month or so ago. At the price I paid, this is a good investment in functionality and size. Any higher and I'd be a little dubious, but your mileage may vary (I'm coming from a lower middle class perspective here--if spending $100+ on a roasting pan is normal for you, go for it). You're unlikely to find it for much less than I paid, but if you do, jump on it. Good pan, worth getting.",,,24 Nov 2017

I'm somewhat baffled by reviews that complain about sticking. A few points to keep in mind: These pans heat quickly and with less heat than cheaper pans. A setting of 6 (of 12) on my large burners will cause canola and olive oil to smoke. I now treat 6 as ""high"" heat. 5 works fine for searing meats. Follow the instructions. Heat the pan, then add oil. When the oil has heated up, add the food. Level your stove so oil will sit evenly in the pan. When the pans have cooled (touchable), I put in hot water with a squirt of dishwashing soap,and let it sit for a few minutes, then clean with the ""hard"" side of a no-scratch sponge. If anything is left, a bit of Bar Keeper's Friend cuts right through it in seconds and polishes the surface nicely. It's so easy, I never put them in the dishwasher. I have had some minor warping with the 12"" skillet and 5.5 qt saute pan, neither of which are included in this set. They still seem to cook well. No issue with the pots or smaller pans.

However, it would still be wise to read the suggestions provided in the product box. Do not use high heat, and definitely don't let the pot dry out while on the stove. This will discolor the bottom. With multiclads, you don't need to blast the fire all the way up. I just use medium heat max, and it still heats up fast. This pot is dishwasher safe, but hand washing is still preferred to avoid damaging the surface over time. Overall, I like this product. I use it to make ramen, boil water, make small batches of stock, etc. It is well balanced and won't tip over to the side like some cheap pots tend to do. The handle is solid and doesn't wobble. The lid handle can get a bit hot so I just use a kitchen towel to lift it up. The handle is big enough anyway that having a glove on (or a towel) shouldn't be an issue.

I have a flat electric stovetop, and the lower quality pots I had just took ages to heat up - boiling water for pasta was such a chore. This set clearly has vastly superior thermal conductivity, and heats up approximately a billion times more quickly (potentially slightly exaggerated, but probably not much). Everything is also nice shiny stainless steel - looks and feels really high quality. The one unfortunate thing I have noticed is that the lids do get pretty warm - I definitely need to use an oven mitt to hold the lids if they've been on warm pots or pans for too long.

I called Le Creuset and they recommended Bar Keepers Friend, Funny how this pan doesn't need that to stay clean and the quality of the Cuisinart is just as good if not better. The handle on the Le Creuset is better but that's about it. Given the choice after owning both is that the Cuisinart is better to cook with and therefore the better choice.

10493,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,Best buy in cookware,5.0 ,"Before purchasing this set I had been using AllClad tri ply stainless, then AllClad copper core cookware for several years. This set cooks every bit as well as those did. Despite the fact that this set costs less than some of the individual knives I keep in the kitchen, I wouldn’t trade them for much of anything. That said, here are my only critical comments: The 8” omelet pan is nearly useless, it’s really only well suited to a fried egg or two, and for that non stick or cast iron is a more suitable material. I replaced this with a non-stick for these tasks. The handles on the 6qt stock pot are a little thinner and less comfortable to hold when the pot is full than the AC version, which is more rounded/beveled. The metal lids are compact, durable, and light, but glass lids would be helpful at times. There are replacements that will fit of course, and I will be using them for a few of the pieces. The 2.5qt pot is too small to prepare many sides for even just two people in. For example if making mashed potatoes and steaming broccoli, you’d have to use the 4qt and the 6qt stock pot (which is overkill for the task) as the 2.5qt couldn’t handle either. At first I thought the steamer basket was silly, since I had one already and didn’t feel the need for another. That said I find myself using the one included in the set and am very pleased with it. All in all, I think with a few specific additions (a non stick fry pan, a glass lid or two, and some supplemental pieces to fit your family size and cooking needs) this is unquestionably the most sensible cookware set available. At the time that we purchased these a kitchen store nearby was liquidating stock. Some AC pieces were on sale for 50-60% off. This was still a smarter buy and I’m glad we got these instead. Other than the handles on the 6qt pot feeling thinner, there isn’t a single thing that separates these from AC in the hand, or on the burner.",,,19 Oct 2017

10512,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,Major kitchen upgrade,5.0 ,"These are some quality items. They're heavy and feel solidly built. Waaaay cheaper than All Clad, which is why I settled on this brand. So far I've used the steamer, the large pot, the small pot, and the sauté pan, making a variety of foods like custard, gravy, pasta, pasta sauce, veggies. I haven't had any problems. I did quite a bit of research about stainless steel before using them, though. Most people who write negative reviews clearly just have no idea how to cook with them and try using them like cheap nonstick pans. It seems like only a minority of reviewers actually received something defective. I feel like I shouldn't have to include the following information, but obviously it's necessary as people aren't doing the research themselves: The trick is to let the skillets or sauté pan heat up completely, then add butter, swirl it around, then add whatever you're cooking. The food should not stick. Mine didn't. If you're boiling water, let the water come to a full boil before adding salt, otherwise the bottom of the pan could become pitted from the salt. Try not to use metal utensils as these will scratch the stainless steel. I use wooden and silicone utensils with mine. These are dishwasher safe, but if the pans are knocking around against other dishes, this could also lead to scratching. Some discoloration can occur from food sticking and burning (which, again, shouldn't happen if you're using the above method). Some can occur from chemicals in the water wherever you're living (you probably can't help that one, but it's still not the pan's fault). Some can occur on the bottom of the pan if you're using extra high heat (I've never had to go above a medium/medium-high heat setting). If plain old dish soap isn't cutting it, try bar keepers friend and a heavy duty sponge like Jetz-Scrubs, both available on Amazon. Yes, people, it requires some work, some effort. But so does good cooking. It requires some time and attention, and if you just want to cobble something together on the stove and walk away and leave it there, these probably are not for you. But if you want to take your cooking to the next level, then these are worth it. These feel like they'll last a long time, and from other reviewers it looks like they do. Take care of your pots and pans and you shouldn't have a problem.",,,05 Oct 2017

Note, the patent for allclads technology has ran out, so you can get similar types (e.g., via cuisinart).

Big family, holidays, guests over, you'll love the extra room. Used this 6 times now and zero torsion. Hand washes effortlessly and the coatings are excellent. My GE 5 burner cook top came with a drop in, super heavy, cast iron griddle insert where you remove that left side grate and insert the fitted custom cast iron one. Cast iron is such a PITA that I prefer this griddle, plus the custom cast iron insert doesn't have much runoff catch ability and a pound of melted bacon grease would be running all over the top of your cooktop! This griddle catches it all ""easily"". The heat distribution between burners 14 inches apart was not perfect, BUT is so close that the point is moot. Anyone complaining about the minor deviation from perfect heat distribution would waste their money on any item of this kind. Physics just doesn't permit it. If concerned, just flip the food item to the warmer area when flipping time comes. I had hash browns spread out evenly, and used 32 ounces, entire package, 5/8"" deep. Fit fine. Again, not to be redundant, but the center of the pan cooked those hash browns just fine, albeit at just a few degrees less. Pre-heat it good as the directions state, and my GE Profile needed even a little more time to pre-heat but there is a wider distance between the burner and the top of the cooking grate than my Fisher & Paykel, which was closer. Holds the whole pound of thick bacon nicely, and a wee bit crowded with the entire pound of thinner bacon, but was fine.",,,19 Sep 2017

10578,cuisinart mcp193-18n multiclad pro stainless steel 3-quart saucepan with cover,40.35,"A great pan, but a bit costly",5.0 ,"I have several pieces of high-end cookware with stainless steel interiors. They are fantastic to cook with, but there are a few items like eggs that are far easier to cook in a non-stick pan, so I keep a single 12"" pan around just for that. Non-stick pans won't last, even if you are careful to use silicone tools in them, hand-wash them, and most importantly, never overheat them. If you do all of these things, they will last about a year, then start sticking. A little a first, then more as time goes on. I push mine to two years, then replace it with a new one, same size and model. I chose this one because it is multi-layer. It has stainless on the outside with enough carbon in it to work with an induction stovetop. Induction stoves use a strong magnetic field to heat up the pan itself rather than the burner underneath it. They are still relatively rare and expensive, but they work very well and are gaining in popularity. They also require a magnetic pan to work, so this one fits the bill. It will also work very well on all other stove types, of course. The inside layer is thicker and aluminum, which conducts heat much better and more evenly than steel. This makes the pan respond quickly to the burner temperature and helps eliminate hot spots. Finally, the inside layer is layer of non-magnetic stainless coated with a very good quality nonstick Teflon coating. The non-stick coating isn't great for searing, and you won't get any fond with this, but it makes a very forgiving surface for an omelet or thin crepe. It is a great pan, and I've decided it is worth it to me to pay the price for it even though I know it won't last. I like that it responds and is constructed similarly to my other pans, so it isn't much of an adjustment when I use it. It is definitely on the high end of how much you should pay for a non-stick pan. If you want a better value and do not have an induction stove, I highly recommend this one: Farberware Restaurant Pro Aluminum Nonstick 12-Inch Skillet, Silver . It is half the price and still excellent. The Farberware will not work on an induction stove, isn't as heavy, and does not have the stainless layer on the bottom. However, it is a great buy for the money and makes more sense financially given the disposable nature of non-stick pans. If the price of the Cuisinart continues to rise, my next replacement will be the Farberware. Recommended, even though it is on the pricey side. Sean Logue, 2017",,,03 Sep 2017

I figured I would order this, decide which one I liked more and give one to my sone who is moving out for the first time. The Calphalon was hard used nad coupld have been taken care of better but teaching three kids (and my wife) to cook put it to it's test, so was showing it's age and I was looking for something 'prettier' for when we had people over. Out of the box: - Everythign was packaged well (both original packaging and the Amazon packaging). - The individual pieces were heavy (which I was worried they would seem flimsy, totally not the case). Welds are sturdy for handles and finish was perfect. - Ever single piece seemed to be one size smaller that what I had with my old set. The sizes should be fine for an average family but if you often cook for 10 or more, plan on ordering some of the larger pieces. - The stickers on the lids were annoying to remove but not a big deal. Cooking: - Eveything works great with my ceramic cookrange. Heating is even. It does seem to retain heat better than my old set and if you're going to turn it down right before something boils over you're going to be a few minutes too late ;-) - I do use my cast iron for searing meat and cooking eggs, so I can't comment on how it browns.meat. - I have not gone from range to oven with these yet but don't see it being an issue. - Handles remain cool which is great. Cleaning - No issues so far with cleaning them and them looking like new! I am on a well with a lot of minerals so water spots keep me busy. I have not run them through the dishwasher and probably never will. Overall: - My son is enjoying the old Calphalon set in his apartment! I think my wife really likes these too but just wont admit it. You may need to buy a few larger pieces depending on your cooking style (12 Qt stockpot was a must have, it's wider and taller than the 8Qt that comes with this set). I have a few other pieces on my wish list that I'll be ordering over the next couple of months, but I must admit I'm surprised that a set that cost half as much as the Calphalon set performs as well as this does!

RIP OFF.,1.0 ,"I do not believe the item being sold here is the authentic Viviscal Extra Strength Pill. I read the reviews before purchasing, which questioned the authenticity of this product, but chose to ignore it since the vendor was viviscal. BIG MISTAKE. While packaging may change, and the items with older packaging are commonly reduced in price; i do not believe this is the same product as what is sold from other vivscal retailers. First, after taking this product for 3.5 weeks, I saw no change in hair loss. Second, after taking this product for 3.5 weeks I developed a horribly dry/rashy scalp. It was unbearably dry, flaky, and itchy. I decided to stop taking viviscal. My scalp eventually recovered. believing this product not to be the real deal, I purchased it at Target for $35.00. The packing is almost exactly the same but as mentioned in a previous review, the lot numbers are different. Amazon viviscal is alpha numerical, and targets in just numerical. The pill packaging is different which could fall under the packaging my vary description. The biggest and most disturbing difference is in the pill itself. The pills from target which is a verified Viviscal retailer, are denser, a totally different color and have a grainier look to it. This made me wonder what did I buy from Amazon? The pills look and smell different despite the Supplement Facts being EXACTLY the same. I have no idea what I was ingesting believing it to be Viviscal, and I would strongly recommend that NO ONE buys this from Amazon.

I am otherwise very healthy and athletic, drink little alcohol. The only thing that had changed was taking this supplement! He said to stop taking it and we will repeat the bloodwork in a few months. Low and behold, my levels were back to normal! So just a word of caution to all you women who want super long hair without extensions (like me!) and think it's harmless to try this - think again! Nothing is worth potential permanent damage to your liver!!!!! After researching, I think it could be the Niacin but am not certain.

However, the next box and the next box came and the color of the tablet was different. My hair hasn't grown as quickly.

Have been battling an unusual severe case of acne for the past 6 months. I just figured out that it was Viviscal so I immediately stopped taking it. Guess what? Acne problem totally disappeared, but not without leaving an extensive amount of damage to my skin because of scarring! I am 47yo with absolutely no history of acne what so ever, which is why my sudden outbreak was emotionally taxing and disturbing. I didn't imagine that it was Viviscal because people were telling me it was hormonal, even seen a dermatologist for the first time in my life, and they prescribed hormonal meds. However something was telling me that it wasn't that, it had to be some sort of change that caused it. So after many months of fighting this issue and becoming withdrawn and depressed, I read the reviews and noticed that I had the exact same bad side affects as many others, and stopped taking these vitamins. My breakouts stopped 2 days later and now I'm hoping to find a way to heal the scars...emotional and physical! Wish I could go back in time to when my skin was scar free:-( There are other odd symptoms I experienced along with acne: brain fog, insomnia, social anxiety, rapid aging, eye wrinkles, thinning skin, dark under eye circles, and weight gain (I'm a size 2, naturally fit, also work out 2-3 times a week. Noticed an increase of stubborn fat around my belly, arms, and thighs that has been difficult to remove.) FYI...I bought my first 3 month supply through Viviscal and second 3 months from Amazon. The issue occurred after a month of taking it, so I would say that regardless of where you purchase the product, it will more than likely have the same affect since my issue started during the supply I received from the manufacturer. Buyer BEWARE! UPDATE 5/17/17 - Have not had a menstrual cycle in 6mos so my estrogen is out of whack and for a very fit woman that workout 3 times a week, my muscles are servery atrophy so my skin is flabby and hanging from my bones. My face is still drooping too. I've ALWAYS looked 10yrs younger, and now I'm looking much much older. Very recognizable, depressing, and extremely embarrassing because people are probably wondering if I've fallen ill or is on drugs. I'm hoping that my body will go back to normal, but I'm not so sure being that I'm older and I don't really know how much damage to my ovaries have been done. I've worked very hard over the years to stay fit, trim, beautiful skin, and emotionally stable. Taking viviscal took my appearance, mental strength, and happiness away within a few months, and for God knows how long it takes for me to recover...IF EVER! Trying to stay optimistic, but because of all the side effects, I'm kind of skeptical of getting back to normal 100%. I already still have ugly scars on my face from the acne that I've been able to cover up with makeup, but this body issue is still lingering because my hormones are still wacky. I've never prayed for a menstrual cycle to come more than I now do everyday. Still nothing yet, just slight feelings of menstrual cramps as if it's going to come, but nothing ever produces. Remaining hopeful though:-/ Do not, I repeat...DO NOT risk your health for 100 extra strands of hair. It didn't even work that well for my hair. I know I'm going on and on, but this is strictly to benefit YOU, and not have you go through what I'm going through. So...here's another thing. Rob Kardashian is/was a spokesperson for this brand, which is one of the reasons I gave it a try. Well please google his name with Viviscal and watch his appearance on a morning show promoting this product. Pay close attention to his appearance, how bubbly and optimistic he sounded, the whole bit. Then LOOK AT HIM TODAY! Broke, broken spirit, mentally unstable (in my opinion), depressed and very overweight. Is there a connection? Sounds like my symptoms, only that he doesn't have a uterus so he can't complain about not having a menstrual cycle. I NEVER rant or write reviews, but this time I had to, and will continue to update this review as I make progress (hopefully) so I can help others who may be going through the same thing. Right now (after about 3 weeks of discontinued use of Viviscal), I am in my first week of taking pure organic wheatgrass juice to detox and get rid of any heavy metals that may have been in the SHARK within Viviscal, and I just started taking Estrotone to aid in getting my menstrual cycle back on track, along with with other multi-vitamins. I work out DAILY, but nothing is working with rebuilding my muscle mass, which is why I'm so very scared right now that this may not be reversible. But again, I'm not giving up hope!!! It may take just as long for me to feel normal again as it has taken for me to realize this is what has been contaminating me body (around 8 months). I pray it doesn't take that long():-) I hope Viviscal doesn't read this and think about sending goons after me, but in case they do, I've already set up a protective circle around me. Lol (I'm really serious). But what they CAN send is a CHECK with a lot of zeros behind a healthy number for all of the pain, suffering, and mental stress that I'm going through. Have been in GREAT SHAPE until now...can't even believe this is happening!",,,28 Apr 2017

I will say customer service with this company is good. After reading reviews about authenticity, I emailed them with the lot number of my product and expiration date and they were able to verify that my batch was genuine. The shark ingredient is controversial, but I read on a blog that someone emailed the company & they claimed it is harvested from a non-endangered species of shark, that the cartilage is not from the fin & is a by-product of the fishing process. Also that the mercury is filtered out. Take that as you will. But I do believe it may be something in the AminoMar that caused my side effects, as the other ingredients in the pill are relatively harmless. Something in the pull seems to mess with your hormones.

But my local CVS stopped stocking it, so I went ahead and ordered from here. Then CVS.com had it back in stock online and I ordered a second box from there. So I was able to compare the two boxes. The lot numbers were almost identical (only the last digit was different) and the external packaging and inserts were identical, as were the pills. Now, onto the product itself. This has made a huge difference for me. I've had thinning problems for a while, but in September, suddenly it got much worse. The thinning was mainly at the temples and my part. I started googling and found reviews of this online. I've had good luck with various supplements in the past, so I gave it a shot. It says 3-6 months before you notice a difference, but after six weeks, the shedding in the shower was minimal (it had been two 1-inch hairballs with each wash). I'm just starting month 4 and my hair noticeably thicker. Before, you could see my scalp at the temples and now there's hair! I'll keep going with 2 tablets a day until I hit 6 months and then see what happens if I dial it back to 1. But this has really worked for me. I asked my dermatologist about it and he'd never heard of it and recommended minoxidil instead. I tried that for about a week, but it was a mess. Then I read reports online of people having premature aging issues with it, most likely because it gets on your pillow and if your face touches it, you're essentially applying it to your face where it can damage the collagen. So Viviscal is the answer for me, at least right now. Highly recommend! UPDATE: Well, it's stopped working. After taking it religiously for a year, my hair started shedding again, only worse.

10918,"viviscal extra strength hair nutrient tablets, 90-tablets",40.35,Developing bad acne along the jawline after 2 months,3.0 ,"I've been on this for about 4 months now and have not noticed any changes with my hair. I told myself I would give it 6 months before deciding whether or not to continue this, but I don't know if I'll make it that long. I seem to be one of the unlucky few who has developed acne from this, and in searching these reviews, it's always in the same jawline area. Some background: I am acne-prone and have always had oily skin, but now in my 30s, I've had it under control with a good skincare regime. However, about 2 months into this product, I started developing large painful cystic acne around my mouth and along my jawline. It's very gross! I've never had cystic acne in my life; just small zits or blackheads/whiteheads. After about a month of 2 or 3 large zits, I thought my body was finally used to it, but then instead of large zits, in the same jawline area, I'm now getting hard clusters of closed comedones. It takes weeks for them develop a blackhead for me to extract or a tiny whitehead for me to pop. It's awful. I'm changing up my skincare to see if that helps, but since the cause is internal (the Viviscal), I'm afraid that the only thing that would help would be to stop taking the pills. I'm going to tough it out for 2 more months and see. UPDATE: I'm only taking 1 pill a week to use up the last pack I have. My skin has gotten SO MUCH BETTER. Totally not worth it and I did not notice any significant changes to my hair. I'm suspicious of the over-the-top positive reviews on this product and have notice a pattern where if a negative or even slightly critical review is left, then the next few reviews left are glowing to try and bury the negative review. I feel like they have a very good marketing team on a product that only works on a small number of people.",,,02 Feb 2017

I hate to go negative...but I feel like I must share my story. It's possible this was just a coincidence, but I am a relatively healthy person and I got very sick during the same time I was taking this supplement. My legs from knee down became very swollen and my knee joints were extremely achy and painful! I was 44 but felt like I was 94! I went to the Dr. during this time (it lasted about 2 1/2 months--the same time I was taking this) and got tested for possible immune problems (hypothyroid, RA, Lupus, etc.) and they didn't find anything wrong with me. I quit taking this supplement and my 'mystery illness' cleared up within weeks. My hair did grow a bit, but not where I needed it to. It only grew at the back, nothing in the front where my thinnest areas were. My husband reviewed the package insert with me and he questioned where the shark cartilage is sourced from. After doing research, we found it's likely from China which leaves me wondering what kind of environment the sharks swam in and how was their cartilage harvested? I won't go into details here, but PLEASE do your own research and then decide for yourself if you can support this practice or put shark's cartilage in your body.",,,31 Jan 2017

I don't have a lot of hair and my scalp is visible. I've taken hair vitamins to make my hair thicker and those didn't work. I did plenty of research on this product as it is pricey. After the great reviews I read, I decided to invest and try the product. I really wanted to love it. I imagined myself having thick gorgeous hair within 6 months (I am more interested in thickness than length). I was so hopeful I never missed a pill and took it at the same time every single day. In the 6 months I took this product, I didn't notice much of a difference but I decided to finish the recommend course to give my hair time to grow. I do see a small amount of baby hairs but I'm not exactly sure if they grew because of the product. My hair was also greasier and my body hair grew at a faster rate. My nails also grew faster. After the 6 months, I reached out to their customer service to see if I could take the product for a few more months and was advised to take 1 supplement a day for 2-3 months and observe if my hair stayed the same and to see my primary healthcare giver to check to see if there was any underlying cause at play (I have already seen my doctor and nothing is wrong). I decided to stop taking this product and began taking biotin 10,000 mcg. I am hopeful this will help. Best of luck to anyone researching this product. I hope it works for you!",,,25 Jan 2017

My boyfriend says I need to blog more, so hair (here) goes. I am a Jamaican with natural kinky hair. Nothing special, my hair is about neck length. Hair care routine - none; and no I don't sleep in satin head piece, or comb or plait my hair in any protective style before bed. I am too tired at night for all of that. I just go to sleep. So I thought I should care for my hair more, as the once a week shampooing and the occasional Castro oil and jojoba oil mix alone would not help me to achieve my hair goal. My hair goal - shoulder length, incredibly thick natural hair. Think Diana Ross. So I began taking Viviscal tablets after having done some research on the product. I have been taking two Viviscal tablets twice daily for about 9 months now. The changes to my hair during this time are as follows: Months 1 to 3 nothing; my hair was shredding due to an improper Castro oil and coconut oil mix, Viviscal did not stop the shredding. Six months later I did not see any changes to my hair's length or thickness. Shredding continued. I however liked the way it look; my hair started to shiny and so continued to take the tablets. Besides I was not expecting overnight results. The benefits reportedly would appear six months and beyond. In months 7th to 9th, I began renovating my kitchen (January 2014). I am a creature of habit. My habit is to sit at the dinner table and sometime during dinner take my Viviscal tablets. At the time of my kitchen renovation I could not find a plate to eat in and as such seldom sat at my dinner table for dinner. So I did not take my tablets for 2 months, which by the way was now packed away in a carton box long with my dishes. What happen to my hair? Nothing. My hair did not start or stop growing, neither did it looked better or worse. (In my opinion). It looked the same way it did when I was taking Viviscal months earlier. I was about to stop future deliveries of the product, when I learnt another three months supply of visvical was on its way. What!? I didn't even finish the last three months supply I have on hand. (I made a mental note to self that I must track by subscription orders better, as I grieved over the excess supply of the product). Any way I digress. I went back on Viviscal (April? 2015) and I must say my hair looked shiny, feels thick and healthy and it was no longer shredding. I continued to sleep without satin hair piece or any special styling before bed. The good news I was not suffering from any breakage. I dropped coconut oil from my hair regime. If you can call what I do I regime. A few months later I got frustrated no results; I practically gave away an unopened box of Visviscal. In August of this year (2016) I started taking biotin (10000mg) and pregnacare tablets. (No I am not pregnant.) I am so far enjoying the results which came within a month of use. I will let you all know when I obtain my hair goal. Cheers Nikki Ps: Rich, I just completed a blog; I shared my experience with the world. Happy? I am net-socializing.. lol",,,02 Jul 2016

I'm not sure if I've noticed a difference but a good friend said my hair texture was less frizzy. My nails are super strong and long, however. I am confident that I'll see improvement in my hair with continued use. Update: The pills in first batch I ordered were wide and flat and made in Ireland (supposedly). I definitely have noticed a difference in my hair quality since I've been taking them. Just ordered my second box and the packaging looks like a knockoff, as well as the pills being smaller in diameter and thicker and made in the US (supposedly). I emailed Viviscal the lot numbers and expiration dates so hopefully they can confirm which batch is real. I will be returning these pills pending their response. There is a reason the price is significantly cheaper than the pills at the store. (First order is the box/pills on the right and the lot number on the bottom; second order is left/top. I think the second one is the fake.) Update #2: I checked the lot numbers and expiration dates with the company and they told me that both boxes were legit but they have two factories, which would account for the differences in the pills. However, the second box (made in the US) is giving me really bad, unrelenting acne. The first box from Ireland also caused breakouts but that subsided after a week or so whereas this time it won't stop. If I can consistently get the pills made in Ireland, I'll keep taking them cause they definitely do seem to be making some difference. If not, the acne is a dealbreaker.",,,28 Mar 2016

However, my hair is my glory and confidence, so I’m going to continue taking the supplements. So far the best experience with REAL hair growth. This product delivers everything it claims.",,,15 Apr 2018

11155,"viviscal extra strength hair nutrient tablets, 90-tablets",40.35,"Using this since 2016 and yes, it does work",5.0 ,"Ok, I held off writing this review until I could say that I have been using this product for a while. So, I have been using this product since March 2016 (that would be just about 2 years). I have a thyroid condition which I think is somewhat responsible for my hair thinning. I'm 52, so I'm also expecting to get some thinning just due to age, but I had started to see more hair loss that I liked. My thick ponytails were getting quite thin. I did some research and found this product. I have been taking it faithfully twice per day for the past two years. it took some time for me to see a difference but now I can honestly say that my hair feels much thicker than it has in years. Its still not quite as thick as when I was 20 years old, but there is absolutely no sign of thinning spots and it looks and feels very full when I touch it. I'm also noticing a lot of new hair growth, many little hairs growing all over my head. I noticed this more because almost at the same time I started taking this product I decided to grow out my bangs. Now that they are all gone I am noticing how many little hairs are wanting to replace my bags. Its actually very exciting to see all this growth. If you want immediate results then maybe this is not the product for you, but if you have a little time then go ahead and try it. I am happy that I did and I will continue to use it .",,,09 Apr 2018

Especially the ones who wrote about the product being fake. It’s not fake it’s quite real because I have used it for 6 or 7 years! I’ve been a licensed cosmetologist for many years and still practicing in Wash, DC. Here is what I can tell you from experience. I found the directions not to be quite as straight forward as they should be. You have to follow the directions as stated from the beginning. Then decrease to one a day. And then continue forever. I have introduced it to a good number of clients. There are 2 is hasn’t worked for. One client was determined and all of a sudden after 2 years a significant amount of hair popped out around the hairline. So it works you have to decide how much time your willing to invest. From what I’ve seen give it at least a year. I myself stopped after some months and then realized it was working and went back on it. My clients have done the same. And it continues to work as long as you take it. I actually just use it a couple days per week now and won’t stop. Even my co workers see the difference in my hair and refer their clients to it.

11243,"viviscal extra strength hair nutrient tablets, 90-tablets",40.35,Really helps if you have alopecia,5.0 ,"PRO: It works for alopecia areata I had alopecia on over 50% of my scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes. I've been through it all: steroid injections, creams, acupuncture, etc. - nothing really worked for me. My acupuncturist suggested taking Viviscal in conjunction with treatment from my dermatologist (I'm doing laser treatment with an excimer machine). After 1 month, I started growing some spots of hair. It's been over 6 months now and my eyebrows have grown back, my eyelashes are no longer falling out, and the hair on my scalp is starting to fill back in. I do believe it was a combination of the laser and the viviscal.

It seems to have stopped my hair loss completely and it happened within just a few weeks of taking these. Now hopefully I'll be able to start growing it all back.

It's too soon to tell if my hair is growing yet, but my nails could be used as a screw driver if I couldn't find a real one! Plus they're growing a fast as the grass in the lawn. After years of putting on nail extensions on finicky nails this is great! Hopefully the thinning hair will follow soon. I'll update in another month. I promised an update... WOW!!! After the 1st month (May) I could put my hair up in a French twist or pony tail, a little skimpy, but by now, the end of June it's decidedly better. Shine and thicker texture have also returned. Good bye Rogaine hello Viviscal, my new best friend. Oh yes, my nails are still growing like weeds ... no complaint there! And to think I was once thinking of getting a wig :-). Try it, you'll love it! No aside effects, only praise after taking for just beginning the 3rd month. 4 months now, (Sept 4) . Nails still growing like crazy, my French twist or pony tail is looking better. Think this is because the texture has changed. I read that you shouldn't take longer than 6 months so I'll finish up what I have in 2 weeks, and just take Biotin and prenatal vitamins which have been recommended.",,,06 Jun 2017

My hair grows at a pretty good rate as it is, so I can't say much about this supplement for growth, Some years back, my hair has lost major density after my Dr had me on alot of antibiotics for a condition that resulted in me having to have a hysterectomy.

I started using this product and was purchasing it from Rite Aid and then realized Amazon had it as well so it is a subscription for me. I was taking two a day for a little bit but found that one a day works well for maintenance and it has helped my hair A LOT! I dyed my hair and did that for a number of years and as I got older the hair just stopped growing and starting breaking way too easily and I found I could not grow my hair at all! I found this product and I had tried a number of them over the years with few lasting results. I was desperate for something and so stuck with this and I can say, though it does take at least 3 months or maybe more to really start seeing the results-----------the results were like night and day for me!

11459,"viviscal extra strength hair nutrient tablets, 90-tablets",40.35,my skin is in great shape for my age,5.0 ,"My hair had been thinning considerably over the past 2-3 years to the degree that I was feeling self-conscious. Being in my 50s I imagined it was because of age, however, my skin is in great shape for my age. Six weeks ago I decided to get proactive and heard about Viviscal from a hairdresser, bought it that day and have been taking it religiously, and voila, I have a significant amount of regrowth and am thrilled! Unlike other reviewers I have not gained weight, suffered headaches or had any side effects. Important to note that I also did extensive research and discovered a condition called ""traction alopecia"" which I suspect was contributing to my case of thinning hair. For the past several years I have been sporting a pair of metal-framed wraparound sunglasses that were doubling as a hair band to keep my locks away from my face. Shades on top of head is my signature look, even on rainy days or while inside the house, at my desk, etc. About the same time as starting on Viviscal I stopped pushing my shades up and down on my head, which alleviated all that tightness and pressure, rubbing and snatching strands of hair from the top of my head. In short, I think that the combination of Viviscal and removing the traction of the sunglasses are to be credited with my success story.",,,27 Apr 2017

I noticed some thinning hair on the top front and sides of my head right around my face after I decided to take a year off from the pill after 15 years of constant use. Bad idea. Horrible idea. But anyway, one of the many nasty things that happened was my hair fell out. I'm only 33 and my curly hair has always been thick, so I was a tiny bit devastated. I got back on the pill (not because of my hair) and tried some different (expensive) shampoos and vitamins with maybe a little difference but nothing to brag about. Came across these and read some amazing reviews and crossed my fingers and ordered some. I'm almost finished with my 2nd box of pills, I have taken them religiously twice and day and I can't sing it's praises loud enough. My nails are thicker and harder than they've ever been in my entire life, and the little fuzzy curly baby hairs around my face are impossible to dispute. I know it's going to take a while and I will probably never get back to how my hair used to be, but this product has been a real self esteem booster and I will continue to take it as long as it's available (hopefully forever).",,,24 Feb 2017

11551,"viviscal extra strength hair nutrient tablets, 90-tablets",40.35,This stuff really does work!!,5.0 ,"No one is a bigger skeptic than me when it comes to hair growth treatments. I've tried expensive shampoos and different scalp sprays. Nothing made a huge difference. It's a scary fact that one out of every two women will experience hair loss/thinning....and of course I am one of them. What lit a fire under me was when I made a video of me opening my Christmas gifts from a friend who lives in another country. (It's how we do Christmas, being so far apart.) I saw the video of myself, and I already knew I had thinning hair, but it REALLY showed up in that video, my scalp was shining through my dark hair. I went online and started searching out all the different treatments that weren't shampoos or sprays. I read reviews from many different websites before deciding to try Viviscal. The reviews were pretty much 95% positive. And now here is my review. I had really given up on anything really helping. I'd already bought a topper and hair extensions (that didn't match my natural color, and are still in the box because I was putting off bleaching then dying them), and even some wigs. I hated the wigs, they were hot and itchy, and they didn't look natural. So down to my last hope, I got a box of Viviscal (locally, the price was better at the time). I kid you not, I'm only 2 weeks in and I can see a huge difference. My scalp is still visible, but nothing like it was. (I will be adding pics later on, of my hair NOW, and pics of my hair in a month or two.) I had my doubts about this working. Nothing else had really made a huge difference. I am so glad I took a chance on this! This is life changing, and I'm only two weeks in. I had my husband look at my hair to get his opinion, and he was blown away by how much less scalp was showing. I went out today and for the first time in years, I wasn't embarrassed to be seen. It's very traumatic to lose your hair. I have nothing to gain, but I'm telling you, if you've tried everything (and even if you haven't), please give this a try. I had pretty much given up. Now I know there is hope. And in only two weeks!! I expected it to take months to see a difference, if I was going to see a difference at all. In short, I am blown away by the results. I've spent the last 10 years trying to make peace with my thinning hair, and that just never happened. Then I tried covering it up with colored dry shampoos (that get all over your pillow case). I tried a lot of things. And not one of them did what Viviscal has done for me. So far I've not seen any changes in my nails, but I've read where some people have said their nails got better. Mine haven't, but I am ok with that. I'll be signing up on here to get a box sent every month. Btw, my box says Made In The US, it's not the made in Ireland that so many people say is better. I can't imagine what 'better' would be! I'm getting my hair back, and I never thought that would happen. If you're on the fence, just give it a try. If I'd tried this first, I'd have saved myself hundreds of dollars on products that barely worked, if at all. ETA: Something I left out something that is worth mentioning. I can't see the hair on the top of my head well, so I had my husband look at it for me and tell me what he saw. My thinning starts at my hairline and goes to the crown of my head, so it's about a 4-5"" square on the top of my head that is thinning the worst. My husband described the new growth to me. He said it's thicker than the hair that's already there, ie, the hair I have that hasn't fallen out. My hair fall has been dramatically reduced. As far as how much longer my hair has gotten, I can't really say for sure. I honestly wasn't worried about length, I was more concerned with thickness. My hair is about 2"" above my waistline. I have a LOT of stands of hair that are about 3"" long, I'm guessing that has to be the new growth, as my hair is all one length, no layers. My hair normally grows fast anyway, and I do think I've had a growth spurt since I started using Viviscal. I normally do a big chop every summer of anywhere from 4"" to a foot. (It irritates me when I'm tucking my shirts in and I have to pull my hair out of the back of my jeans!) I think I am going to skip the chop this year and just keep my ends trimmed, just to see how far this will go since I've started using Viviscal. My hair loss is hormonal (I'm 51) and also stress has been pretty rough for me for many years. I have very little grey. My husband said the new hair coming in is darker. (I never color my hair. My natural color is between dark brown and black.) I have to admit that I don't take this as it's prescribed. I take 2 together when I get up in the morning. The only thing that I consider to be a side effect is that I have been dealing with breakouts that I normally don't have, but they're not bad. I had a breakout a few days ago and I'm already clearing up. ETA: I've added a before and an after picture taken a month apart. There is actually more scalp showing in the before picture on the crown of my head, my hair is just laid back over it. I wasn't able to get the same lighting for both pictures. I have a ton of new growth in the second picture, and my hair is so much thicker than it was a month before, so obviously I'm getting new growth all over, not just on the top, though the top is the worst. I had some errands to do today, and for the first time in about 15 years, someone complimented my hair! I'm really excited to get to the six month mark, I think I will have much thicker hair and much less scalp showing. I don't know if my results are typical, because this is just one month of taking Viviscal. I don't mean to sound like a spokesperson, because I'm not. I'd just thought these kinds of results weren't possible. I may be back in 6 months with another picture. Thanks!",,,31 Jan 2017

At 29 I had lost 50% of my hair in about 3 months. I've just completed month 1 of viviscal and my hair has stopped falling out as much and I have a lot of new growth (see picture). I am so happy with my results and have now signed up for the subscription with target so I can use my red card. Can't believe target actually beat Amazon on pricing. The only problem I have with this is an ethical one... these contain shark. I'm a vegetarian and I don't feel good about taking these given there is cruelty involved. I wish the amino mar ingredient was synthetic and not just ground up shark. These also have a very fishy/ fish food like flavor and smell which is unpleasant but not intolerable. Minus one star for everything described in this paragraph. These don't seem to bother my stomach however I do always take with food. For the first month I was taking both pills in the morning. On the second package I reread the instructions and have now switched to taking them as recommended, one in the morning and one at night. Still had results taking both pills at once but I generally prefer to follow instructions for use provided by the manufacturer.",,,26 Dec 2016
11580,"viviscal extra strength hair nutrient tablets, 90-tablets",40.35,"It Works - It Really, Really Works!!!",5.0 ,"I've been using Viviscal Extra Strength 2x a day since June 24, 2016 - a little over six months today - and felt it was time to post a review and share my results with the product. I use it because I have hypothyroidism which caused me to lose a lot of hair. My hair loss has been going on for awhile but started getting worse in the past two years. My endocrinologist had been monitoring my hormone levels (TSH, T4, T3, etc.) and tweaking my medication to keep my levels optimum, but the hair loss continued no matter what we did. Finally, my doctor suggested my hair loss may just be a natural result of aging and not thyroid related at all. Well, I wasn't about to just sit back and go bald without fighting - I'm only 51! And when I say ""go bald"", I'm not exaggerating. I had a receding hairline like a man and the top of my head was so thin that I was getting scalp sunburns (I live in Florida so this was a definite issue). Late one night I saw an infomercial for Viviscal. I don't generally pay attention to products sold that way (I figure if they're really that good, why don't they just sell them in stores?) but decided to give Viviscal a shot. I ordered it from Amazon because it was much cheaper. As I said, I began taking it on June 24th. For probably about 2 months I didn't really notice a difference growth-wise but did notice less hair falling out when I shampooed. After the 3rd month, my hairdresser mentioned that I had a lot of new growth on top and in the front over my forehead- very short hairs that I had seen but I thought they were breakage from styling (I was constantly playing with my hair, trying to come up with a style that would disguise the hair loss). Now I'm at 6 months out and I have to say Viviscal is definitely working for me. The hair loss on top/in front? Not even noticeable at all anymore. I'm absolutely amazed at how much it's grown in. It's probably about 4 inches long now and for the first time in years I'm able to pull my hair back into a ponytail. Some observations: My hair has always been wavy, but now it's very curly. I have no idea if/how Viviscal did this, but I don't care - I love it. Secondly, the texture of my hair has changed somewhat. It was coarse & dry but now it feels pretty normal other than the curliness. And thirdly, I am still experiencing hair loss when I shampoo my hair but it's honestly nothing like it used to be. I used to remove a huge hairball from the tub after every shower. Now I'd say I remove that much in a week. All in all, I am thrilled with Viviscal and will continue using it despite the cost, although at some point I may just start taking it once a day as maintenance. I highly recommend the product and would be happy to answer any questions about my use of it.",,,26 Dec 2016

Over the course of 6 years, my hair has fallen out three times due to stress called telogen effluvium. I finally got my hair back from the last one three years ago and was enjoying beautiful hair until I noticed it was falling out again! I was devasted, almost suicidal. This shouldn't happen three times to young 28 year old person! I could deal with it the first two times, but not for a third time. I don't have bald spots, just overall loss of density. I knew what triggered it every time, and each time was emotional stress due to a break up. Stupid, but it affected me. Anyways, I raced to a dermatologist and she suggested Viviscal. I have only been using it for 3 weeks now and I see a difference! My hair just feels thicker, it's shinier and I swear, filling in near my part and sides. The shedding has dramatically decreased too! I went from being sooooo depressed about this to feeling ok again. I don't look sick, as anyone who experiences hair loss knows your hair looks scraggly and frizzy while it's shedding. My hair just looks good! I have no side effects such as nausea or acne. I am praying this continues. Viviscal saved my sanity, truly. My only question and concern is does hair fall out again when you stop? Update: 12/23/16 I will come on here to update every few weeks if I can. I have now been taking Viviscal for 4 weeks. I think I spoke too soon. For some reason, the strengthening and thickening effects dont seem to be lasting. I only finished the first pack in the box and started the second. When I started the second, I noticed my hair felt weak again, so I opened the third pack in the same box and started that one. Its still the same. It seems as if the dosage is different?? The first pack worked amazing. I ordered directly from Viviscal, not from Amazon so I know I have the real deal. The shedding is still less and I do notice a little of improvement. I'll continue taking it with the hopes I will see amazing results. It has only been a month.",,,12 Dec 2016

It is a way of saying how you really feel, or being funny without having to try. I believe that's why it gets love it reviews. Any purchase online should be reviewed, not saying anything new. Multiple phrases just have to hope at least one fits your style. Didn't come with batteries when I ordered it, just a heads up, but doesn't impact rating.

11885,the official bs button,7.8,"OK. Sometimes works, sometimes not.",3.0 ,"First, it's not as pictured. The one I received has a black concave tapered base. The biggest problem that I have is that the internal piece that connects the battery to the unit that creates the sound disconnects very easily. It's not too difficult to fix, but why should you have too, right? After fixing it a few times, I just hung it on my cubical wall as a decoration.

I bought this thinking it would be similar but the volume is low, the speech quality is poor, it only has about 5 phrases which are not inspiring like ""warning, bulls**t detected"".

Definitely will not be purchasing or recommending this to anyone. The only thing I could do with it was use it in a white elephant gift at Christmas.",,,07 Jan 2013
11901,the official bs button,7.8,small but to the point,3.0 ,It was a simple button that brought great pleasure. It had 4 lines that it circulated from. None just simply called out BS. The voice of the button kind of reminded me of a rodeo announcer.,,,05 Jan 2013

11907,the official bs button,7.8,"Not as pictured or described...and beware, it makes sounds WHILE SHIPPING.",3.0 ,"I ordered this for a friend as a gag gift. There are several problems with this order. First of all, the button is NOTHING like the one shown in the pictures OR DESCRIBED in the text. They describe it as lighting up and buzzing. It does neither. The phrases they list? It says none of them. The look of the item? Not even close. But that's not the worst part. They shipped it with the batteries in and ACTIVATED. And it was shipped in a flimsy package (not really a box). This meant that just touching the box pushed the button. I had this delivered to my OFFICE. It was saying BULLSHIT phrases over and over again as they brought it to my desk. I'm lucky I wasn't fired as we can't use that kind of language here. This seller really needs to be more careful and accurately describe the item. Also, do SOMETHING in shipping the keeps the button from playing.",,,02 Aug 2012
11908,the official bs button,7.8,Received different product than ordered in picture,1.0 ,"I have a Bulls**t button, exactly as pictured when I bought the product. However, a different version of the button arrived today and I am very disappointed. It has some different phrases and a different voice than the one I currently have.

11909,the official bs button,7.8,Not what I expected,3.0 ,"I ordered this button thinking it was the same one as the one in the picture which is the one I've seen before.

11910,the official bs button,7.8,Battery problem,2.0 ,"I ordered two of these. One is OK and the other did not work.

I guess I can push the button on the one that works...",,,08 Feb 2012
11911,the official bs button,7.8,funny but battery issues,1.0 ,"Funny little toy. Great for conference calls. But, will not work when you try to put new batteries in, so it looks like it will only work as long as the original batteries hold up, at least in my case.

11914,the official bs button,7.8,Arrived with broken package and shorted circuit,2.0 ,"The packaging arrived with cracked plastic and the battery was dead. I replaced the battery and wrapped it up (it was to be a stocking stuffer for christmas), and by the time it was unwrapped 2 days later, the brand new batteries were dead. I understand it's a cheap product, but c'mon... it should at least work for a week before breaking down. (The one or two lines I heard immediately after replacing the batteries were funny and my dad would have really gotten a kick out of the toy, if it had worked...)",,,25 Dec 2011
11915,the official bs button,7.8,dead batteries,2.0 ,"I ordered 4 of these for Christmas gifts and when they arrived all the batteries were dead..buying the new batteries added expense to the gift..They are very cute and a great fun gift, but embarrassing to give a gift that does not work..",,,23 Dec 2011
11916,the official bs button,7.8,Battery came dead!!,1.0 ,"This was suppose to be a gag gift for a co-worker. Cheap, simple. Now I have to compromise the unopened box as a gift to buy and replace the batteries! Pathetic. Really. In fact, I'm so irritated about it I'm writing a review before I even hear if the gag sounds good.",,,16 Dec 2011
11917,the official bs button,7.8,Not the same item!!!,1.0 ,"The picture shows the button looking like the ""easy"" button from STAPLES. When i got the item it was a totally different item. It was black and looked nothing like the ""easy"" button as advertised. It was a totally different item :-(",,,05 Dec 2011
11918,the official bs button,7.8,Gets old fast,3.0 ,"This button has about 5 phrases. Each is different and said in a male voice. Voice sounds somewhat like a robotic, male voice shouting through a bull horn. It's somewhat funny. Does get old fiarly quick though. It's something you'd play with for 20 minutes and then give to a friend so they can have a good laugh and then passing it off to someone else as well. The price tag is reasonable for what you get. It's not an amazing purchase, but for the cost it's not a risky purchase.",,,26 Oct 2011
11919,the official bs button,7.8,"Somewhat interesting, nothing more",3.0 ,"I also have the Staples Easy button. The BS button, even though it costs more, does not have the same build quality or tactile click feedback as the lower price Easy button. The BS button feels a bit flimsy, and a bit loose. The quality tactile feel of the Staples button gives more button-pressing satisfaction than this one. The words 'BS' is cheaply printed on the button, while on the Staples button, 'easy' is actually raised. Tip: the Staples button costs less if you buy it from a Staples store. The BS button lights up and gives a few simple phrases such as, ""This is 'BS'"", or, ""Warning, warning, 'BS' alert"" with sirens going off. It was a hit at first. Works great when you're with friends who are Staples employees, but outside of that it doesn't get much use as its humor wears off fast.",,,24 Aug 2011
11920,the official bs button,7.8,Not like the Staples button,2.0 ,"I was kind of expecting the same kind of thing that you get with the Staples ""That was easy!"" button but the stuff that comes out of this thing when you push the button isn't just ""BS"", it's a bunch of goofy/corny expressions.",,,09 Feb 2011
11921,the official bs button,7.8,"Good gift, but not much else unless you like these kind of novelties.",3.0 ,"As gag gifts go, this is a pretty okay item. Not too much to be excited about (least for me), but not bad either. It's louder than what I thought it would, so that's a plus. However, I was slightly surprised when I received it. The packaging is different and it's a bit smaller than it looks in the picture. Other than that, it's the same item. Would make a good gift to someone whom you don't know what to get and likes gag gifts/bull****.",,,24 Dec 2010
11922,the official bs button,7.8,"Surprisingly small, not a STAPLES button",3.0 ,"Just a fair warning, if you think this thing is as big as a STAPLES button, you're mistaken. It's half the size. Fun, but half the size.",,,19 Nov 2010

My brother could replace Tom Sawyer in the books, and if I didn't know better, I would think the character was written after him. He apitafies the term ""breezy"". So, now I have a button to press when they annoy me during family get together, namely the holidays. So why four stars? It isn't loud enough. I'd say it's barely 60 decibels and that is your ear very close to it. 60 decibels is REGULAR speech volume, but my family is not regular. More like 90 decibels and more than that if they try to out talk each other which is a frequent occurrence, especially during the holidays. So, unless we have a moment of silence, it is hard to hear this thing. It would be perfect if it had another 25 decibels. I'd give it 3.5 stars, dropped down only because of volume.",,,24 Dec 2016
