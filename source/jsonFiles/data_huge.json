She had worn it so hard there were holes underneath the handles. I have moments where I love having a cheap chicken purse ( I believe I purchased it for about 20 back before this purse exploded on here-- surprised they bumped it to $40... IDK if its worth that price personally), as opposed to a designer bag worth hundred of thousands of dollars-- and this purse makes people smile! This is def a novelty purse, the zipper on the top is kinda small ( the opening in general). Makes it hard to grab aroung in the bag, might be easier to have 2-3pouches in there with all your things in them. That way you could just pull a pouch out, instead of fishing in your bag with one hand.The lining inside is a pale yellow, gets dirty real fast--black would be perfect. Out of all the bags I have, some designer some not, this bag gets me the most compliments, even Nordstrom sales people love it, go figure!",

The smell ( which smelled like new dolls used to smell to me when I got them as child ) was not bad at all, it has since faded. The opening is small, that is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, it's hard to get anything out of this purse. I took it out in public as soon as I got it ( even though my sister begged me not to take it ) and the compliments began right away. I have had so many compliments on this purse that I lost count long ago. Not very long into the day, my sister was holding my purse for me and even sat it on her side of the tabletop of the restaurant we lunched at. I am not really interested in carrying the same cookie cutter purse the rest of the world has and this purse has put smiles on so many faces ( yes, one or two of them have been mean ones ) that I really look forward to going places with it. This little purse is a conversation starter and just seems to make people happy seeing it. So, own the look and carry it proudly and just tell them where you got it when they try to buy it from you because I have had a lot of that too.",

I have two complaints, first the opening is too fricking small, which is incredibly frustrating, given that it's roomy and so much more should fit in it than does. Second, it would be more aesthetically pleasing if a small amount of material/foam/whatever were in the head so that my poor chicken doesn't look so smooshed. Lastly, a previous reviewer extolled the virtues of the spacious handles, easily accommodating over the shoulder wear, even in a bulky winter cloak. If you purchased as a fat person, expecting it to fit over your arm, alas, it may not. I am still ridiculously happy with my stupid handbag, regardless.",

My only dislike is the length/size of the zip opening on top of the bag - it is 6 inches (15cm). To put a regular size ladies wallet or an umbrella inside the bag, I had to slip the item in sideways (not length-wise). I think it will be hard to have to maneuver an item to it's shorter side inside the bag just to take it out of the bag. And of course if you have \"big\" hands, it will be a struggle to get your hand even inside the bag. Even with my hands (XS Gloves American-Size), it was not easy for me. And the straps are not long enough to carry the bag on my shoulder.",

The purse also had a really insane smell. But for women who don't like big purses with small wholes I do not recommend this for you. Even though it is really cool it looks like a pretty good chicken the only problem is that it has a lot of space you can\u2019t put your things in there. I think it just needs to shrink in size and open the zipper more and it will be fine and pleas get rid of the smell.",

Then for fun I searched on Amazon to see if this purse was offered and there it was! We live a quite a distance apart, occasionally, I like to send her some strange gift in the mail just to let her know I'm thinking of her. This item fit the bill and it was on sale for a good price. So I placed the order and waited. She received and messaged me \"Are you kidding me?!\" She then posted a photo of herself with the purse on Facebook, her friends, and even her mother, marveled and raved about the purse. Everyone was jealous! I purchased the purse as a joke, but I received an update today that the purse made a debut outing with my friend, I was so surprised, never thought she would use it. I'm sure she didn't think so either, but the novelty must have grew on her. She said 4 people commented on the purse and were very excited! The purse was well worth the money for the laughs that we got, but was even more worth it now that my friend is going to use it! I haven't seen the purse in person so I can't speak of the quality, dimensions, etc. but gift-wise, this is great!",

The inside is just an empty large cavern with one pocket that is open (decent for keys and chapstick). I agree with everyone else that the smell is a little strong the first moments you have it, but mine has so far died down a bit. The zipper is also a little on the short side, so if your items inside are jumbled it can be a little harder to find. When I received mine it was a tad flattened, but the purse will naturally puff out after being filled (I'd say a day before the face on mine wasn't flat). Straps are short of course, easiest to carry it on the crook of your arm or in your hand rather than on your shoulder. My straps have this tubing in it that sometimes pops out a little bit, I just push it back in. All in all, amazing purse. I have gotten so many compliments on it. I ended up changing my text noise to that of a chicken cluck just to pull the whole thing together!",

I'm an animal lover and this bag is the right amount of cute and kitsch. The Red really pops and the bag compliments every outfit from a dress, nice pants, to jeans. You will love bringing this purse with you everywhere as your buddy, and enjoying all the fun comments people will make! The bag itself holds a lot of items, it has a smaller inside pocket for your keys or chapstick, and the lighter fabric lining helps you find items much easier (which is helpful since the zipper really is pretty short, enough for you to stick your hand in and feel around.)",

My neighborhood in particular, is awesome but is not the coolest (it's being invaded by investment bankers who are not cool at all). :-) I thought for sure that at least 4 or 5 women would stop me on the street asking me where I got the bag. I walked 3 blocks with my lovely rubber chicken purse without a word or glance by anyone (granted, I was holding it close to my body and my coat was the same off-white/yellowish color)...until, that is, a woman whom I suspect spied the lovely chicken, laughed out loud. Now, I couldn't tell if it was a, \"OMG, that's the BEST thing ever!\" laugh or a, \"OMG, what an incredibly ridiculous thing!\" laugh. Thinking she was a non-cool banker, I ignored that reaction and continued my walk. I got coffee (no reaction) and then went to my favorite bead/jewelry store (no reaction). Finally, I was so disappointed that my favorite jewelry store employees (and co-jewelry designers!) hadn't said a word, that I blurted, \"What do you think about my lovely rubber chicken purse?\" The reaction? \"I LOVE your chicken purse. Oh my God! That is the best!\" Not only did the employees genuinely gush about how much they LOVED my purse, but so did the customers. (Apparently, the head employee had designed animal purses at fashion school...which were shot down.) They even asked, \"Where did you get it??\" I'm looking forward to \"round 2\" next weekend. P.S.

The purse is definitely a conversation starter and everyone wants to feel it to see if it's actually made out of rubber. The only negative thing I have to say about this purse is the zipper. The zipper is fine but it is a tad bit small for the portion of the purse. You can definitely fit a lot of things inside: a wallet, phone, keys, tampons, and other items. I highly recommend this purse for the country girl at heart!",

I also get comments...lots and lots of comments. Many, many women have asked me where I got it in the two months I've been carrying it. Some ask me to wait while they run and get a friend to look at it. I've had a lady just tentatively reach out a finger and poke it at church, without saying a word. LOL. In fact, I've also had a number of men comment on the awesomeness that is the chicken purse. Okay...Pro's: Roomy. Very roomy! You can fit a lot of stuff in this bag. It seems to be very well constructed. The materials are, obviously, easy to clean and if you squish it, it bounces right back. Finally - IT'S A FREAKING RUBBER CHICKEN PURSE! Con's: Yes, amazing chicken purse or not, there are a couple of cons. The single biggest one is the opening zipper is kind of small and because of that it's hard to find things in. You do a lot of feeling around for what you want. I wish the little pocket on the side had a zipper. It's kind of worthless without it. The handles aren't sewn shut so the rubber hose thing that makes them round tends to try to slide out; you see it right away and slide it back, but still. But in the end, I love her. Yes, she's a her. She's a chicken, not a rooster. All I need now is an egg-shaped wallet.",

Lots of space for wallet, checkbook, camera, calendar, keys. It's fantastic. I love the whimsy of it all. If you have a whimsical bone in your body (or an ironic one) I suggest that you get this purse. (They also come in brown but online it looks less striking as a chicken. The details are not as clear.)

The zipper opening on top is small, as others have said, but not so small that you can't put belongings in. The purse cavern is large and can hold quite a bit, I imagine.

My chicken purse who I have named Ms. Nugget goes everywhere with me and I find it difficult now to go back to a regular purse. I was surprised that the purse is actually a little bit bigger then I expected. As stated before by other people the zipper is a little too small and sometimes you have to work to get things in or out. But that is the only complaint I could find with this purse. It is made of rubber but I did not notice any kind of rubber smell. Because it is made of rubber I would not put anything sharp in it. I like the fact that it is made from rubber because I have been caught in many rainstorms this spring and the rain drops just bounce right off it. The inside is made from a silky type material and it has one pocket which is handy. The red handles are comfortable and are made from some kind of sturdy wire. The purse over all is deep and can fit many things. It is also easy to wipe clean. I have to say I am very addicted to this purse and carry it where ever I go.",

                "review_text": "I love my chickens...and I really do like the concept of this purse. It is made of rubber, and therefore would be a great purse for rainy weather. When the purse arrived, it had been folded for shipping (I can understand that), However, I have to keep it fairly loaded so it doesn't look like a folded chicken. I love carrying it and always get compliments (or at least giggles), but I have had to quit carrying it since the zipper is so short and it is a constant struggle to get my wallet in and out through the zippered opening. When I do manage to get the wallet through the top it always seems to hang on the pocket inside the purse and I have to struggle to get it past that obstacle too. I am really disappointed that the inconvenience is greater than the pleasure of carrying it since I really do like the bag. I think it would have held up well if I had been able to use it more often. But alas, I guess it was not meant to be! On the plus side, once you are able to fit your items into the bag it holds quite a bit of necessary things that women like to carry around with them. Another plus for this bag is that if you happen to be of child bearing age and also happen to have a small person you are carrying around with you...I'm sure a couple of bottles would fit in here nicely along with a diaper or two. And if a bottle happened to leak...hey, no problem. Rubber chicken will protect liquids from bleeding through and damaging anything the purse happens to be sitting on. You would have to be careful with the diaper suggestion though. I think the zipper would probably tear the plastic around the diaper.",

The zipper was really small and I could not easily put anything inside it without intricate, time-consuming maneuvering. It was a conversation starter and the kids loved it. I took it to a farm school and the real chicken there had issues with it and tried to attack it. When I first unpacked it, I was thrown off by the smell, and I hoped that in time, it would diminish. No. It didn't. It's like a dead body was dipped in petroleum and glued to a giant moth ball. The fumes are so intense it makes your nose burn and your contact lenses bend inside out. You will weep for any kind of relief. I filled the entire purse with bounce sheets and wrapped it in wax paper and stuck it in the freezer for a week to see if the smell would fade away. No such luck. All my frozen food smells like it's been shoved up the tail pipe of a big rig. I had to throw everything out. I put baby powder in it and wrapped it in bubble wrap and put it outside for a week and then poured baking soda in the purse to see if that would help. No. It didn't. Although I really loved the concept and whimsy of the purse, I finally gave up the dream and donated it to Goodwill by dumping it in an overnight depository. At this time I must apologize to the needy who will discover this petroleum treasure. I mean you no harm. But it's cute, isn't it?",

I can see them selling this same purse for at most $20 and that's giving it a huge mark up for its novelty value. It probably only cost them like two bucks to make it. The material is thin and due to the way it's been packaged for who knows how long, the purse is lumpy. The area around the tail is folded out at an unflattering angle and one side of the face is lower than the other, along with many other lumps and bumps. The purse deflates easily and probably would only look nice if it was kept quite full. However, since the material is so thin my mother is worried that filling it too much will make it break. The plastic rod in the handles also seem like they may come loose and fall out if you're not careful. I can't believe I paid so much for this! At least my mother was amused by the idea of the purse rather than its execution. Thankfully the coin purse I got her made her really happy as it is something she can use for a long time.",

I had already read other reviews, so I was aware that the zipper compartment was small, so that didn't surprise me. It will take some getting used to, though, so if you're planning on getting this purse, be prepared for a small adjustment period as you get used to carefully guiding things through a small opening. That said, I have a very large wallet, and it fits inside. Think of it as a bonus - nobody is ever just going to reach into your purse and snatch something out. You'll *know* if they try, and they won't be able to do it quickly. Your chicken will protect your goodies. The purse can hold quite a bit. It's a fat little thing with one little side pocket inside. When I used it the other day I put this in it: - a full size wallet - some paperwork - a nail care case - an electronic cigarette case about the size of my full size wallet - lots of pens and pencils - a knife - a sewing kit - a comb and brush - some safety pins - some scissors - a 16 oz. bottle of soda - my cell phone - two small packages of candy - my keys - my medicine - a charging cord for the e-cig - women's personal products - a small credit card pouch - reading glasses in a plastic case - a roll of tape And although the little chicken was full, there was room for more. It's also water-proof, which can be quite handy where I live. The only way you could improve this thing would be to make it cluck when you squeeze the beak.",

I bought an egg key chain to go in the coin purse for my friend and it wouldn't fit in the opening and it is hard to get coins out of it unless you dump it over. I made a box that looked like a chicken nest and put Easter eggs in and around it and gave it to my wonderful boss for Easter. I don't know if she liked it or not.

The flat bottom is nice and the light colored interior helps to locate items inside. The only change I'd made is for the opening to be a few inches wider, but that's because I like big slouchy bags and the big openings that come with them. But the purse wasn't for me anyhow. I have been advised that Mom gets chatted up quite a bit whenever she takes her chicken purse with her. LOVE IT!!!",

In fact, when my daughter opened the box and we were passing \"Mrs. Henny Penny\" around, she mentioned that it smelled like Burger King. I crammed newspaper (supposed to absorb odors) and a scented dryer sheet. Let it sit for a few days and it seems to be tolerable. I don't carry it next to my nose so I no longer care about the smell...although I question if other can smell it as a I walk by because, Lordy, I hope they don't think that is me stinking like that LOL! :-D The perfect gift for a lover of all things chicken :-D",

I am actually a poultry owner, but I think this is such a fun purse even for the non-chicken owner! This purse is really well made. The rubber is thick, and it has a liner with a pocket inside. This is a much bigger purse than I was expecting. I'm not sure what I was expecting, actually, but you can really fit a LOT in this purse. I have gotten giggles and lots of great compliments on this purse. Everyone asks me where I got it and asks to touch it to see if it is REALLY rubber. (yes, it is) A very fun conversation piece, I have worn it everywhere from church, a girls night out, to just every day shopping. I'm surprised how many people love it, because I just got it for myself! The handles are a nylon webbing with a plastic form in them to hold their shape. They are really comfortable and I have no issues with the handles. I've had this purse about a month now and it's held up really well, especially since I've been using it every day since I got it. The great thing is, if it gets dirty, it would be easy to wipe down. ;)",

People love the hen bag all around the world. I took it to London, France, and Spain...everywhere I went, people were thrilled. It really is a conversation starter and broke down cultural barriers like no amount of well-meaning language butchering could. Anywhere I go, whether it's starbucks or a dive bar, people love the chicken. I decided that since everyone was going to be so nice about it, I would get little gifts to hand out to people who found it amusing, which is why I got the Mini Chickens: [...] They sell them by the gross, and I did not foresee getting through a gross of itty bitty chickens, but people love them. Kids, adults, men, women... everyone loves them. I receive photos from all measure of situations and geographies featuring my chickens having margaritas, sunning themselves, supporting mini gnomes, etc. I think of this bag as a lifestyle. There is one seriously bad thing about this bag, which is the zipper at the top. It's so fricken small. It takes a lot of work to get anything at all out of the top. Digging for makeup is practically impossible. It's just an unfortunate function of the physiology of the rubber chicken style, but it still is a pain in the butt. However, at $22, you can not get a better life improvement tool. I truly believe that. Combine it with a taco coin purse, since I hear the matching rubber chicken coin purse sucks.",

It's not bad because it's still a correct pair but kind of dissapointing because I want them to have the same color. The plastic packaging is sealed so I'm guessing these hands are packaged in bulk through a conveyor or something and the pieces are not well sorted as they go through and fall into the plastic.

The first package contained 10 x right hands (9 x Caucasian; 1 x POC). The second package contained 6 x left hands and 4 x right hands (of which 3 x Caucasian; 1 x POC). In total I have six full sets of tiny hands (containing a left AND a right), and eight standalone right hands. Loved the inclusion of POC hands (although they don't make a matching pair, just two right hands). The hands themselves are hilarious! They seem like good quality durable material, and have nice detail making them look more realistic. The holes are a good size for adults, but might be a bit big for younger kids. All in all, not disappointed and looking forward to the joy these tiny hands are bound to bring!",

I don't know if the description was changed from when I ordered, but the current description says only right hands. It would be nice to have an equal number of left and right hands. I like having the thumbs match my thumbs. We take these everywhere and either get excitement and smiles out of people or get awkward and creeped out looks. I love the details with the veins and fingerprints though. They are a little tight on my fingers, but I think most people won't have this issue.",

Or go vintage, I own an old ONKYO turntable from the 80\u2019s and it sounds great. Crosley Cruisers don\u2019t come with a pre amp, like the LP120 so you can\u2019t plug in passive speakers.

                "review_text": "Literally buy anything else, every one of these has a fatal design flaw that makes playing modern records impossibe: the speakers are built into the device...the device that relies on picking up very specific vibrations to play the music...think about that. As the speakers vibrate, the needle vibrates and skips. This isn't so bad on old, thinner records from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, but newer, thicker records with better bass response will skip all over the place. So don't ever buy an all-in-one turntable, because they will all skip when playing new records. If you don't want to spend the money on a proper turntable, proper speakers, and a proper amp/receiver, then seriously reconsider whether vinyl is actually right for you, or if you are just following a trend. If you value convenience over the experience of listening to an entire album all the way through, then feel free to take advantage of the last 30 years of advancements in technology. Another FACT that you need to know is that NO, vinyl does not sound better than CDs. It doesn't sound \"warmer\" or more \"true\". Assuming perfect media conditions, then the sound quality is INDISCERNABLE by human ears. Any perception that vinyl sounds better or even different at all is entirely placebo. In double blinded studies no one has ever been able to tell the difference between CD, vinyl, and even cassette tape. So why do people think that vinyl sounds better? Why do they like vinyl if it doesn't sound any different? Well because many young people alive today have only ever experienced iTunes, mp3s and other compressed audio formats. All physical media will sound better than an mp3, becuase it hasn't been compressed (had certain frequencies and sounds removed to save disk space). As to why people would prefer vinyl even though it sounds the same, I think people are tired of not owning their music. You can buy songs piecemeal from iTunes, but you never own them. They still belong to Apple and you're just licensing it from them. They can take it away from you at any time. But if you buy an album on physical media, then it's yours. And if you're going to buy something physical, you might as well get the big one with the nice album art. If you want a nice automatic TT on a budget, go with an Audio Technica LP-60. You can even get one with USB out so you can run it through your computer if you're too cheap to buy speakers and an amp. Oh and stay away from bluetooth speakers because they compress the audio and you might as well be listening to mp3s at that point. Good luck, kids!",

However, when it comes to these portable turntables, excitement couldn't be further from our minds. They are sleek and light but beyond style they fail miserably at their primary function: playing records. The main issue with these turntables is their lack of a counter-weight at the base of the tone arm. This weight is a vital component of any record player, as it set the correct force (grip if you will) on the record with the stylus. Without this weight you will have a stylus that skates across several of your records (180g records in particular). If you plan on playing Dynoflex records exclusively then you may be able to avoid any issues. Our recommendation: buy a record player with a counter-weight.",

                "review_text": "I got this as a gift and the design of the unit is very sleek. I've only had it for a day but have discovered a few things that might upset people in hindsight. --Summary-- It looks cool and sounds ok for the price you're paying. Unfortunately you need a pretty open space so the case can open up completely to prevent the record from rubbing against it. If you want higher quality when playing your records, I suggest investing in a higher end, professional turntable from Audio Technica, Numark, Pioneer, etc and plan on spending at minimum $100 (Note: these kind of turntables don't come with built in speakers). This is a fun little novelty item that's pleasing to the eye. --More Details/Helpful Tips-- 1. The case has to be fully open when playing records: I saw reviews saying that the records sounded warped or like the turntable's speed was off. I ran into the same problem at first. I tried have the case set up on a shelf with the top of the case sitting against the back of the shelf upright. I found out this was because the turntable was rubbing up against the case a bit. Once I put the turntable on the counter and leaned the top of the case as far back as it could go, the record played at its intended speed smoothly. 2. Your records have to be cleaned regularly to be played without skipping: I have a dog who sheds a ton. If there's a lot of dust/hair/particle build up on your record, the needle will skip. Google how to correctly clean your records. Once I cleaned mine off, the needle skipped a lot less often. If you're still unsatisfied after cleaning, you may need to upgrade to a better needle. 3. Speakers aren't the best: You're spending $70 on an all in one system so there you go. It won't be the greatest quality sound. The speakers don't have great bass. If they did, every hit of the kick drum would cause the needle to skip. Imagine putting a regular turntable on a sub-woofer. Just wouldn't work. If I want better sound when using it, I line out (on the back of the unit) to another sound system and get more of the frequency spectrum off my records this way.",

BUT THEN everything started to go bad... Every single record I play on it sounds extremely warped and just down right awful. At first, I assumed it was my records, so I tested them on my step father's turntable. They sounded perfect. I tried the Crosby again the next day and it still sounded awful. I would splurge $20 more (on a different brand) if you want a good one. My stepdad's sounds amazing. DO NOT GET THIS RECORD PLAYER. IT SUCKS.",

I recommend using external speakers if possible since the on-board speakers are small, and you are listening to vinyl. The reason I am giving 4 stars is that this unit is very light and the switches could have a stronger more friendly design. The briefcase top also comes very close to the bottom of the playing album. While it did not rub on the albums I have played, an older warped album may strike the lid when spinning so use caution if you are playing a lot of vintage records.",

These are cheaply made and are absolutely horrendous in quality of sound. What people might not realize is that Vinyl isn't a cheap hobby, so people who think they're gonna get a good turntable for $70 are terribly mistaken. If you are a beginner I recommend the Audio Technica AT-LP 60. It's about $100 and WAY better than these pieces of Junk. For people who want a good turntable you're gonna have to spend at least $200-400. If that's too much for you then maybe you should find a different hobby. STAY AWAY FROM CROSLEY, they are complete junk. The world of vinyl is a fantastic place and you should invest your money wisely, but please, just don't buy one of these, they are horrible.

It's also very small so it's easy to store and carry. The turquoise color is adorable and has a very retro feel to it. I didn't have any problems with the needle not having enough weight on it to play. You do have to be careful when moving around the turntable when it's playing a record. If you jump or make a lot of movement it can make the needle jump a little, but that's the only \"problem\" I have found with the needle. I do wish it came with a USB port to plug in my own music, but I can't complain too much since that would defeat the purpose of the turntable itself. I think the sound is great and I had no problems with the quality of the sound. Overall, I think it's a decent record player for the price if you are looking for an introduction to records.",

This unit is definitely not suited for that. If you're like me though and have a collection of old records up in the attic or want to pick up some on the cheap and have a listen now and again without spending a fortune then this honestly isn't a bad choice, and it looks cool too. If you're planning on trying to get high fidelity or want to play expensive and/or rare mint condition records then this is sure to disappoint. In short, it is what it is.

I'm not crazy about the quality of the built in audio. Sometimes it comes out grainy or static-like. However, I do like that this little guy comes with a 45 adjuster! I also think its cool that you can get an aluminum 45 adjuster in the color of your turntable for $15 more. (I actually saw these at BooksAMillion.) **I did some research after I received my Crosley portable turntable and found out that Crosleys are notorious for their low quality needles. This subtly but eventually wears down your vinyl. Due to this I only play my mainstream vinyl that I can easily replace for $25 tops. I do not play my older vinyls that I've collected over years from peddlers malls for great prices because I know it'll be far more for me to replace them for the great deals I got. Eventually I want to save up and get a nicer setup and have great audio because I love music and I love the original smooth vinyl sound. ***BUT I have to say if you're only going to be \"collecting\" new vinyl and playing it just for the nogalistic feel then I don't think there would be anything wrong with this turntable for you.",

But it is definitely not perfect. The speakers are weak and will blow out easily. I definitely recommend using external speakers with this player. The arm is also very light. Even some of my 180gram vinyls have a hard time playing on it. Luckily I have more serious record players, but if this is your only one be aware that some of the newer vinyls will still have trouble. I do love the record player it's self though. I love the design and color. I find it very girly for a girly girl like me. I also like to take it on road trips, and the briefcase style makes it much easier to carry around. I also think that it's design is just enough to brighten up a room and would be very good for kids. Also another thing to know is that there is no preamp in the turntable. It's apart of the Crosley design to keep the turntable light and at low cost. So when using the headphone jack you will need an amplifier or power headphones to get quality sound. Something to keep in mind if interested in buying this record player. So overall I do like this record player and recommend it to the not so serious and beginner collectors. Just remember the light arm and speaker quality is only so-so. But a good pair of computer speakers can fix that right up.",

I was the same way, but I went out on a limb and just bought this turntable anyway. At first I had no problems, records played fine and the only problem was the atrocious quality of the built in speakers. I honestly don't understand the inclusion of these, because they are just not good, so I immediately plugged in some better speakers. After purchasing more records over the months, I noticed that a lot of them would skip, sometimes ridiculously. I thought it was the records at first, but after reading more about it, I learned it was the turntable itself. Simply put, since vinyl has become increasingly popular again over the years, brands like Crosley are trying to cash in and provide a cheap and affordable turntable to consumers. Well it may suck to hear this, but getting into vinyl is not cheap. It will cost you a lot for a great quality turntable, as well as other accessories such as preamps or receivers and speakers, and even the vinyl itself. Now I know you probably don't want to spend hundreds of dollars for an amazing turntable, especially if you're just getting into vinyl, and you'd like to keep it as cheap as possible. The best thing you can do is avoid this turntable, and instead get an Audio Technica AT-LP60 turntable. I've had this turntable for quite sometime now, and have had a much better experience. No records have skipped ever, and the quality is a big improvement over this. It's only a bit more, but trust me when I say it's definitely worth your money if you want to get into vinyl. That turntable with a good pair of speakers will be a great beginners setup.",

Have tried it with very old records from my university's library and they sound new. Maybe I should have paid another $30 or so for a better player, but the size and usability of the Crosley are hard to beat. Plus, its retro design is great.",

Steer clear of this if you're an audiophile like me but new to the vinyl \"scene\" or \"trend\" or \"movement\" or \"PAC\" of whatever the heck all the trendy ultrahipster kids call it these days (I wouldn't know, because I was a hipster before it was cool). Mkay, so the only thing this has going for it is that it looks good. Well great, so like nightshade it looks promising but will end up just killing you (maybe that's exaggeration but, hey, hipsters need melodrama too, amirite?). My Cruiser came defective right out of the box! It produced a horrible squeaking while playing. After disassembly I discovered the the spindle had not been fully lubricated. After reassembly I was good to go. Now let's listen to that sweet sweet vinyl sound! Wow, wow this sounds like crap, and yes I have it hooked up to my awesome sound system so yeah the problem lies in the player. And, is the record playing just a tad too slow? Really? I compare against a digital file... and wow, it's too slow by maybe 2% or so? Just enough to really irritate the phonically obsessed. So I say, hey...I'm a noob to the vinyl thing maybe I can improve it. So I tap into the worldwide knowledge base via my computational device. I discover that you can get better needles (er stylus) to improve the sound etc etc. I also come to find out that this cruiser is so heavy with the needle it'll probably ruin my vintage Star Wars Soundtrack (from episode IV, because the prequels are dead to me). Before I can even get the diamond stylus on there the player starts to echo like it's trying to win the World Cup of Marco Polo or something.I put the diamond stylus on there for fun, because hey I got nothing to lose at this point. And wouldn't you know it, it DID sound better, now the echo is clear and less grainy! So between the echo and under driven belt speed I gave up, I gave up so hard. Now I'm rockin an Audio Technica AT-LP60. For $20 more you'll enjoy the epic performance. If you're going to drop $75 on a total piece of garbage, you should really consider just spending the $95 for the AT-LP60. If you are an audiophile but new to the vinyl \"whatever\" then do yourself a big big favor and DON'T buy this piece of junk; try the AT-LP60, you won't be disappointed.",

Thankfully, Amazon is standing by their product and allowing me to return it, past our return window, due to this defect. After the issue came up we found out it's a known widespread issue. Obviously, you can't win them all at this price point - but if my 13-year-old notices it, then it's gotta go.

I also like that there is a headphone jack and outputs for hooking up external speakers. The latch keeps the case securely closed, there are rubber grips on the bottom to keep it from sliding off of slippery surfaces, and it comes with an attachment so it can play 45s. My only complaint is that there is a small spot on the outer casing that got nicked during production or packaging (see 3rd photo). It was there when I took it out of the box. But it's so small, it's not really worth going through the hassle of exchanging it for a new one. Overall, I love this record player and definitely recommend it if you're looking for something small and affordable!",

It looks cute, thats about it. Even our cat is put off by the horrible sound quality of this. Unfortunately it is too late for me to return this piece of junk. I wish I never bought it and read all the negative reviews on this player. Buyer beware! FURTHERMORE, if you want to return this for the 1 year manufacture warranty, you have to pay to ship it and pay to have it shipped back. So basically pay another $40 to get a new record player that probably won't work. Good Job Crosley!",

There is a headphone jack so you can plug in external speakers (something I will certainly be doing), but the quality of the tiny-built in speakers are very muted, kind of \"underwater\" sounding. With that said, the best part of this product is the aesthetic. It's cute, it's small, it's portable- my only complaint on the look is that the colour is not turquoise. It's baby blue. TL;DR- if you are just looking for something cute to listen to vinyls only every so often, and you have other speakers you can use with it- this works for the money spent. If you're looking for high-quality sound and equipment, definitely look elsewhere.",

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Spend your money on a better quality one that will work well and last a long time. I do not trust Crosley at all. Save up for something better.

I was shocked after she opened it and got it out, put Sam Smith's In the Lonely Hour LP on it, the sound was really good for those two little speakers. I love the vinyl is coming back. She loved it and it was pretty easy to use. Cons The only one I found was that I noticed on other competitors that they offered more options, this one is very simple, lift needle, put it over, lower needle and that's pretty much it. Well and volume button. Pros Sound is really surprisingly amazing Easy to use",

                "review_text": "I received this Crosplay turntable as an early Christmas present. It had been a while since l'd owned a turntable. I own a little over a hundred LPs and now finally had a player to enjoy them again. I was all giddy and smiles as l picked my favourites to play. On the first song from the first album l played, l noticed some... Issues. But first, let's start with the positives. On the plus side, this is a relatively small and compact turntable. It's as portable as it gets and it looks great. It's charming, classy and convenient. The choice of colours it is available in is astounding. It offers all the functions of a traditional record player at an affordable price and reads 33s, 45s and 78s. Being able to link an lpod or MP3 player is a great addition. You'll get a lot of \"Aw!\" from people when they first glance at it. It plugs and plays straight out of the box, no installation or effort required on your part. It's a cute record player and it would look great as a decorative accessory. That's all the positive l'm afraid. You buy a record player, it's primarily function should be to play records, the rest comes second. There are a few setbacks. As cute and affordable as the player is it simply doesn't play records as well it should. The vinyls tend to skip, it's usually not by a huge amount of time but it's certainly noticeable and disconcerting. I tested it -with both old records and fresh out of the wrapper ones- and l can safely say it's not due to the condition of the records themselves. I wondered if it was the needle but nothing seems wrong on that end. I read of other reviewers' experiences where the needle would drag along the record but it didn't do that to me, yet. The real problem lies in the flawed design of the Crosplay table. The briefcase design, as efficient and portable as it may be, is not fitted to play the larger records. The records tend to hit against the inside of the briefcase and cause skips. You can try and stretch the case as far as you may, nada, niet. It will still be ineffective. They still skip if this doesn't happen due to occasional wobbling and other reasons. I read about some people making it work with a quarter but sadly the old quarter on the arm trick didn't work for me. Not every record skips, but in my experience with this player usually about half the albums played will whether in small or significant way. What's strange is that there's a higher frequency of skipping on new records than old ones. I decided to read some reviews on the Crosley Cruiser and saw that l wasn't the only one experiencing problems. The amount of people who returned/received a deffective product is astounding. Maybe it was too good an offer to believe but playback issues ruin an otherwise great product. It's a beauty. It sounds decent enough even without speakers, but it skips far too much for my taste. Definitely style over substance in this case. As it stands, l still play this records on this turntable but it seems inevitable that l'll have to replace it and invest in something better. I suggest you do the same. In retrospect, if you're looking to play that one record you may never listen to again or use it as a decoration, it could work. If you're looking for a legit, affordable record player to play your collection this isn't it. I was also disappointed reading some of the comments regarding this product and thought \"Well maybe it'll work for me...\", it didn't. Save your money and invest in a more expensive player because here you get exactly what you pay for. 2 stars.",

But to my wife and I's surprise, it played flawlessly. Neither of us has ever owned one and we were able to set up and play a record within seconds. It's very user friendly and easy to learn and to add to the list of surprises, it plays very well. I bought this as a christmas present for my wife, but upon seeing it we opened it to make sure it was what we were looking for. It was. My wife's face went from tired, worn and sad to happy and full of life when she first heard it play. She loves the color and the ability to just unplug it and take it with her. The speakers are loud and clear enough for the price/size. Take into account this record player is \"portable\" so the sound quality isn't meant to be the greatest, but I was delighted. It's louder and clearer than our laptop speakers and filled our downstairs living room with music. Perfect for what we needed. Thank you so much.",

I saw one being demoed at the mall a few days earlier and long story short, you can tell the table wasn't spinning at the proper speed. Also, I'd like to add that the build is extremely fragile and you could very easily break the thing if you're not careful. The demo guy accidentally did... Anyway, like everyone else here is saying, do not cheap out on a turntable. You get what you pay. It is much better to save up for a very good set up than to go through multiple lower quality ones before finally settling on a decent one. Also, the more you invest on higher quality products, the longer your vinyls will last. I will say though, the only good thing about this product is how adorable it looks.",

The overall volume is not pretty loud, but it does have audio ports on the back if you wanted to plug it into a speaker or sound system, but if you don't have one available you can really only use it if you're next to it in a quiet environment. One issue I had with it was the lid, in order to play the large vinyls you have to open the lid pretty wide, since there are no rubber mounts on the back to secure the lid in this position the lid must rest on the power cord. This bends the cord and could break it over time. Luckily I quickly solved this problem by going to Home Depot and finding some rubber things in the plumbing section, which I could glue on to the rear of the player. The player does have a headphone jack which I think is great, but just the needle running over the vinyl creates a little noise, so don't think using headphones eliminates all sound. I highly recommend this player if you're willing to make a quick trip to home depot, but considering the quality and price of the item, I think it was worth it.",

A Theory might be that the needle can't handle dust on the record very well or it's an electrical problem, but I'm pretty sure it's the needle. Also the leather where the corners meet is slowly coming apart. I've been really gentle with it too, but I just fixed that with some Gorilla Glue. But all in all, once I get the skipping problem fixed it's not a bad Turn table to own.",

I got this for my wife so she could play many of those old records. It was fun seeing my wife's face light up as this is a very cute looking piece. Lets face it you're not going to rock out with this thing with its stock speakers. In a quiet room this plays Sintra with a very wonderful vintage feel. This has RCA outputs, so you can connect it to a larger system. This has 3 speed. The adapter for 45s has a convenient spot for itself for storage. I hate when people use a small system and say it has a tiny or \"tin - e\" sound. Those people need to look elsewhere. It's small don't expect much. I understand that vinyl has it's place in HIFI. But this is a wonderful LOFI setup. Cute looks, cute sound, and convenient. This is great little piece and in the right setting has emits a wonderful sound.",

For not having any external speakers connected, the sound quality is great. I have it connected in my living room and can hear it from my bedroom while I'm getting ready. You can hook up external speakers if you'd like to, so that's also a cool option. All in all, I give this a 5 star rating.

I've also used it on walks where I clip it to my key chain around my neck. The only con I can say is that of course for it's size, you're not getting thumpy or heavy bass, so if you're a bass head, then this speaker might not be for you. On the flip side, the sound quality is clear and crisp, with no distortion as high volumes. I also bought a case for the speaker to keep it protected. The speaker also comes with an auxiliary cable wrapped around it if you want to use it for older mp3 players. Overall, I'd say JBL knows what they're doing when it comes to sound quality.

At least the bass that is present isn't distorted. The bass and highs sound very good, but the mids might be a little low, but again the speaker sounds really good. The speaker is loud enough for a small room, but wouldn't fill up a large room. The speaker is definitely beautiful and the clip is nice and sturdy. The material it is made out of feels nice to the touch and seems to be high quality. One thing to note, this may be different than some Bluetooth headphones you may be used to regarding the built-in audio cord/cable. The Sony Bluetooth headphones I have are not required to be turned on or connected via Bluetooth to anything if I have an audio cable plugged in to them directly. That is not the case with this speaker though. Even if I have the speaker connected via the audio cable to an MP3 player, it must be turned on and it will automatically pair/connect with your phone. This can be annoying if you are using a separate MP3 player and a phone call comes in to your phone which was previously paired to the speaker. Not a deal breaker, but something to make note of.",

I placed masking tape over the controls writing the letters U, D, P, BT to help me learn the location of controls. The little indicator light blinks slowly for power with wire and faster for power with Bluetooth. I like the fact that the speaker does have a power switch. I am displeased with the attached.3.5mm input cable, as I think that sooner or later the cable will fail and I will have to throw the speaker away. I have taped the wire to the back of the speaker inside its well to reduce strain. I would love to see a3.5 mm input port as found on some other speakers. This is a nice, lightweight and full-sounding speaker that I attach to my Fire tablet or phone finger-strap.",

While it does lack some bass, I fully expected it to, considering the size of the package, but for an average music-listener it's not too much of a loss. The mids and highs are vibrant; I love watching videos on my phone while connected to this speaker. My main reason for my purchase of this little guy, however, came down to practicality. I'm a fairly clumsy person, so I wanted something that could withstand the elements and a handful of falls. This speaker is perfect for that: it's truly waterproof, so I don't have to worry about it getting wet in the Seattle rain or the shower, and it's rugged as hell. I have yet to drop it, but I have confidence that it'll survive any drops from a reasonable height. The carabiner clip and the built-in aux cord make this speaker all the more convenient! I may have to buy a second just to mess with the daisy chaining capabilities. A very worthwhile product!",

Currently I've been using it with my desktop computer since I'm in the middle of a move and it pumps sound out very well.

After a second use I was beginning to get complimens from my friend for being loud for it's size. I stopped using it for a week and on the third use the speaker stopped playing so I thought it needed to be charged but to my surprise it never turned back on.

Beyond the convenient Bluetooth connectivity, it also has an (out) aux sound chord for plugging into other none-Bluetooth capable devices such as older iPods. I use mine for connecting to my iPhone or older iPod for on-the-go movie time while camping. There is a reason I see this device sold everywhere - it's got more sound per pound.

I really like the JBL brand, they have good customer service and I personally believe they sound great and are great quality without the crazy price tag. I have two JBL FLIP 3's that I was using for hikes and fishing before I got this but ever since buying this guy I have left them at home for use in the back yard (sorry neighbors). The clip on the top makes it extremely easy to clip onto your bag or your fishing vest and the fact that it is waterproof AND floats is equally amazing. The battery life is pretty impressive for the size of the device and the amount of volume it puts out. I believe I'm getting about 6 hours if its fully charged and I have the thing turned all the way up. Another added benefit of the speaker is that if you have a friend with a 2nd CLIP 2 or you are like myself and have multiples then you can wirelessly sync them together and play the music even louder. If you are always traveling and want something that is portable or you just want quality without breaking the bank then check this guy out. You will not be disappointed!",

                "review_text": "Got this for X-mas, terrific little speaker!!! I've had the original JBL micro for the past 4 years and needed an upgrade. My micro was not holding a charge for very long anymore...after 4 years of regular use, not bad at all and no complaints! The clip 2 will double my old JBL micros playtime from 4hrs to up to 8hrs of play!!! Love that the clip 2 is water proof, shock resistant and very portable. Sound is perfect for my needs especially when you consider the size of this thing. It's a very \"JBL\" sounding speaker, meaning it is very bright with decent bass, not a warm sound like a Bose speaker. For my use though this is perfect for cycling, by the pool and outdoors in general as it projects the sound well. Only bummer is that the bottom is not flat like my micro so it does not stand upright nor does it have a kickstand to accomplish this. I'll make due anyhow. The clip is convenient as well, attaches to almost anything. Great little speaker for the $$$",

Pros: Reasonable price, and worth it! Strong bass, clear sound. Very mobile, tough skin. Bluetooth or headphone jack connection. USB rechargeable (About 6 hours/charge) Connects to my Android phone quickly and easily Cons: Kinda rubbery coating gets dirty pretty fast, looks dingy (but easy to clean) It doesn't do a great job of telling you that the battery is getting low, it just shuts off. Only about 6 hours of use per full charge (at full volume with Bluetooth connection) - Overall I recommend this product! I keep it in my purse so I'm ready to \"Shake It Off\" whenever the need arises :-D",

AOMAIS ball speaker package: USB charging cable, Aux-in cable, carabineer and float accessory.It has everything you want, definitely worthwhile.

I own two of these, one I gave to my mom as standalone speaker, thats the 3 stars. But my second one i have plugged directly into my stereo system so this effectively acts as a Bluetooth receiver for any device. I play my music through this which is plugged into the stereo so I get the full sound. Its good for that but you don't need the $50 thing to just use it as a Bluetooth receiver anyway. Its ok, you won't return it but maybe look for another one in the $75 range if you want better sound quality",

I've bought like 3 different rubbish, no-name Bluetooth speakers in the past, but we use a bigger JBL unit at my work and it's awesome. Sooo, I splurged on this thing for myself and it's...also pretty awesome! It's not as powerful as the tube-shaped ones they make and it won't make any audiophile swoon (bass sounds a little blown out), but it's easy to use and reasonably powerful for the size. The hook is handy for attaching it to furniture or even a belt-loop on your pants. I will lose its connection if you wander too far from the device you're transmitting from like any such speaker, but it reconnects very quickly when you're in range again. I also like that it makes a little noise when its battery is running low.",

You can use to call through, it sounds fine to me but the other person will hear themselves as they are talking to you. That's fine as its main purpose isn't to be used as Bluetooth for phone call. What really bugs me is the minus volume button. All the other buttons have a very audiable click and you can feel the button being depressed, but the minus volume button doesn't have that click sound or feel. Also the other buttons are 1 hand operational while the minus button I have to use 2 hands to push it. Also I'm not a small guy I'm 6ft 240# and go to the gym 6 days a week. I feel like I might have got a defective one where they actually forgot to but the button on the minus volume and that's why I have to push so hard. If thats how its suppose to be its a bad design it hurts my fingers to lower the volume. Its like trying to load that last cartridge in brand new magazine if you know what I mean lol",

It is a decent amount bigger than the last JBL Clip but is not too big or awkward and is also more sleek. The buttons are setup differently as well but overall are better because you can feel them without looking. The sound is much better than I expected from such a small speaker. The quality is clearer and there is actually some bass that can be felt/heard. I mostly use it on bike rides, while working out, in the shower or just generally on the go and the sound is perfect for all those scenarios. The carabiner feels sturdy and is bigger than on the last one so you can clip it to more things. The battery life seems pretty good. I used it a few hours a day for about 4/5 days off the original charge that it came with. I also like the fact that you can see the battery life on iOS (iPhone 6S.) I haven\u2019t tested it in water but will update with any changes/issues.",

I am no audiophile - Mid tones, vocal are great, say Adele or Jason Mraz, (but not roy orbison) bass is decent but the moment there is music and a variety of instruments it feels more like noise the whole quality goes down. Its NOT bad at all but instead of spending $60 on this I would rather try a different brand that is lot cheaper and has decent reviews. Also those that are sold for $45/49 are Factory Re-Certified - I dont mind fact re-certified but it should have been explicitly mentioned, it was not obvious to me, but the factory re-certified is right on the box direct from JBL (see pic) - but this can be used for as a price match at your local store :) your mileage may vary.",

I wanted a powerful speaker and own a JBL Clip 2 already. This little round speaker is listed as 3 Watts. I got an Oontz Angle 3 Ultra OontZ Angle 3 ULTRA Portable Bluetooth 4.2 Speaker: Excellent Stereo Sound Rich Bass 14Watt Loud Volume 100' Bluetooth Range, Play to two together, Splashproof, by Cambridge SoundWorks which is listed at 14 Watts.Same price at 3W vs. 14W? The little JBL Clip 2 is perceptibly equally loud and has better high volumes tolerance. The sound is stable at maximum volume unlike the other speaker. I've gotten it in the rain but haven't used it in the shower. I like my electronics to be waterproof regardless. This clip is ingeniously placed...all mobile speakers should have handles. Great travel speaker. Most of all, the sound quality is so far unmatched against the Altec-Lansing mini-Lifejacket, Philips BT3500B/37 and the Ooztz 3 Ultra. Much clearer with less distortion with just 3W. I'd like to compare this to comparably Bose SoundLink Micro Waterproof Bluetooth speaker - Black . If anyone has done a comparison, leave a comment please. I found out it's not worth using bluetooth at all and that just plugging a double ended 1.5mm headphone cord into the CAR STEREO AUX jack and the other end into the iPad/iPhone. *Set the phone/iPad volume to max and use the car stereo volume control to adjust volume. It is, hands down, the easiest, cheapest way to play music in a car with an iPhone or iPad. I'll use this one while hiking and transport it back and forth to my desk where it hangs. The other's I'll sell.",

These were namely the lack of water resistance and the poor quality clip. The speaker sounds great, and can fill a small room. I love it and use it daily. The only \"qualm\" I have with this one is that the status light is on the bottom, not on the top like the old model.

Personally I make a lot of smoothies with items such as yogurt and protein powder added in. The trouble is it has this very long three bladed pillar that extends almost all the way to the lid from the bottom. If you are trying to add in a powder or something like yogurt, it catches on all the blades, which means that unless you planned to fill the blender all the way to the top, that stuff won't make it into your smoothie and will instead stick and you have to scrape it in and blend again. Also it's ridiculously powerful even on the low setting, which again isn't good if you only want to make less than maximum capacity, since it splatters everywhere and you either lose a lot, or have to sit there and scrape it all out with a spatula. Overall it's just a lot of trouble unless you are using it to full capacity every time.",

I make smoothies and blend cauliflower for mash sometimes, but the primary reason for purchase was to make bulletproof coffee every morning. Upon first use for BP coffee it produced froth like I have never had and it was truly delicious. The reason I landed on this blender is because after doing research for the best blender specifically for BP coffee this was recommended if you are not willing to splurge for a Vitamix or Blendtec. At this point, I may have to do that, because even this blender has already cracked and is leaking after less than a month's use. Luckily I am still in the return frame for Amazon so they are sending me a new one (I also purchased warranty). Upon doing more research, people say in order to keep blenders from cracking when making BP coffee, you must release the air pressure out of the blender by taking off the top after no more than blending for 10 seconds. Then you can put the top back on and blend for additional time if needed. I am going to try this method, and hopefully it will keep it from cracking.",

                "review_text": "We've been battling our blender's ability to crush ice for years. Since our kiddos are huge smoothie fans and we enjoy frozen drinks, we needed a blender that could get the job done without leaving chunks of ice and a metallic smell in the air. After reading the stellar reviews and watching the impressive ice-crushing infomercial, we decided to invest in a Ninja. When this particular model had a flash sale ($53.49), we pulled the trigger. Pros: 1) It crushes ice and frozen fruit like a powerhouse, leaving no chunks behind. 2) The blade design is brilliant. Easy to insert and remove with one fluid movement. (Just don't forget to put blade in before blending!) 3) Blade removal makes pouring, scraping, and cleaning easy. (Be careful, it's sharp.) 4) Secured top system locks out leaks and splashes. 5) Flip spout allows small food items and liquid to be added while blending. 6) Has the ability to pulse or run blender hands free. 7) Holds a TON of liquid. Great for lots of people. Cons: 1) If not full, dry items (spinach) will jump to the top and stick to the sides requiring stopping and stirring manually. 2) Does not pair with individual blending cups as recommended by Amazon. 3) Cord is too short. Difficult to accommodate to outlet. Given the $54 price tag, this blender is well worth the money when entertaining and blending for groups. It gets the job done quickly and efficiently and crushes ice like magic. Cleanup is easy - simply rinse the extremely sharp blade and air dry on counter and throw the pitcher in the dishwasher. Because of the excellent top-lock feature and no openings on pitcher base, little to no residue gets on the base. I love this blender, but if I had it to do all over again, I would bypass this model and order an all-in-one Ninja blender that has the option of using smaller cups for individual drinks. Our smoothie blending would take much less time if the area inside the pitcher/cup was filled with more food/liquid so that sides didn't need to be scraped of spinach. Plus, we'd have the added individual smoothie cups for our two children, allowing them to choose the ingredients inside. While they're battling over smoothie choices, my husband and I could enjoy blending frozen margaritas in a bigger pitcher. Amazon - please stop pairing it with the \"Tritan Nutri Ninja cups.\" They're not compatible with this unit. Bottom line: Ninja packs a punch I've never seen with other blenders. It's my new brand of choice.",

Obviously, much improved. I've been excited to get up this past week to make my coffee smoothies before work! It is loud, I hope that my neighbor doesn't hear it downstairs, but I don't know if there is such thing as a blender that can quietly chop up ice. One of my cats watches me prep my smoothie but runs when I turn it on, and the other cat runs over to see what is making that noise, so it's tolerable for a non-fraidy cat. I've read reviews of complaints that the blade doesn't snap in and people have cut their hands, so I was nervous about that. But I sat down and read the instruction manual all the way through and it states it a bunch of times that the blade doesn't snap in and to lift it out before you pour with the lid off, so I've paid very close attention to that! Always be sure to read instructions! Reviews have complained that the blender somehow broke within weeks of purchasing it. If you read the instructions, you'll see to register it within 10 days and they have a one year warranty. I highly recommend this blender and it's super affordable! My Mom said her Vitamix heats up whatever she puts in it, so I was worried my smoothie might come out warm, but it stays cold. Maybe it's a better blender for 1/4 of the cost? Pro-tip (from Mom): After using, fill the blender with warm water a little bit away from the top with a tiny amount of dish soap and run on high and it washes out the pitcher. :)",

Blends so quickly and thoroughly! Can add in all the ingredients at once without worry of clogging or anything. I use it at low speed always because even at that setting it gets the job done quick. Now, I\u2019m certain some of you are now anxious about the horror stories you\u2019re seeing on the reviews of cut fingers and toes. I was, too...but my mom bought this for me and swore by it because she has one. I\u2019m starting to think the injuries are MAINLY user error. Don\u2019t try hand washing these blades, first of all. You will likely cut yourself due to slippery metal. I wash mine by adding hot water, soap and blending it a few times. Never had an issue with residue. Granted, I don\u2019t have a dish washer so if you do, use that. Now, as for the blades popping out, yes they can easily do that. But only if you\u2019re tipping the blender upside down without the lid on, or properly locked on. If you have to pour your smoothie or whatever out, there\u2019s a specific opening in the lid for you to do this safely! Don\u2019t remove the entire lid and pour! This will definitely make the blade pop out.",

The top blade is almost at the top. No matter what you put in, it grabs it and grinds it up; frozen, leafy, hard, soft, whatever. You never have to push the load down. This blender makes perfect smoothies out of frozen fruit without any extra fiddling. Leafy stuff like kale can be added in at the top and it just sucks it down and grinds up. Amazing! It has lots of power. It does not slow down on a full load of frozen fruit. Even though the container is plastic, it seems very strong. I have had my blender over 1 year, and the container is in perfect condition; no cracks or scratches. When it does frozen fruit, it makes a loud noise like rocks are being thrown around inside, but then it quiets down after everything is ground into smaller pieces. The best smoothy maker ever!",

Generally if ice or frozen fruits are involved you can hear when it\u2019s done.

It's not nearly the power of my Vitamix (1000w vs 1380w) but for what I need to do it has worked fantastically. I mainly use it for grinding up fresh coconut meat to make coconut oil and for that task so far it has worked fantastically. I like that it doesn't get air pockets like my Vitamix used to get all the time. The only thing I don't like about it is that I can't take off the top of the pitcher while it's blending like I could with my Vitamix...I liked being able to take a spatula and push the stuff sticking on the top/sides down while it's blending...now I have to turn it off to do this.

First of all, look at the price and watts on this! 1,000 watts for soooo much less than the Vitamix. The newest Vitamix is 2.2 HP (1640 Watts) for over $600! Yikes. Don't get me wrong, they are a great machine, but for those of us who don't need programmable timers, hot soup and ultra silky smooth baby food, this Ninja is the best out there. This does just about everything the high priced one does. I use this for smoothies, this can take anything you give it and blend it right up. I make frozen fruit yogurts, (add the frozen fruit to fat free yogurt (I use home made almond milk yogurt). I use it for banana \"icecream\". Whip up frozen banana pieces, takes a couple seconds with this, then add peanut butter, chocolate, nuts, whatever you want. (I use Betty Lou's powdered fat free peanut butter). Of course you have to be careful handling the ultra sharp blades. I remove the blade assembly by the tip and set it inside the sink. I continue to hold just the top tip and use a bottle brush to clean the blades. I carefully set it back in the clean blender and let it air dry. It doesn't rust. I also make my own sauces and dressings. The grand kids like the \"snow cones\" this Ninja makes. I use diluted, sugar free Torani, and DaVinci coffee syrups, (brands Amazon carries). I especially like the simplicity of the buttons. Low, medium and high. Full speed and pulse. What more does anyone need? You just can't get a more powerful, quality blender than this for the price. Update: Well, it did blend the soft frozen fruit (banana, strawberries and blueberries), but I later tried mango and pineapple. Not so good. Chunks no matter how long I blended. I guess it has limitations.",

Recently, one of those 4 plastic corners broke off unexpectedly. Furthermore, this blender has never blended ice well. I would not purchase this blender again.",

When we returned the 2nd to the same place, we just got our money back. I called Ninja to speak to someone to see if they had any suggestions, the first person said, \"Since you went thru 2 of them in such a short time, it is obvious to me that you used it wrong.\" I let her know that we did not ever put them in the dishwasher or use harsh soap, etc. It was supposed to be able to crush ice and that is when it leaked the most. She suggested that we purchase another one and also the 200 dollar warranty that is good for 90 days. We only paid 80 dollars for it and the warranty does not cover mailing the product back and forth to be fixed. I tried to call back again to see if I could leave a complaint with their survey and she hung up on me. When I tried to call back, they had blocked my number. Because I am bilingual, I called again and chose the Spanish line. This gentleman only offered me to create an account with them so I could receive emails for promotions. I asked if I could leave a complaint and he said there wasn't any way to do that. I went on their website and there wasn't away to leave a complaint. My only other option was to leave one here on Amazon so other people will know that they don't stand behind their products. Very sad these days that no one seems to care about the consumer; only how to make more money from you. My next step is to write a letter by snail-mail since their website does not allow you to leave comments.",

                "review_text": "This is the first time my three young children are all napping in the afternoon. Of all the (many many) things I could be doing right now, I chose to write this review, because I HATE THIS BLENDER so much. Let's count the ways, shall we? 1) The blade and blade holder is huge and does not allow larger chunks of fruit or vegetables to be placed inside the container. 2) The blades are all placed on the side, and none in the center bottom of the blade holder, meaning there is no centrifugal force, meaning that the blades scatter the components of your smoothie all over the container, instead of towards the center bottom of the container. This means that you cannot open the lid to add more liquid or fruit as it is blending. 3) The blades are not locked into place and fall out when you pour 4) It is unnecessarily loud, heavy, and clunky. 5) It does not blend properly. It is about as effective as a mortar and pestle. So in the spirit of fairness, I gave this thing two stars as it does sort of blend things and if you want to use it to make fruit smoothies, I suppose it does the job. However, if you want to make any creamy soups, vegetable smoothies, or sauces you are better off with a regular $30 Oster. My cheap blender does a more thorough job and gets less dirty. I finally thought I was rid of this nightmare when it (after only a year, with maybe bi weekly use) it crapped out on me. The manufacturer offered to send me a new motor, but I was to pay the $30 shipping. Thanks but no thanks. Verdict: Not even as good as a cheap blender. Does kind of blend.",

                "review_text": "I saw several reviews of this blender accompanied by pictures of lacerations. I thought to myself, \"I've been using food processors and other kitchen tools that have sharp, removable blades for years with no problems....\" Well, I have managed to avoid any injuries, however I have more sympathy for those people than I did before for the following two reasons: 1) the three tiers of blades mean that there is no safe way to dry this without blades sticking up in the air (unlike a knife or a food processor blade where you can lay it flat). Standing it upright the way it sits in the carafe will make it prone to tipping over. 2) the top part where you must hold the blade is small, tapered, and difficult to grip firmly with wet hands. My other complaint is that because of the three-tiered blade assembly, it is impossible to safely push things down into the blender. I make smoothies five days a week and the kale that I used to just press down to the bottom so that other ingredients would fit, I now have to blend for a moment to make room. Not a huge chore, but it slows me down. I don't love the locking lid and I fear the plastic moving parts will break before the blender wears out, but I've been using this several days a week for five months and that's still working fine. Bottom line, it blends reliably, I'm not going to replace it, but I wouldn't buy it again.",

In seconds I had crushed ice. The next step was to instruct my daughter to NEVER-EVER put her hands inside the container, no matter what, even if is not on. She looked at me with big open eyes....yes NEVER! These are extra sharp blades. This morning I prepared my first smoothie, kale, carrots, pear, honey, banana and ice. I will not say the drink is delicious, but the blender did his job. In seconds all the fruits and veggies were crushed and blended. You will not be disappointed. Go for it.

I ran it on High speed for a while, nothing. Poured it all out and back in to make sure nothing was sticking to the sides (and things were!). Poured it all back in and put it on High once more. Poured it into my cup and took a sip of my chewy greens. BLAH! It doesn't even come close to my Nutri Bullet. I poured a some into my nutribullet and first try it was nice and smooth... greens?

                "review_text": "This is the best blender I have ever had. I know there are probably better blenders out there, but for me, I call this the best blender in the world! I make a breakfast smoothie with ice, bananas, almond milk, and a chocolate powder every morning. I no longer have to slice my bananas. I put a frozen banana in this blender whole and with one hit of the pulse button, it is blown to pieces. I could be done blending a smoothie in 20 seconds as opposed to 1 minute with a cheap $20 blender. I\u2019ve also used this blender for cooking. I had a recipe that called for an egg with ricotta cheese blended together. In seconds I had a creamy, pudding consistency mixture. One time I was out of bread crumbs so I took stuffing and pulsed it around a few times. It turned those chuncks of stuffing to dust. I can\u2019t speak highly enough about this blender. Everyone should have one! I\u2019ve had it for several months now and I am obviously still so grateful to have it in my life lol. Lastly, to reiterate on previous reviews, the blade nozzle is not attached to the blender. If your pour without the lid on, the blade is going to fall out, and you run the risk of injury. However, if you follow the directions you\u2019ll be good to go.",

I guess The lid doesnt fit properly or maybe its the rubber on the lid that isnt good. EITHER way in order for it not to splash out, i need to tightly hold down the lid while it blends. AND WHEN ITS TIME TO POUR, im supposed to easily lift the corner and pour. HOWEVER when i pour it comes pouring out around the whole lid making a huge mess.

The lid does not stay down tight on its own causing the machine to stop blending and I have to hold down the lid with some force in order to use. I do like it for times when I still want to leave bigger chunks such as when making salsa. But as my only blender it does not cut it. Also, it is hard to clean the underside of the pitcher (somehow I have stuff under there?) and the lid has a crevice in the pour spout that is hard to get clean. :(",

However, they should be; they are chopping up sometimes hard and/or frozen fruit or veggies. I love the pour lid - it makes it so easy to pour straight into a glass without too much stuff pouring \"over\" the glass. I have to say I still have a habit of placing my hand on top when blending. The locking lid ensures that I don't need to do this, but some habits are hard to break. Well done, Ninja! I use this primarily for my morning smoothies.",

Unfortunately the square shape means that powder gets in the corners and stays there. Also, despite using every possible setting, I can't get it to blend the ice well. I always feel the need to the shake a bit as bigger ice chips always remain. I always hand wash (which is easy - yay) this immediately after using and after just a month, condensation is collecting in the handle. Not cool. I do like the spout opening in the lid, which ensures that big blobs of shake or smoothie don't make messes as you pour.

                "review_text": "I'm a healthcare professional and bought this after researching the competition (i.e., \"Vita-Mix). After reading through a gazillion comments and reviews (including CR who rates the Ninja #2) I opted for the lower priced Ninja. I have used mine twice a day for the 6 weeks I have owned it, I use it for making smoothies. I blend for health, I have a morning fruit and berry smoothie and I have an afternoon veggie smoothie. Blending is a really convenient way to get in all your servings of fruit and veggies each day without removing the (very important) fiber. So far, I love my Ninja. I have had stuff made with a Vita Mix in the past, but have never done a side by side comparison, though I can think of a few differences that are meaningful for me. One, the Vita Mix generates heat. They use it as a selling feature, that you can use it to make soups, but I like my smoothies cold, so it's not something I look for in a blender. Secondly, Vita Mix seems to win in all the comparisons with Ninja on smoothness, or thoroughness of blending. The only reason I knocked one star off the Ninja is because I have noticed that my smoothies are a bit chewier after several weeks of blender use. I attribute that to the fact that Ninja relies (apparently) on their sharp blades, which naturally dull with use-especially when blending frozen berries or ice (which both of my smoothies contain). I've noticed a subtle change in texture, no chunks, but definitely not a fine blend. My understanding is that Vita Mix has dull blades that work for years, they do not rely so much on sharpness as they do on speed? The other thing (in addition to heat) that you get with a Vita Mix is aeration (foam), which I do not notice with the Ninja. My smoothies are full of fruit and veggies, so they are full of fiber. If you are okay with having some noticeable fiber in your blend over time, the Ninja is a great deal at about 1/5 the cost. If that matters to you, expect that you will have it in time (I started to notice it after about 25 blends). The blender cleans very easily and is simple to use. I've never had to remove the top to tamp stuff down and I use 3 cups of leafy greens like kale and arugula, as well as whole carrots, celery, apples, and never have chunks. Overall it's a great machine. I cannot rate longevity since I've only had it 6 weeks, but so far I'm very pleased. Update: It's January 2018, I owned the Ninja about 3 months and ended up getting a Vita Mix. I still stand by my original review, but there is a difference. The Ninja starts out pretty great, but then over time things do no blend as well. I drink 2 smoothies a day (one veggie, one fruit), so I use it a minimum of 2x a day. Over time I started calling my Ninja smoothies: \"grainies.\" The blades start out very sharp, and the technology depends on that, but they dull with use and it shows in the results. The Vita Mix does not depend on blade sharpness, but power, it pummels everything to pieces (itty bitty pieces). I am amazed at the flour I can make with it. Also, the heat i mentioned is not a factor but a feature. Most things are blended in less than a minute (35 seconds often), so nothing really gets warm unless you leave it on in order to generate heat. The Ninja is a good blender, especially for the cost, but I don't think one can fairly compare it to a Vita Mix, it's like comparing apples and oranges.",

If attempted to make any coffee drinks or a more liquid smoothie it comes out the bottom.

The blender fits under my cupboard so I don't lose any of my counterspace. I also love the built in safety features of a locking lid and container. It is not a loud blender at all. It is very good at destroying the super frozen items I blend weekly. This blender is plain out AMAZING! I am so glad I received it. P.s. using the blender properly is not difficult. There is a reason why it has locking features. If you don't know, read the instructions.",

There was a Krups that was a wedding present and lasted about 15 years followed by a much nicer Breville that lasted maybe 2 years total. It was the cheaper of the two similar models, but out of the box, I could tell that the motor was under-powered, especially at it's higher settings, it smelled smoky, even new and eventually it burned out. So, for it's replacement I landed here. Didn't want to spend several hundred dollars, but went for wattage/hp this time and it shows. Confidence inspiring and I'm sure will handle whatever I throw at it. I make smoothies almost every day with frozen fruit and it handles with ease. The blades are crazy sharp and stack up through the pitcher and seem to pull the contents down, so everything gets crushed/blended. The pitcher locks to the base and the lid locks down on the pitcher and the motor won't run unless both are locked into place. I think this is a safety feature, because it could easily mince up a hand full of fingers if you got them in there. The blade stack lifts out, which makes cleaning easy. After about a month of moderate-heavy use, I'm impressed and happy. This is a very good blender.",

This is why- when I first used it I was amazed how powerful and fantastic this blender was. I was making ceasar salad dressing for a family dinner. It made quick work of a usually long process. Which is exactly why I bought it. However, with other blenders I usually take the lid off and pour my substance out of the container. When I did this the huge blade fell out and cut my finger very badly leaving blood in my dressing. I too was traumatized like others had said but I was so impressed with the results I went back and figured out what I did wrong. The main problem was I needed to REMOVE THE BLADE from the container as it is not affixed to it. It is just \"sitting\" there. Once I was aware of that everything was fine and I love it now. Only thing is, the directions should have large lettering or warnings about this and they do not! So BEWARE!",

First off the power of it is amazing compared to all the other blenders I've used such as Oyester, Black and Decker, and a couple others. It's power is far stronger than all the others I've used, but what's more amazing about it is that it's so much quieter than the others. It's a win, win situation for sure. This blender is also a food processor so the range of things that can be done with it is limitless. I enjoy juicing fruits and vegetables, but don't like typical juicers because it throws away all the pulp, and that is where the vast majority of nutrients are. With the Ninja I get the best quality of fresh juices, smoothies, and protein drinks. I also really enjoy making my baby's food, and with the Ninja it truly makes it a breeze. Only the Best for my little one! I have also made soup with it by blending my steamed veggies and then heated on the stove. The cleanup is so much easier than any other blender I've used as well. I have been using my Ninja for already 5 months and it works like a charm. This product is something I would recommend to anyone!",

No indication that it is fully charged. Inconvenient. 2. The opener has no window so you can see it work. I didn't think this would bother me, but since my old one was clear, I guess it does. Otherwise, I would have given this unit the fifth star. Hopefully I'll be irritated by the two little issues for a long time. :)",

I also love the seal cutter that allows me to beautifully remove the seal. Love that it fits right into the back of the stand. The only reason why I docked 1 star is because it took several tries of pressing the button up and down to get the cork out.

I loved this product so much I bought multiple for gifts for friends/family members. 6 months later, the down button (which removes the cork from the bottle) stops working, knowing that Oster aka Sunbeam Products aka Jarden Consumer Solutions has a 1 year limited warranty (stated in product manual) I wasn't worried. I emailed customer service about my issue, 3 weeks later I got a response requesting information in order to process the return. The same day I respond to the email with all the information asked, another week goes by without a response. I email customer service to make sure they received my email with all my information and not only did they let me know they did receive my email but the product was \"no longer covered under warranty\". I responded to customer service with the exact words from their handbook stating that their product has a one year warranty and have yet to get a response. So if you are thinking about purchasing this wine opener, keep scanning for something else. This is not the one for you. TLDR; Don't buy this product, it is not made well and customer service isn't interested in fulfilling their warranty.",

In the meantime, this piece of fitness equipment is easy to build, install, and use making regular practice an attainable goal. It\u2019s also a great price. Word of advice: Make sure the top frame of your door (also called casing, lentil or header) is not more than 3.5\u201d tall or this unit will not fit. If you have decorative molding or a cornice on top of the frame (see pic), it will not fit no matter the size (the molding will prevent a strong purchase between the wall and the bar.) Our vintage home has these types of moldings throughout except in the renovated third floor space with 2.5\u201d door frames with doors. With or without the metal clip, you can remove the bar to close the door as well as to use the unit for floor exercises like pushups. We bought a folding step stool so that our tween son can reach the bar without jumping up. That kind of motion will definitely dislodge the unit leading to injury. The bar is listed for up to 300 pounds. Our individual weights are half of that, but I do not allow the boys to use this without an adult spotter. If you use this bar with care and caution - especially when used by kids - this pull-up bar may be a good addition to your in-home gym.",

This is where it all goes downhill. Even though the bolts had a square notch that seats into the plastic bar, it is weak and will not hold the bolt when you begin to tighten it. So basically....it just keeps spinning and eventually rounds the plastic hole. Needles to say, I was pretty disappointed and I have ordered a different brand that will hopefully be more robust than this bar. Half a star for trying, but this is going back.",

The description states it \"is designed to fit residential doorways 24 to 32 inches wide, with doorway trim or molding up to 3.5 inches wide.\" My door is 32 inches wide and my molding is 3.5 inches wide. It should also specify that it will not safely fit doorways greater than a certain thickness. Every doorway in my house, including the molding thickness, is 8 inches thick. At this thickness and with my molding width, the plastic bar barely squeezes onto the molding and hangs halfway off. To be fair if I put weight on the Iron Gym, the pressure pushes the bar further onto the frame however I just don't feel safe using it in this situation.",

I needed something to put in my door way so that I could use an autistic swing for my kids, as well as other things for my ADHD child to climb up. So I got this and since the bars are a little to wide for swings to be attached to it. So I used Ankle Straps for Cable Machines that had 2 metal hoops on it to make the swing be able to hook to the pull up bar. We also use a child's climb rope which nicely hangs their as well and has never budged from the area where it rests on. It was easy to put together, and since the weight limit is 300 I feel 100% safe that my kids and their toys that are on there will not come down. It is very sturdy and I am not going to lie at first I put all my weight on while it was on the doorway there just to make sure the molding wasn't going to come down (just because I am paranoid about things like that when evolving kids) and it has never budged once, I weigh about 200 pounds. So over all great for our needs!",

I question how effective dips would be on this since it seems a bit too low to do a full movement dip. It has handled my weight (145 lbs) well and has not started to bend or sag. I do have a couple of complaints, the padding on the bar where it meets the door frame should be thicker. Mine degraded without me noticing and the actual solid bar started to push against my doorframe. Now my doorframe is damaged. I recommend putting a sock between the doorframe and the bar to provide more padding for protection. My other complaint is that the flat piece that goes against the wall above the doorframe could discolor your wall. It did mine. I recommend putting something in between the wall and the flat plastic part to prevent against this. Other than that, this is a well built product that performs as advertised.",

I made a game plan; every week I would push my max and add five more pull-ups a few minutes after. Since using this routine I have noticed serious changes. I increased muscle mass, lost weight, and was even able to tone some pre-existing muscles. Since I\u2019ve bought this product I have lost a majority of my gynecomastia, gained 2-3 inches on my biceps, toned all my upper body muscles, and even set a path for a six pack! After using this bar I can confidently say that I have increased my max amount of pull-ups from 0 to 20 comfortably.

The long bar that crosses the doorway is two separate pieces that fit together in the center. They don't fit tightly. I've tried altering the bolts of the cross pieces to get a better fit without success. The metal ends only overlap by about an inch and there is bend as you put weight on the bar. Once I realized this was an issue, I looked more carefully and saw that other bars have bolts to hold the middle pieces together. I think that would make the whole device safer and that you should definitely look for a bar with these center bolts. Maybe I can find a metal bar to fit inside the center pieces for added stability.

The product itself may be FANTASTIC, but if you can't even properly complete the assembly process, then it's useless. What should be the easiest assembly has wrong parts for doing so. As a result of NOT being able to properly tighten the bolts provide. The wall protecting plastic bar is made of poor material in which the bolts easily stripped the plastic when trying to even loosely tighten it. On top of that, there's no way of reversing the bolt tightening process (I was going to switch out the bolts for personal ones that contain a screwdriver access head so that you can hold the bolt in place on one end while tightening on the other...the ones provided don't allow for that) , but as a result of not having that, I can't switch out the bolt. This leaves me with a loose dangling arm, which basically means that I can't use the product. Not sure of anyone had this same experience, but I would suggest that Iron Gym switch out some of its assembly parts for more logical and sturdy materials. Unfortunate bc I was looking forward to using this, and now I can't even return this product for a refund.",

Therefore, I sometimes have an itching to get in a workout but not spend 3-4 hours in the gym. The pull bar does the trick. After I brush my teeth or if I'm waiting for water to boil when cooking, I throw up this bar on the door and crank out maybe 15 to feel the burn. I could use it more so for a full workout because of the push up handles, but I think I like it the most is because I can really get the body working in a short set of pull ups. It's also portable and easy to store. Some folks leave their bar up at all times, but I have my girlfriend in the house and I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate the vibe of a pull up bar in front of the bedroom. That's why it's great that I can easy take it off and store it in the closest without taking too much space. Overall not a bad tool for a decent price",

My fridge was new and this is the first time I had to change the filter. Whatever filter was already IN the fridge had a terrible plastic taste so I was concerned that it would stay around with the new filter. To my big surprise it was much better. I only drink spring water and have drank from the filter and liked it- it had no after taste or plastic taste anymore. I did have some air bubbles following the filter change but it does go away after a little while. I made sure to run the water before the first use (as directed) although I didn't measure the water so was it exactly however many gallons??? No idea! I am very happy with my purchase and will only order this filter for my Whirpool fridge.",

The new funky taste appeared when we replaced this same EveryDrop model filter with the new one. The old EveryDrop one still had 2% of use on it according to our fridge, but we replaced it with this new one and the water immediately tasted weird. I went on Amazon to see if I could get a free replacement but I'd have to return the old one. That is not easy to do. It's wet, it's been used and is still being used until we can replace it. So, I've just been waiting for enough time to pass that buying another fridge filter makes financial sense. Not sure I'll buy this one though.",

Each one would fit fine but I could not get any pressure at all, just a hammering sound. This official Whirlpool filter worked right away, producing better water flow than I have gotten with any of the other filter manufacturers. I didn't notice any difference in the taste of the water. The filter was troublesome after the first night and I had to adjust it a few more times before it was just right to keep the water flowing. No problems in the month since.

Although I feel that the price for this product is too high, it was one of the only options we'd got to find a filter that would replace our outdated water filter in our fridge. I was hoping to find a water filter branded by either Whirlpool/Amanda or at least the same brand as the filter they've already installed in my fridge. This product was bought because our old filter reached its 6-month limit and after a few months of use, the water change taste. We had no choice but to but a new one and luckily we found this filter which was compatible. After installing, you have to throw out some of the water and ice from the fridge as instructed in the manual. To install, there is this square compartment on the bottom of the fridge (outside). Pull it and the filter pops right out. Replace and push tight to close the compartment. This product was useful but I prefer a lower price for this product.",

Sometimes these will go on sale & we stock up because we have had really good results from this filter. It is true to time. Meaning, I have wrote the dates of the day we replace the filter on the filter itself and each one has lasted us exactly 6-6.5 months & we use it A LOT! it is our main source of water in the house because we are iffy about consuming the tap water! Great purchase. You can truly taste the difference it makes!",

I just remind myself this is helping me sleep in a few minutes and to suck it up. Bottom line: I believe this works so I recommend for those having difficulty sleeping, just remember to start early.

They spend a lot of time on the computer and I'm afraid of the cumulative damage of computer use, TV watching, tablet use, and whatever other blue-light producing products they engage in. If I can cut down on some of the blue-light damage, this is a cost effective and practical way to do it. It fits my 9-year old grandson perfectly but is a bit loose on the 5-year old (who still uses it because it looks cool).They have no graduation. For me, I've been using another blue-light set of glasses that has the +1.50 graduation I need for my vision on computer screens. My ophthalmologist told me it was a great idea and he highly recommended the protection. Basically, you figure the graduation you may need by ordering a level that is half your reading glasses strength. So, since my reading glasses are +3.00.I halved it and got the +1.50 which works perfectly. Does it affect colors? Yes, especially the first few minutes. After that, you forget they're there. If you use your computer for processing photos or designing graphics etc, you might need to, occasionally, lift the glasses up to make sure you're not over-yellowing. But for video watching, computer games, and office documents (Word, Excel, etc) it really doesn't interfere.",

I wear this 2 hours before I go to sleep. It's been only a week so, I don't notice a measurable difference. I'm still getting used to watching a movie without any blues and brushing my teeth with these googles on. After two hours, I'm glad to be able to take them off mostly because they are large and I'm just not used to them. I use a computer for hours but I would not use these to play video games or on the computer. Try blue blocking glasses that aren't as yellow. You'll still get some benefit and not blow out all the blues. I'm glad I tried this product.

They are very comfortable on my small, woman's head, have adjustable temples and fit very close to my face all the way around. The nose bridge on these glasses is molded into the lens and is not quite as comfortable as Smith & Wesson Magnum 3G glasses which have a silicone (?) nose piece but it does interfere less with vision. The lenses wrap around giving good side protection from blue light. These are very nice, inexpensive blue blockers.

I can wear them with minimal lighting inside the house at night and not stumble over anything. It seems as though they really do block only the blue light, leaving all the other light pretty much alone so you can still see. Yes, everything will have an orange tint, but I was able to quickly adjust to it. I feel like it actually improves contrast in some cases. Reading black text on a yellow-ish background from a computer screen is actually easier because my eyes don't strain from the uncomfortable blue light. Highly recommend.",

I use my laptop a lot at night, so I decided not to totally depend on night shift. I looked for glasses that had been \"tested\" and chose these after reading a few reviews. There was a short learning curve to get used to the tint, but really no more than getting used to night shift.",

I continue to watch TV and interact with the family in the house. One hour later, I turn off everything, remove the glass and fall asleep within 3-5 minutes. Previously, I would be awake another 30-45 minutes before falling asleep. After 2 weeks, I found myself staying asleep for longer periods of time. Previously, I was waking up 2-3x a night. Just recently, I started to remove caffeine and sugar after 6pm. This helped even more. Placebo? Not sure, but I know my eyes are no longer burning during the day, I am falling asleep faster (within 3-5 minutes) and out of the past 5 days, I may wake up once in the middle of two different nights and not wake up until the morning for the other 3 nights.

Due to problems (above-and-beyond computer use) with being sensitive to glare, and to night blindness, I also take MacuGuard supplements, and CAN-C eye drops. The combination of these three things have probably saved me from having severe eye problems, as I seemed to be heading that direction.

How often can you say that about a product?! I've suffered with insomnia for years. I couldn't get to sleep easily and once I did, I couldn't stay asleep. I tried melatonin, sleeping pills, meditation, supplements, etc. Nothing worked. I had just about given up when I read an article about success in blocking blue light in the hours before bedtime. I took a chance and bought these which were featured in the article. And, WOW!!! It sounds crazy but these glasses have changed my life. The first night I wore them I slept like a baby! After 3 nights of great sleep, I tested the product by not wearing the glasses. And...back to the insomnia. :-( So, now I've set an alarm on my phone to remind me to put them on at 8:30p every night. By 10:30p, I'm falling asleep whether I want to or not! I've even woken up in the glasses because I fell asleep so soundly wearing them. Seriously, if you have insomnia, BUY THESE! They aren't cute and you may feel silly wearing them. But, when you feel your first good night's sleep after months or years of sleepless agony you'll be sold! I'm buying a second pair to keep in my travel kit.",

So they definitely work, it just isn't particularly pleasant to use them. While they are good for blocking out the blue light from the TV so you can fall sleep more quickly, they aren't suitable for reading because they distort whatever is on the page or screen. The plastic \"lens\" is not optical quality, nor was it made to be. It was made to block blue light, which it does very well. However, if you're looking for something to block blue light when you're READING on your phone, iPad etc, these are most emphatically not a good choice. Buy a better quality pair of blue blocking glasses for that.",

                "review_text": "I can sleep at last! These orange Uvex Skyper glasses worn every evening - in combination with the Luminette Bright Light Theraply Glasses worn every morning - have totally transformed my life! Prior to buying these two items my sleep cycle had been appallingly since uni days. Years of working on a laptop all night in a brightly lit office had ruined my body's ability to regulate its sleep. I'd be bursting with energy at midnight, and then still powering away at dawn. It was easy to stay awake for 36 hours at time, but almost impossible to sleep. Mornings were just awful, and I'd feel lacklustre all day ... until about 7pm when my energy levels would begin to rise again. Over the years I had often tried to reform my sleep, but without any success; clearly, my brain was simply not producing melatonin. A few months ago I decided to start an experiment to see if cutting out blue light at night, and then adding bright blue light in the mornings, could overcome the chronic sleep problems. The science seemed valid, so I hoped it would work on me. I bought both the Uvex Skyper orange glasses (to block blue light in the evenings) and the Luminette glasses (to simulate bright daylight in the mornings) and used both diligently every day as part of a program to reform my sleep. Here's what I experienced. 1. Within a couple of weeks of wearing the Uvex Skyper glasses I started getting sleepy at around 11pm, like normal people do!! 2. After just a few mornings of wearing the Luminette glasses I began to enjoy waking up. I couldn't wait to pop on my \"happy glasses\" as they made me feel wonderful! Now, more than 2 months later, I wake every morning around 7am feeling bright and cheerful. 3. The quality of my sleep has been completely transformed. Only three months ago I would wake every half hour and then lie awake for another two or three hours; now I sleep soundly the whole night through! Based upon my experience, here are the key conclusions I'd to share with others. * If an inability to wind down or fall asleep is your main problem, then the orange Uvex Skyper glasses (around $9) should be your first purchase - because if you can kick-start your melatonin production at night, then you will sleep better and wake happier. * However, if you struggle to wake up and you feel sluggish for hours afterwards, then the Luminette glasses could be transformational for you (as they were for me). I used to hate mornings ... and now I love them! * You still need to be sufficiently self disciplined to use the specs diligently. E.g. if I forget to wear the orange glasses for a few nights, then my old habit of staying awake all night quickly returns. I'm writing this review jointly for the Uvex Skyper Blue Light Blocking Glasses (for evenings) and the Luminette 2 SAD Bright Light Therapy Glasses (for mornings) because I used both over the same time period and it isn't really possible to tell which of them has contributed most to resolving my sleep and wake problems.",

                "review_text": "These glasses do block blue light. The lenses are so dark, they block almost any color of light. I bought these at first for the price. After a few months, my children had gotten to them, cracked the lens (it is a single piece) right down the middle. Later they got to the ear pieces and that was the end of them. I felt that even on the brightest of screens these blocked too much to clearly see, and though the adjustable ear pieces were a nifty feature; all in all they felt more like outdoor construction glasses than anything else. Manufacturing: Cheap plastic. Seriously, they feel like a set of the cheapest Wal-Mart safety glasses. Feel: Uncomfortable to wear, the nose pieces are indelicate and will start to hurt after a while. To see out of them is difficult, and I felt like every time I put them away was the last time I would see them in one piece. Performance: They block light, are slightly oversized so you don't have to worry about fit, and the adjustable ear pieces with the wrap-around side blocking were useful features. However, I feel that being so fragile cancels the usefulness of these features out. Also, I found it difficult to see out of them, so much so that I found myself frequently removing them to get a better look at my screen. Conclusion: If you really have to be below $10 for blue blocking glasses, go ahead and purchase them. They block more blue light than any of the other three brands I have tried, which are Shileded, Beison and Gunnar Optiks. You won't get a headache from blue light when you are wearing these unless you are in the unlikely position of being more sensitive to light and prone to migraines as I am. Personally, I recommend you spend a few extra bucks and look for another brand. When the lens broke, I took a butane lighter and melted the crack together. It held for a few days, maybe a couple weeks, but eventually it gave out. Soon after, the earpiece went missing and now they are surely in the city dump.",

This seems to be a scientifically based fact. While ideally I would completely stop looking at a screen at night, these are my go-to when I can't resist. I read that these shades block a very high percentage of blue light. Pros: they block a large amount of blue light. They are substantially less expensive than competing fashion frames that block a fraction of the blue light. Cons: Not office-attractive, but I only wear them at home. Only good for reading or other black and white work; designers up all night working who need full color and no distortion can't use any yellow lens, especially such intense ones as these. In sum, if you can't break your reading on-scren at night habit, these should help reduce the insomnia that can result.",

After LASIK I decided to try out some glasses that block UV for work, since I no longer need my prescription lenses which had that protection. 1. They are chunky, but adjustable unless you have a tiny head like mine, in which case the ability to rotate them is more important than the ability to lengthen the arms. 2. The nose piece holds them well, but someone with a slight, never-broken nose might consider additional pads. 3. It blocks blue light. Our phone lights are blue plastic over white bulbs, and they look unlit with these on. 4. Greens look amazing, but if you need color differentiation visually, you'll either have to learn how the new colors look or go a less full route. 5. Normally looking at a computer screen leaves an after image when I close my eyes, or sometimes with them open. With these glasses there is either no after image or it fades in 1-2 seconds. 6. The design also blocks my desk fans from drying out my eyes, which is a nice bonus. Overall I have found this pair to block the most long blue light (visually, not as measured with a specific tool), and the reduction in after-images is a pleasant surprise. I don't need reading glasses yet, and I'm hoping to prolong indefinitely the time until I do.",

When I used the online blue light blocking test (where you compare two different color patterns) it seems to block out most of the blue light. So kudos from the blue light blocking perspective. It does change the colors pretty dramatically when you first put them on, but your eyes will adjust slightly and the picture (on your tv, etc) will look more acceptable over time (but of course, will not be nearly as good when watching without these!). The lenses are cheap plastic, but what do you expect for under $10? My primary issue is that these are huge and do not fit my face well. I have a low nose bridge and high cheekbones, so these sit on my cheekbones. As such these are not as comfortable as glasses that rest on my nose bridge, and I can see the bridge on the glasses when wearing them. Because of the poor fit, I tried another pair of \"computer glasses\" on Amazon. Although the other glasses had a slight yellow tint, when I tried the online test it appeared to not block much of the blue light so I returned them. If anyone has a recommendation on another brand of glasses that blocks most of the blue light please let me know! I may try the other UVEX glasses (S0360X) but my guess is these will not fit my face very well either.",

I've even had middle of the night times when I couldn't sleep and these do the trick. My only caution is I wear wire-framed glasses and the curve on these can bend the frames a bit changing their focus. As a result I wear the Uvex glasses without my prescription glasses which means I miss most things printed on the t.v. screen, but the way this helps me at bedtime is worth it.

However, I've got to leave the review at one star because we simply can't use them.

Put a pair on for 5 minutes and watch tv, stare at your phone, or work on your laptop, and if you slip them off you'll be amazed at how blinding that light suddenly feels. We just don't notice it because our eyes adjust. The Uvex glasses demonstrate just how bright it actually is. I purchased these because they appear to block more blue light than the other available options. While many competing products on here claim to block blue light, they ultimately have come up short in tests done by reviewers. These didn't. However, while the competitors may not effectively block blue light, at least they look somewhat normal. These look ridiculous. They are obviously designed as safety goggles for working with power tools and have been repurposed to satisfy the blue light crazed crowd. And that's fine with me, because they do the job well. But the idea of wearing these out of the house or at my job (which does not require any power tool beyond a computer) is laughable. My girlfriend still giggles every time I put them on, and, frankly, I don't blame her and thank her every time for not immediately leaving me. But, if you can get around all of that, for the price of these they really do seem to give your eyes a break. So put them on 30 minutes before you go to bed and let the scientists worry about whether it actually does anything to your melatonin production or not. It won't matter, because you'll definitely feel better.",

Blue light is on the lower spectrum of visible light, not quite in the UV (UltraViolet) but close. Please correct me if I'm wrong; being visible light, true blue light blocking lenses would leave you seeing a black or dark grey where the blue light should be. This is a bit of a problem surfing the web as the links to other websites, normally blue, would be grey or black & be difficult to easily recognize without hovering the mouse over the link. From my research, these are not blue light blocking glasses. Every piece of blue on a computer screen, on an electronic led light, on a pair of bluejeans in the sunlight comes through these glasses as blue. The purpose for two stars is the disappointment in the advertising name of \"Uvex Skyper Blue Light Blocking Computer glasses\" when these are clearly not blue light blocking glasses. My intention was to purchase blue light blocking glasses. However, I do give them two stars because first, they are Uvex which means quality & secondly, they can still be used as a decent pair of safety glasses when trimming trees & shrubs, cutting lumber, etc.",

My eyes feel more \"rested\" and less eyestrain when sitting in the dark and/or with minimal soft lighting. The ear pieces are adjustable, and if it weren't for the \"push\" effect annoyance, it would be a 5 star rating. Definitely would purchase again to aid in falling asleep when I get overstimulated by computer and/or television light. I need glasses to prevent some \"blurriness\" while I'm wearing these, and my thin wire frame prescription glasses fit well enough with these on, but usually I'm not wearing them because the point is to not end up staying awake hours past my bedtime.

They are adjustable, but I was afraid I was going to break them in the process. They don't fit over my prescription glasses, which isn't a big deal because I'm nearsighted. However, if you are far sighted this could be a problem for you. TOO DARK: Perhaps they block blue light but so do my eyelids. I feel I'm wearing sunglasses in the house. The color is too dark and very distracting. I can't imagine editing photos with these on or doing anything else where color is important. BOTTOM LINE: I wish I could return these but I've already thrown away the packing. I offered them to my husband but even he didn't want them and made a joke about me looking like a welder. :) I guess my kids will get them for play glasses.",

However, there are two flaws that I noticed and buyer should look out for: 1. The caddy's sheets of metal are not welded together, instead solder at both ends of the conjoining sheets. I have no fear of the caddy falling apart one day, but it's poor craftsmanship and attention to details that cause the product to lose value. 2. For detail-oriented individual, because the caddy's sheets of metal are solder, the walls are aligned 100% neatly next to each other. I have 2 of caddies (because one came without a tray and I had to get a free replacement) and one of them have a gap in the back of the caddy because the sheets of metal aren't aligned properly. Overall, I still recommend on buying this product. For the price-to-quality ratio, this product is best on the market as of right now. You honestly can't go wrong with this product. Buy it!

In the end the missing drawer doesn't detract from what I personally need for the supply caddy. Else I would have requested a replacement. I've filled it with: sharpies, highlighters, signo pens and sakura micron pens (each with a rounded corner) and post-its in the remaining drawer and some stylus.

I could not see a way to adjust the marginal space at the start and end of printing. I don't want white tails off my labels, so I just cut them off. This means I am wasting a lot of label tape that I don't need to - and other models I have used at work allow you to reduce the margin space. I think this machine was designed to have too much margin in order to run out of label tape faster and have to buy more sooner. Overall, I bought this on amazon for under $20 - what great price compared to what I saw others pay! So for that reason alone, I am ok having to cut some tails off.",

The reason I'm deducting stars is that I had to repair the battery, which seems like a common issue with this product, based on the other reviews that I've read. I used it for about a year, then packed it away for another year. When I took it out of storage, I got a low battery error when trying print, even after letting the battery charge for hours. I removed the battery pack from the printer, and split the case halves apart with a utility knife. There are two 14430 (4/5AA) LiIon cells inside. With a hobby battery charger, I attempted to discharge and charge the battery cells. They were completely dead. I purchased replacement cells here on Amazon, (http://a.co/9VkSnFR) and soldered everything back together. The printer's working great again, but unless you're good at soldering and enjoy tinkering, be aware that you'll probably have to buy a new battery pack, or repair the pack at some point. This product only has two stars on Dymo's website, and almost all of the negative reviews have to do with the battery.",

It can print multiple lines of text (not sure if it can do more than 2 as I have not tried) which was a feature I definitely needed. The reason I finally purchased this label maker is that I was replacing my breaker panel and wanted to label all of the new breakers. There is unlimited potential for labeling things and each day I think of something new to label. It's also great for pranks! One morning I labeled all of our cabinet doors and was sure to purposely place the labels in a different spot on each door this maximized my wife's annoyance and have me a great laugh as I acted like the labels were a great idea and not tacky at all!",

My review is for the DYMO LabelManager 160 Handheld Label Maker. I was looking for a basic label maker for an electronics project I\u2019m working on mainly, and anything around the house where a label would be helpful. I paid a little more than I wanted to, but I figured I would buy it, use it for my project, then sell it. It\u2019s kind of like renting a brand new device and then getting most of my money back. Anyway, it arrived quickly, I was pleased with the size and layout of the keyboard, and it was easy to begin using it. After inserting the blank roll of label tape I tried my first test label. The first label did not come out because it snagged inside label pathway. I saw it as my mistake for not threading the cartridge correctly on my first attempt. It really wasn\u2019t complicated at all, just one of those little things that happened because I had never used it before. Opening the back again I was able to quickly fix the threading problem and start creating labels. I was now able to quickly type and print labels with ease, and no more jams. I like that the current label does not automatically get deleted after it prints. Sometimes I needed the same label like \u201cOn - Off\u201d for several switches on my project board. Once the first label printed I pressed the cut icon then immediately pressed print again without having to retype. I\u2019ve found in life you can pick apart pretty much anything, but I don\u2019t feel this product is one of them. For the price I paid and the capability that it gives me I\u2019m pleased with the LM 160.",

It prints cleanly and the device is pretty intuitive, though if you're struggling you can find the manual at the Dymo website. Batteries are not included nor is the compatible ac adapter. It does however come with a sample roll of tape. All the labels in the photo, give or take a few practice labels and typos, were printed using the sample roll!",

I bought this Dymo economy unit for occasional home use. It\u2019s great that it doesn\u2019t waste much tape. My only disappointment is that it comes with a caps lock button but no shift button. I consider myself part of the tech-savvy generation, who by default types quickly and professionally, and no Shift button is just an annoying handicap that clumsifies and slows down my label making experience. I guess that wouldn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re one of those people who always type in ALL-CAPS. Also, it seems about 10% of buyers (myself included) receive defective units where the drive motor won\u2019t turn the tape spool. Before you return it, there\u2019s a trick. If the unit sits on the shelf for years before getting sold, the motor bearings apparently seize up. All you have to do is remove the tape cartridge and unseize the motor by turning it a bit with your fingers. You will hear a mild pop sound and feel when the motor is unseized. My printer has been fine ever since.",

The adhesive feature is really nice and it doesn't stick to wood to the point where it won't come off; I can pull the labels off if need be, but they don't come off by themselves. I've only ever used this brand of label makers. My mom has an older model (about a decade old) and it still works. No longer missing anything, as these labels really helped and I don't have any problems with this model. Highly recommend, especially for work use.",

I was able to configure the wireless setting and get the device on my network but then after downloading the desktop application I could never print to the printer via wireless. I would get the error message \"printer not responding\". I contacted DYMO support via live chat and had a broken English conversation with a tech how was useless at trouble shooting. She was asking questions like \"is the power turned on?\". Duh. Anyway, I was able to print one label with the printer hooked up locally after downloading the latest rev of their desktop app but never via wireless and I spent way to much time trying. I have had good luck with Brother printers in the past and I see they make a wireless label printer so I will give it a try.

I think their customer service plays relaxing spa music so you wont go bananas on them. This has been the WORST product I have purchased online. If I had my timeframe to return I would have done it along time ago. It is my fault that I waited too long to return. Just so all reviewers know... I have a MacBook Air, I have the latest software, and guess what... the concept of \"PLUG and PLAY\" is a darn joke. This has been more like PLUG and THROW AWAY!!!!!!! **** Update: I have contacted DYMO customer service again and have found out the battery was not in the battery compartment, which means it will not work. I assumed with the light turning on it was getting power. Unfortunately this was a packaging error and incomplete project causing me so much wasted time. The man helping me did figure out the problem and although at times condescending in tone was overall helpful, which was obviously the goal. He also is sending me a battery at no charge as it is in warranty. This was nice of him. Stay tuned for change in star rating or not.",

And then I labeled the garage parts/hardware drawer organizer. And then the repurposed plastic spray bottles full of distilled water, bleach mixes, cleaners, etc. Limitless opportunities!! A little tape seems to go a long way, but I bought a 25 foot refill just in case. It takes a little playing around to decide which font sizes work well for what purposes, but it's an easy device to figure out. Two special requests for their product developers: Please put common symbols right on the keyboard so we don't have to scroll through a menu to find dashes, slashes and ampersands. And please provide a single button that wipes out all the text when we create a new label. It's a pain to only have the backspace button to do the job (prospective purchaser please note that when you turn the label maker on, it will come up with the text of the last label you made, not a new clean slate). Otherwise, a very fun and potentially obsessive toy for home and office organization.",

It was hard getting the spacing because the display on the label maker does not show you the actual size of the characters. When printing two lines of text if you line up the top and bottom rows on the display then they do not print out lined up on the label. When printing two line labels the font would change to a smaller font. The largest font size that I could use for a two line label was 12 point. 2 lines of 12 point only uses about 2/3 of the width of the label. I have been looking for some 1/4\" black label tape but cannot find it anywhere. It has a proprietary battery which according to another review costs as much as the label maker. It does not work on the charger without a battery. It did not come with a driver for Linux. Did get the job done eventually but I wasted a lot of label in the process.",

This is the first rechargeable label maker I've owned. Instead of using AA batteries that are dead every time you need it, it has built in battery that lasts a good long time (months depending on use). Another reason I picked it up specifically was so I can get generic branded labels for much cheaper than typical label makers sell their tape for. I really like the fact it has built in memory. I have some labels (please return this book to... for example) which makes it easy to reprint more labels each month (or week).",

I don't know what all those positive reviews are for unless none of the users have ever used a Brother label maker before. 4 lines of text on 3/4\" tape was blotchy, faint, and hard to read. Customer service was horrible, supposed to open online chat at 9 am (EST), didn't open till after 10 am, but no one was actually taking texts. Save yourself some heartache and get a cheaper PT-D600 by Brother. By the time customer service was answering chat, I had processed the return, made it to Office Depot, and back to the office. They said the tape may have been old...the product was brand new in the box from Amazon...I have TZ tape that is over 10 years old and it still prints just fine. What is Brother doing to their tapes to make them last so long that Dymo is not doing? Also, the Dymo 420P does not allow for text going across from left to right in Portrait View...only down the label. I guess Dymo also does not care about customer service or any sort of feedback as they just ended the chat when I tried to give them some usable feedback about their product. Oh, and the 420P won't work without a battery in place. Good luck to Dymo owners.",

I've had them both for a few months and I dont know where the DYMO instructions are, so if there are other font types, I couldn't find them easily.

My usual means of buying stuff here is to read the reviews and see what people say. I also consider the number of 4/5 star reviews, the more of them often indicating a product excels in quality and performance. With that in mind I bought this DYMO label maker. I used it once and it worked fine. I removed the batteries because I didnt know when it would be used again. To my surprise it was needed a few days later so in goes the batteries and I tried to print.It sputtered and gave an error message \" TAPE JAM \" . I opened the back and removed tape to examine it and the feed area. All looked good so I fed a little of tape out and replaced properly and tried agin. I got the same thing.I then opened a new tape and repeated the whole procedure to no avail. Then I began to watch youtube videos to see what could be wrong. I found one where a guy described my same issues and gave a fix of turning the drive shaft clock wise five times with your hand and activating the on switch. I tired that, replaced the tape , fed it through with extra tape on the end and still the same error message. At that point I sent it back and bought a Brother. Maybe I got a dud? Maybe I got the one out of many that was doomed to fail but I gave up on it. Thanks to Amazon for taking it back and even having U.P.S. pick it up.",

Mind you this unit was taken very good care of as it had a permanent spot on my desk, and only used 1 tape of labels in that time.Very versatile, Offers complete customization to your labels through the included software. Would have been better if they made it connect and charge through a USB so that I don't have to connect to the printer port and also have an electrical outlet all clogged up. QUERTY keyboard makes for super fast label making. However, my unit never worked on just the rechargeable battery for on the go labels. It always had to be plugged in. KInd of pointless if you ask me... or maybe I got a defective unit. I will be calling customer support to see what solutions they offer, as I really am not thrilled to go with a different labeler as I ordered a 4 pack of the label tape for my supply closet so I could do a large re-filing project. SO overall... Great 4* Product, but sadly, this product MYSTERIOUSLY STOPPED WORKING...",

                "review_text": "UPDATE: Lowering to 4 stars due to poor Mac support. This label maker sucks on Mac, the light software would not work at all on Mac. The downloaded software had to be 8.5.2, and it still stopped working, and full re-install didn't get it going. Below are instructions to help delete the proper files, but I quit on the 3rd time it quit... I'm not re-installing software everytime I use the label maker. Possible driver conflicts. They got four hours of my life, and I'm not going to use terminal to troubleshoot their driver or conflict issues or whatever is happening - ( bad Mac support Dymo). I run a late 2012 MacMini on High Sierra, and it's up to date as of 2/3/18, upgraded, and it's a very dependable Mac. (Possibly interfering with my network HP printer drivers?) ANYWAY: On windows 10, the light software could work, but I still had to download v8.7 from Dymo to change fonts. So far it plays nice with Windows, and I will update if that is not the case in the near future... MAC NOTES: Enter the following review and use it if you like to play with Mac and figure stuff out, but I decided to grab my dusty miniPC from storage and print my labels from Windows. GOOD LUCK.... This is a simple black and white printer for making labels. The ease of use is very good. With my Mac, I had to download the software from the internet to make it work properly. As such, it was slightly more work than promised. After inserting the included battery, and roll of tape, plugging in the USB and power adapter, the unit powered on and the software came up - see your instructions. On a Mac, the included software popped up but wouldn't let me click inside the label to edit my label, make a new label, or print. The upper right icon in the light software CAN be clicked to download newest version software... then on Mac, you drag and drop to Applications and wait for it to install - took 5-10 minutes for mine... then, you can change fonts and sizes and print labels. Finally, after going through these software issues, I do have a small profile label maker at a price I can handle. Kudos to Dymo for reaching out to the non-OCD people who don't want to spend too much on labels we don't make very often. Check the different options for label tape on Amazon or the Dymo website. You can find more options there to go with your purchase. Reasonable and effective solution to orgazining my electronics so I know where all my cables and things are.",

The cons being that it takes 6 AAA batteries , sometimes prints with another black part from the ink that you have to throw out and the cut isn\u2019t always perfect.

As far as the machine itself, simple, simple, simple to use and produces really nice labels. I didn't even know when I bought it that it could print 2 lines as well as a single (larger font) line. For $20... just buy it! In addition to a very smooth operation, the unit itself has a very solid feel to it. It comes with a modest 10' roll of tape, I've been able to print quite a few labels with this and I just ordered 2 of the 23' replacement cartridges. Overall really nice job DYMO, this is a heck of a good value!",

It just plugs into a powered USB port on a computer, which recharges its battery. It does, as most label makers, cut off quite a bit of unprinted tape, but no more than any other label maker I've used. Since it has to be plugged into a computer, it's not as portable as the handheld Dymo that I had previously, but once the software is opened on my computer, it's much easier to make labels using my keyboard than the keyboard on a handheld label maker. The software lets you insert text, an automatic updating counter, a few simple shapes and lines, barcodes, auto-updating date and time, circular text, and addresses from an address book (mine came with a dozen addresses -- maybe someone pre-owned my label maker??). You can also import your own graphics. Great choices -- the only problem is, I'm using the supplied 1/2 tape, so there's not much room. I uploaded and added a photo go a label, but it's very tiny. Still, useful software, mostly for borders and a good selection of fonts, sizes, and colors. Much more versatile than the hand-held label maker I'd been using. I experimented for quite a while and haven't yet used up the sample tape supplied, but I did purchase three extra, full-sized rolls -- black on white, black on clear, and white on clear. I thought of purchasing a wireless version, but there were too many problems cited in reviews. Happy, for now, with this purchase.",

I already own a Brother brand labeler myself and bought this for a friend for Christmas. I was anxious to compare the two. Here's the skinny on this Dymo: - Cheaper than brother (both the unit itself and the tape cartridges) - Intuitive and easy to use - Love the QWERTY keyboard - Love that it has different outline, underline, text size and style options - LOVE that it doesn't waste NEARLY as much tape on the sides as my Brother model does (which can't be changed in settings). This is one of the major selling points for Dymo over Brother in my opinion. The tape cartirdges aren't cheap and when so much tape is wasted on either side of your text (which I usually just end up clipping off anyway) that really adds up! Hooray Dymo! The only thing that is lame about this particular model is that it only comes with ONE FONT. While the description is technically correct, I will say that it mislead me to believe that I would be getting multiple fonts when it told me there were 6 font styles. I have no idea what they think the difference is between 'font style' and 'text style' but to me a 'font style' is simply a different font and a 'text style' is referring to bold, italics etc. This feels very misleading and confusing and I am disappointed that there is only one font. Even 2 or 3 to choose from would be nice. That's where my Brother wins out. But that's the only area. Everything else about this labeler is fantastic! If I had to buy a new one for myself, I'd buy this one over the Brother in a heart beat. Hope this helps!",

I've been having some issues with third party tape cartridges printing too lightly the first few times after inserting a new cartridge, but I'm not sure that is a problem with the LabelManager PNP. Truthfully, I really wanted the LabelManager Wireless PNP instead, just for the 300dpi instead of just 180dpi for this model, but I could not justify the jump up in price. There are complaints that it will only work if the rechargeable battery has enough power, even when plugged into USB, causing issues if the battery dies. I have not run into this issue yet.",

They helped me re-set it (remove batteries, remove tape, press the on button 20 times, reinsert batteries and tape--this did the trick) and I hope it's a one-time event. Shout-out to good customer service. This machine does a great job making labels. It's exactly what I wanted. It's performance far outweighs the other little observations I have. The screen is not lighted, so be sure to work in good light. Keys are smallish, but bigger keys would make a bigger machine, and this one is a good size as is. Power cord is inexpensive ($9-ish) but shipping is just as much, making the cord cost almost as much as the machine. Fonts--there are \"font styles\" such as bold, italic, etc. but no different fonts. It's a plain sans-serif which is fine. Lots of clip art, of no interest to me. Font sizes is a helpful.",

Very handy! There are lots of tape color options and sizes that pair along with this product to boot. The QWERTY keyboard is another plus. Note that it does NOT come with batteries, but AAA batteries aren't too hard to find. Highly recommend if this is your first label maker and if you only need it for personal use.",

You can take the battery our after use EVERY TIME but, who needs that The problem with this unit is that the engineering on this unit is very poor. Does not completely turn off when you hit the OFF button. It still has a constant drain of power. It will be dead in 24 hours. So unless you want to get a new battery every 6 months or remove the battery after every use don't bother with this Piece of Crap! I have since done some measuring of the battery problem with this unit. With the unit OFF it still has a drain of 22.5 mA which means that a 1400 mAH will last about 2.5 days in perfect world. I have found it to be much shorter than that.",

However it is thick and sturdy, and actually perfect. I think the pictures are wonderful. The book is so stable it sits on the bookshelf without a bookend. Whoever criticized the pictures must be super picky. I guess if I Were a crystal expert and wanted super big clear detailed extraordinary pictures I could theoretically be disappointed.

I have always been fascinated with stones, and after looking through this book, I can see why I was drawn to a few of them in particular. The pages are well organized and in full-color, which helps when trying to identify a particular stone you are looking for. The index is where I spend most of my time, as it breaks down the ailment you wish to correct, and then directs you to the stone (or stones) that can help. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking for an easy to use reference book on healing stones. And by the way, it is the perfect size to travel with!",

The next day I was having company and I prepared a standing rib roast. It called for a cooking temp of 500 degrees for 40 minutes and then shut off the oven for two hours and don't open the door. After the two hour cook time with the oven off I pull out a gorgeous prime rib cooked perfectly and delicious. The pan however had turned a copper color and when I washed and cleaned it the stainless had flaked off the aluminum in the bottom of the pan. There was no cleaning the pan back to anything that looked like silver or clean. The rack, which got the low scores on the review, did however come through beautifully and cleaned up like brand new. For the investment, I would rather have put another few bucks on it and got one that could handle more than one roast before looking 40 years old and like it had been used over a camp fire. Since the rack will most likely be employed with each roasting, I guess the stainless flaking off the aluminum core wont hurt anything but it still sucks that you pay good money for a quality name like Cuisinart and come out with a total turd like this. Unless you are roasting a couple of Cornish hens or slow roasting at low temps, stay away from this junk. My moms 60 year old blue speckled roaster is still the best one I own.",

Obviously its not non stick so if you cook too high you can burn your food, however once we got used to them they cook great. Heat is evenly distributed and clean really nicely. Only negative, and its not really a problem with them, is that with our cooking we found we need an extra saucepan, as there is a small one, a medium, and a big pot. Would have liked another saucepan a bit larger than the medium included and maybe a very small one for sauces/ gravies, then it would have been perfect. But thats just me nit picking, it is not the best most perfect set out there, but if you want a good quality, and nice to use set, than this is probably one of the best value for money sets you can buy.",

If you use them as other reviewers have suggested, you will not miss your non-stick pans. I almost did not buy these. I have had a very unhappy experience with Cuisinart's customer (Orbital Mixer) But these are pots and pans, so I figured I was not likely to have to deal with Cuisinart's customer service. Though I do not have experience with All-Clad, they seem to have a good reputation for good customer service. Plus they are made in the U.S. (A big plus IMHO) The Cuisinart cookware is made in France (not China), and cost about one third what the All Clad set costs. Bottom line: If price is a priority for you, I don't think you can go wrong with these. If not, consider the All-Clad.",

I decided now that I'm a young professional in a double income house with two kids, we needed to step it up and get some nice cookware and have more dinners at home. I have been searching high and low for a nice cookware set (bonus if it had a steamer). I considered the Calphalon 10pc Signature set, the All-Clad 7pc Tri-ply set, and this set. I read reviews from numerous sites, watch countless Youtube videos, and decided to take a gamble on the Cuisinart Multiclad set. Boy, am I glad I did! First of all, this cookware set feels even more comfortable in my petite hands. It's sturdy, has some solid weight to it, and looks beautiful. But how does it cook and clean? Just as great as you can imagine. I learned a great deal on how to cook using stainless steel prior to getting this cookware set and I used my knowledge to the test and the food came out wonderfully. The finish is really beautiful. I hope it continues to look as beautiful as the years go by with proper wash and care. If you are on the fence about this cookware set, I say get it. It's a great cookware for a phenomenal price. And it is much more comfortable than the All-Clad cookware. I'm 4'11 and 120lbs so I'm not that big of a person. I felt the handle on the All-Clad seemed much longer.",

After the first pan was so warped after two cooking session that I had to rock it back and forth on the stovetop for it to heat both hemispheres, I ordered a replacement and specifically laid out the replacement on my stovetop to verify that it lay flat and did not spin. I then cooked two slices of bacon, allowing the pan to preheat on medium and then reducing the heat. As soon as the heat got up to medium temperatures, the pan spun easily and rocked back and forth on the stovetop. After allowing it to cool and cleaning it with warm water, it is now permanently unstable on a flat surface. So even armed with the knowledge that warping is a potential issue and carefully adhering to Cuisinart\u2019s suggestions to avoid said warping, I am still left with an unstable $60 pan.

That was enough of a convex surface to prevent the necessary total contact with the stove. I used SoftScrub and paper towel to clean it (and its gloss was even greater than when new), returned it for a replacement, delivered the replacement to my daughter, and a week later she called to report the same problem. I cleaned the second skillet, returned same to the local retailer, and purchased a more expensive, German skillet that is also clad and, most importantly for use on an induction stove, has an absolutely flat disc on the bottom. It works perfectly and my daughter smiles. Obvious lesson; unexcelled for both quality and price, but only for use on an electric or gas stove.",

So, during this awful co-dependent relationship with my kitchen, my pots and pans began to die one by one (they were horrible to began with). The smartest decision I made was to research about decent stainless steel equipment and deciding on these. I enjoy cooking now. It's not something I'll ever be passionate about, but I can live with cooking everyday as long as I have these pots and pans. They look sleek, neat, and reliable--and they are. The food cooks as it should. Great even heat distribution, so no unevenly cooked dishes. Half the oatmeal doesn't stick to the sides. I've even successfully cooked rice on the stove with these pots. Cleaning is extremely easy. Fried eggs don't need to be dosed in oil and painfully scrapped off at the end of the day. And if anything sticks too hard, simply boil some vinegar and scrub lightly. And the rims are beautiful for pouring liquids out of. Form, function, and price point are all excellent. This is what I call quality engineering.",

The only time food stuck was when my boyfriend used the frying pan and had the heat too high (he didn't realize how well these conduct heat, for a gas range I don't need it any higher than medium low and he was using medium high). If you have issues with sticking be sure to let the pan heat up before adding any oil or food to it, but don't have the heat too high because a: you will burn your food and b: it will stick. Cleaning has really been a cinch. After cooking in it, let the pan cool down a bit, put some hot water and deglaze the bottom of the pan. I like to just use the utensil i cooked with (not metal) and scrape around the bottom of the pan with the water in it. Within seconds the bottom of the pan is clean of food and the pan just needs to be scrubbed and put away. I do not have a dishwasher so I wash all of these by hand and the people complaining about difficulty cleaning these are ridiculous. In terms of residue on the bottom of the pans that won't come off with soap and water - these are stainless steel. That happens from time to time. I have a stainless steel work top that also gets the same type of residue. It is easy to get off with some vinegar and baking soda, or bartenders friend.",

I really want to like this pan. It feels heavy. It cleans nicely. It is a great size. I love that the lid that came with the deep saute can be used on this pan as well.

No, of course not, but then again, they\u2019re a fraction of the cost.

                "review_text": "I cook for a larger crowd regularly, and I had come to the point of needing a few extra pieces to complement my All-Clad d5 set. However, I was not prepared to pay All-Clad prices a second time round... so I decided to go for this set, which was less for the set than the All-Clad stockpot alone. To be honest, I only realized that there was a 7 piece set after receiving this one, and maybe that was lucky, as I would have ordered the smaller set had I seen it before... but now I am happy to have the 12 set. So, comparing the two sets... - Yes, the All-Clad is better quality. Sturdier, heavier, easier to clean. But, the difference is small, and at this stage, I am not sure it's $600 better. - Once you learn how to cook with stainless steel, both sets perform beautifully. For everyday cooking, I am not seeing much difference between the two. - The Cuisinart one still cleans nicely, even though it might take a bit more soaking for burned-on food. It reacts very nicely to Bar Keeper's friend for more difficult stains. - The shiny inside surface makes me nervous for scratches, but no evidence of such yet. I am sure they will eventually appear, but, honestly, I don't care as much. - The lids are much lighter than the All-Clad ones. Not sure that it matters though. - Compared to my other set, this one seems to have less surface and more height, making it more appropriate if I am cooking smaller quantities - I find myself reaching for it if I am cooking for 1 or 2 people. - It's beautiful. Happy to see it hanging on my rack. The different sizes are the main reason I am happy I ended up buying the 12 piece set, as it gives me more flexibility in choosing the appropriate size for the job at hand. I would think that the Cuisinart version is possibly better than the All-Clad if you are routinely cooking for 1-2 people; the All-Clad may be better if cooking for 3-4. Not that either set couldn't handle any amount of people in that range. For myself, I see that I am reaching for what I thought was going to be my backup set more often than I thought I would. And, even though I can tell the All-Clad is better quality, the difference is not such that would impact my day-to-day cooking. Of course, longevity (my All-Clad set is close to 10 years old with no signs of wear) remains to be seen.",

I have been using it at least once a week and it cooks well and cleans up nicely - I let the pan cool, soak it, and haven't had to use Bon Ami too often to remove more stuck-on food. The multiclad construction allows the skillet to heat evenly and the food cooks evenly. The only issue I've encountered is due to the unevenness of the burners on my electric stove. I have to move the skillet around a bit on the cooking surface which tilts significantly, which is, of course, the fault of the stove top, not the skillet. There has been a marked improvement in the meals I've prepared using this skillet over the older, not terribly good pans it's replaced. The long handle is angled well, stays cool for handling, and makes it comfortable to maneuver the skillet during cooking and serving. The helper handle is a great and necessary addition for lifting and moving the pan. The lid is designed well and fits well. I'm pleased with the size, features, maintenance and functionality of this pan. Good price, good product. It's a joy to cook with it.",

We have the complete set with the external aluminum rings, and we know not to use high heat on those as well, so we were totally surprised and disappointed.

My well used copper bottom cookware was not working with this change and after investigating the efficiency and even heat cooking of the stainless steal Cuisinart, my search was over. I am very happy with this cookware's ability to quickly and evenly cook what ever I am cooking, and clean up is a breeze. You won't be disappointed with this product.",

This pan continues the tradtion, and in fact its lead has grown in my view. I bought the Calphalon Tri-Ply 10\" pan a few weeks before this one; I was disappointed at how cheap-feeling they have become -- the aluminum middle layer looks to be barely 1-1.5 mm thinck, and the pan weighs just 842g (29.7 oz) -- although it performs reasonably well. I needed a 2nd 10\" pan, as I'm eliminating non-stick entirely from my cookware collection, so I ordered this one from Amazon. The Cuisinart pan looks gorgeous, and feels as hefty as I would expect. It weighed in at 1,116g (39.37 oz), 33% heavier than the Calphalon! The aluminum layer looks to be more than twice as thick (looking at the outer edge, and the pan performs exactly as its Multiclad Pro siblings in my collection do -- perfectly. As with other pans in this line, including saucepans, the pouring lip is a welcome improvement over, say, the All-Clad pans with no lip. The handle is also easier on the hands when lifting the pan overhand (which I do because it's more natural for me, although it uses tennis-player muscles that a lot of people don't have). Overall, a great pan at a terrific price. I see no reason whatsoever to spend all that extra money for the \"big brands\". FYI, I've generall had no issues with quality control for these MCP pans. The one time I received one (a 6qt saucepan) with a bowed bottom, such that it wouldn't sit flat on a flat surface, it was promptly replaced, no questions asked.",

                "review_text": "This cookware set is well worth it. It has fully-clad structure just like All-Clad, but at a fraction of the price. I own other All-Clad pans and can safely say that the Cuisinart is at least 90% of All-Clad's performance. They heat evenly and cleans easily as long as you use them properly, also the selection in this set is great for a small household (2-3 people). I have to admit that the look is a little utilitarian, not as nice as All-Clad, but actually more functional since all pots and pans in this set have a rolled lip for drip-free pouring, while in All-Clad very few have it. As a side note, in some other reviews it was mentioned that the rivets are easily corroded which worried me a little before purchasing. However, I can happily say that it's not the case any more for the current batch/version. All rivets on the pan (except the steamer insert and all lids) are now stainless steel instead of aluminum -- I guess Cuisinart listened to the reviews and made the improvement. Overall a high-value cookware set that will last you years to come. Enjoy cooking!",

                "review_text": "I bought this set two months ago and have waited a bit to post a review to make sure I had a chance to live with it for a while. We had just purchased a new stove with true convection oven and ceramic radiant burner cooktop. On reading the manual, I found that most of my stovetop cookware was not recommended for use with this cooktop. My pots and skillets either had ridges on the bottom, painted surfaces, or both. Even the copper-bottom set I have had for 40 years was not recommended for use with high heat. Not willing to take a chance on ruining the cooktop, I decided to invest in a whole new set of cookware, and spent a lot of time online reading professional chef websites and anywhere else I could find reviews for the recommended products for my new stove. The Cuisinart Multi-clad Pro products consistently scored high. There are similar Cuisinart products that are stainless steel, but are not multi-clad. I made my final decision after reading an article dated March, 2017 on Best Cookware for Glass-top Stoves at a website called onthegas.org. This article gave their top five picks, and the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro set was at the top of the list. On receiving the cookware, I was impressed with the beautiful appearance and the weight of the cookware. It simply looks and feels like professional cookware. There are many products that cost more - much more. But I am cooking for my family, and considering the excellent warranty offered on this product, I felt it was a great buy for the price. It heats quickly and evenly. The helper handles remain cool, and it cleans up beautifully. Some reviewers have mentioned spotting on the inside surfaces, but this cleans up with a little vinegar, and even so, does not impair the functionality of the cookware. I gave away the cookware that was not recommended, except for the Revere Ware copper bottom set I received as a wedding gift in the 70's - it's okay to use as long as you don't use high heat. I have since purchased a couple of other pieces in this line and I am just as happy with them. I needed a shallow roasting pan to use with the convection roast/bake oven setting. I got the large lasagna pan with roasting rack. Since the Multiclad Pro set did not include a nonstick skillet, I ordered the 10-inch non-stick skillet. I plan to buy the tri-ply nonstick double griddle - not in the Multiclad line, but similar. This cookware is a joy to use. I have always considered myself a pretty great cook, but the results I am getting with my new stove and cookware have really upped my game and I am having fun trying new recipes and techniques.",

If you have trouble with your hands be aware that this cookware is a bit on the heavy side especially the larger pieces when full of food. Also if you are used to using cookware with clear lids this might be an adjustment for you, it was for me anyway but then I can't break these lids. Remember that the handles do get hot fast. I especially like the large deep skillet that comes with this. I have discovered that things don't stick if I spray the pan with a cooking spray like Pam first. Some folks have had no sticking problems so I'm guessing it's just me and my cook-top runs a bit hot. If you want to keep this looking brand new all the time get the Bar Keepers Friend and liquid cleaner and the cleaning cloth. Works beautifully.",

Also, best to keep a bit of Barkeepers Friend on hand. If you find that you get some bluing, just add a very small amount of vinegar to the pot/pan and it's instantly gone.

It has the tri-ply construction, stainless steel with aluminum core which also goes up the sides. The lesser expensive sets are only tri-ply on the bottom, which truly makes a huge difference in even and thorough heating and cooking. The set arrived and not only is it nice to look at, the cooking is phenomenal! When I read reviews that this cookware would make a difference in how food tastes, I did not believe it. So, game on! I made soup stock and it is the best stock I have ever made! When my boys commented on how great it was - I knew that the cookware does make a difference. I was hesitant to cook eggs because of some of the reviews saying that they stuck. If you follow some basic rules, the cookware performs outstandingly. The eggs were perfect and nothing (not even a smidgeon) stuck to the pan. Here are the key rules I am following with great success: 1. Never heat above a 5 on a 10 point scale for heat. (half of your top setting) I promise - you will be able to sear and brown and saute like a champ. 2. Heat the pot/pan BEFORE adding butter or oil. This is the key to not having anything stick to the cookware. (for eggs, I used butter - amazing results! I was going to buy a couple of non-stick pans for eggs but do not need to with these results) 3. I do NOT put mine in the D/W. I need to get some Barkeepers Friend for the few spots, but so far, they clean up beautifully. For those who have posted negative reviews or had bad outcomes, this cookware requires a change in cooking styles/methods and finesse to achieve successful results. I truly believe that if you follow the rules posted, you will be love this cookware! (As well as saving lots of money over All clad or other professional quality cookware.) Bon appetit !",

This cookware is lovely; it is nice and heavy and holds the heat very well. I loved the way the pots looked right out of the box! In addition, the skillet handles stay cool (but the lid handles do not). However, you must read the care and use instructions! A LOT LOT LOT of butter or oil is necessary to prevent the food from hopelessly sticking to the pan and this is my biggest complaint: clean-up can be a challenge if you want the cookware to look nice. Any little food sticking to the pan after cooking was a challenge to remove although soaking for a few minutes is helpful. I found that Bar Keepers Friend (with a soft sponge) works better than the recommended Bon Ami. The Bar Keepers Friend even works on greasy pots. Even if you are only cooking green beans in water, you might be tempted to simply rinse out the pot but it will not be clean enough. Also, dry the pots and lids right after washing otherwise there will be spots. That said, I still love the cookware and hope you will too!",

                "review_text": "I decided to wait for a while to write this review as I wanted to use them for at least a few weeks prior to rating and reviewing. Keep in mind this is my first set of stainless steel cookware I've ever used so I can't really compare them to other stainless steel sets. I've only used numerous types/styles of non-stick sets. Teflon, ceramic, \"green pan\", copper chef, etc. (I've never actually BOUGHT a set of cookware until I bought these, all of the others have been gifts of some sort). I was trying to decide between these or a set that Calphalon were heavily discounting at the time (a set with copper on the outside, stainless on the inside, aluminum core), but out of all the comparisons and other reviews, I chose these instead mainly because the copper would most likely tarnish and get unevenly ugly. Also America's Test Kitchen tested sauce pans. The winner being All-clad of course was WELL out of my price range. Their next recommendation though was the Cuisinart Multiclad unlimited, and I figured those should perform similar to these. Pros Stainless steel - with care will last a lifetime and more Heats very evenly and quickly The tapered rim really does make pouring MUCH easier and practically drip free (I always have a paper towel handy regardless) Cooked eggs without sticking (yeah, you read that right) Cooking is much more predictable Cons The cookware do \"stain\" but can be removed Must be very diligent with proper preheating and not overheating Parts of the cookware is a high mirror polish (more on why I put this as a con later) Could be sensitive to temperature shock (but then again, MOST if not all cookware is) First, I'll tackle the cons \"Stains\" can occur on the cooking surface, especially if you get some stuck food (some food sticking is normal, it's called fond, don't be discouraged by it). After giving it a good soap and water bath with a plastic scrub sponge I've noticed light colored \"whitish\" marks on the cookware. Honestly this isn't a problem, but it does trigger my OCD to want the pans to look clean. Nothing a little Bon Ami/Bar Keepers Friend can't fix. Just don't really recommend doing this often as these are minor abrasives. This leads me to... Mirror like finish in spots. I honestly wish all of the surface had the brushed look to it. Once you use Bon Ami/Bar Keepers friend on the upper parts of the cooking surface or elsewhere, you'll get swirl marks. This is just once again my OCD of wanting to keep my brand new set looking brand new. They WILL scratch and get swirls and other stuff. But the mirror finish only makes it that much worse. It obviously won't change the performance of the cookware. Preheating/overheating. These pans can heat up QUICK (ymmv depending on your stove type, mine is electric with exposed element), even on medium. Because of this you really need to make sure you aren't overheating the pan while preheating. Overheat can/will lead to badly stuck/burned food. This is going to be typical of pretty much any multiclad/all clad stainless steel cookware. If you don't like this, stick with hard anodized or something of the sort. Temperature shock. Honestly this should go without saying, but really the last thing you want to do is go from cooking to putting this under cold water. I've seen reviews (from pros using this specific cookware) where they have done this and the pan was fine. But really, you seriously run the risk of warping ANY cookware doing this. Just.....don't do it. Time for the pros Stainless steel - Really, there's not much to say here. Because the outer and inner surfaces are stainless steel, as long as you're not abusing the pans, they'll last forever. There isn't a non-stick surface that slowly turns turns into a reason for throwing it out. Heats evenly/quickly - The fact that these have an aluminum core sandwiched by stainless steel really helps these pans heat up quick and even. I've made frittata and numerous other things and get a pretty consistent cook throughout the entire thing (it would help if my stove top were more level but there's little I can do about that without replacing the entire top, the whole stove is level). Tapered rim - I've poured out sauces, soups bacon grease, etc. It all pours out really easy and smooth. I can't 100% comment on it being drip free as I always have a paper towel or something handy to wipe the edge. Force of habit. Cooked eggs without sticking - Yeah I've read numerous reviews saying that eggs stick like crazy to these. It's the one thing that made me wait 2 weeks prior to even think about cooking eggs, let alone over easy eggs on these. I can safely say that eggs swirl around on these pans just as good as any perfectly new non-stick pan. Granted you need to make sure you heat the pan just right and prep it. I haven't tried putting eggs in with JUST butter yet but I would imagine it would work. Usually I'll put a about an 1/8th of a teaspoon of canola oil in the pre heated pan and use a paper towel to cover the surface and the sides, let it sit for a few seconds, then put a little butter in the bottom. I have yet to have any eggs stick at all. In fact, I threw out my old 8\" non-stick I kept around specifically for eggs. Cooking predictable - Because the pans heat evenly and they're super conductive, cooking because so much more predictable and you use much less heat. On my old pans, I'd usually cook most things on medium high. I've found medium with these has been equivalent. Polenta, rice, etc all cook really nicely because you can just set the heat to low and just let it go. At first I was a bit worried about the lids not being see through (as I've always had glass lids) but now I've come to not care. All in all every single time I cook with this cookware, I always find myself saying \"I Love these pans!!!\". I have yet to have food \"stick\" to them. At least to the point where it's destroying the food. The only thing I haven't tried are fish and pancakes, but I would imagine pancakes would stick regardless. If you're having a problem with all your food sticking, you're doing it wrong. You're most likely over heating the pan. Watch some youtube vids about proper use of stainless steel cookware and you should be able to figure it out.",

I did have a little trouble getting the pan to give me textbook leidenfrost effect. This is the process to make sure your pan is fully preheated, and thus, fairly non stick. Now non stick in a stainless pan is not non stick in the way that Teflon, or ceramic would be non stick. Things can and may stick to the pans surface. But this surface is non stick in the way a well seasoned BBQ grill grate is non stick. When a properly preheated surface has brought protein to the proper temperature, the protein will release, and thus be non stick. However, bits of protein and fat may remain. These can easily be removed with a deglazing process. Deglazing is what makes this pan a Star. You can build amazing pan sauces, and gravies with this pan. I cooked breakfast sausage in the pan. The sausage released and cooked beautifully. I found most of the cooking surface to cook and brown the sausage fairly evenly. There was a small 10% zone area near the handle that browned more slowly. I assume the handle absorbed and radiated some of the heat from this area. You will see the variation in my sausage picture. It however, left nice little bits of protein and fat, for one of the nicest sausage gravies I\u2019ve made. Non stick Plastic pans will never build a gravy like this. Cast iron can, but is more difficult, because of the darkness of the pan. Stainless is much more forgiving with wet cooking like pan sauce, or gravy, than cast iron would be. Making clean up a snap, comparatively. I tried this pan after a seasoning process, with a high temp cooking oil, and I tried it unseasoned. I found it equally non stick either way. Though, if you use the leidenfrost test, preseasoned pans will not work. Well what is Leidenfrost effect, you ask? The Leidenfrost effect in this case is when a properly preheated pan will cause a drop of water to dance around the pan like a mercury ball. I was somewhat successful in this test at level six cooking on my Fridgidair inductive cook top. My water droplet was somewhat more flat than I would expect, but held together and danced a bit. When I preheated my pan, I gave it a few seconds on low, then turned it to level 3, for about a minute, then finally up to level 6. Induction cook tops raise the temp very quickly, this can warp a bonded pan. So for the love of Rachel Ray, dont set your induction cook top to high and fire this puppy up!! I\u2019ll restate here, my pan was rounded out of the box. I decided to test it out for a few days since I had it. I did not warp this pan. The pan is attractive enough to leave out, and the lid is very helpful in preheating, and melting, and reducing splatter.",

The pots polish up very nice with Bar Keeper's Friend, which effortlessly removes any discoloration that some reviewers have complained about. We use microfiber dishtowels to dry them and give them a final buffing. It is also important to use wooden utensils because they will scratch. Due to the great heat distribution it has never been necessary to use anything higher than medium high heat. After one year of use they still look and perform like new. Another nice feature is the pouring lip, which the French version of these pots didn't have. Nice, even, spill proof pouring every time. We are convinced that this will be the last pot set we will ever need, and that someone else will get plenty of use out of them after we are gone. 5 stars if they had cool lid handles.",

                "review_text": "Have tested this twice so far since I got it. Does exactly what I want it to do! Roasted a 3-pound chicken when I first got it, then a 12-ish pound turkey this week--all good. I didn't make gravy after roasting the chicken (why?? Must have forgotten) but I did after the turkey and OH HECK YES I was able to put this right across two (electric) stove burners and scrape those drippings up just fine. The chicken looked hilariously puny in this size of a pan--to be honest, so did the turkey, a bit--but that makes me confident that I can use it for a 20+ pound behemoth next Thanksgiving if I want. Other relevant thoughts: -I watched VERY CAREFULLY for the pitting issues some reviewers mentioned. Nothing so far! I haven't used anything acidic in it, just in case, but I will at some point and adjust this review if needed. There were, of course, fork marks from where I made gravy, but that happens to my mixing bowls too and has never escalated into an issue. Again, if it does, I'll update. -The rack doesn't quite look/feel as high quality as the pan, but so far has worked just fine. Either the rack or the pan itself is warped (gotta be the rack, or if not it's only a slight flaw and has yet to cause any issues)--it wobbles within the pan. :/ Annoying (and the reason this review is 4 stars instead of 5), but hasn't caused any half-cooked poultry to fling itself across my kitchen, so no worries. -Yes, it's dishwasher safe! I was worried about that. Ran it through on the top shelf because that's where it fit best, used the \"pots and pans\" setting with my usual detergent tab, and it came out fine. No clue yet how that will work out in the long term, over years or decades, but so far so good. The rack went on the bottom shelf and came out SPOTLESS, which was nice--part of why I got rid of my old pan/rack combo was because I was still scrubbing turkey schmutz out of that thing a week after Thanksgiving last year. -If you're used to smaller or lower quality pans, know that this is much heavier and that it may take a few uses to get accustomed to the size and angle of the handles. You'll probably be fine--I have moderate arthritis in my hands and was still able to move it easily--but take the weight into consideration for the first few uses. That being said, the handles are VERY useful--makes it easy to get a firm, secure grip. -I have no idea why, at the time I'm posting this, the Amazon price is showing up at $121. I paid $60-something a month or so ago. At the price I paid, this is a good investment in functionality and size. Any higher and I'd be a little dubious, but your mileage may vary (I'm coming from a lower middle class perspective here--if spending $100+ on a roasting pan is normal for you, go for it). You're unlikely to find it for much less than I paid, but if you do, jump on it. Good pan, worth getting.",

It takes a bit of skill to use chromed sets like these since you need to know how to cook things so they don't stick to the pan. Let me tell you, it is not worth it. 4 Months in and the discoloration is discouraging. The food naturally sticks to it one way or another. You need to keep a very watchful eye on your food or it will ruin the pan with burned grease almost impossible to tear off even with professional grease removal products. Save yourself some trouble and buy none stick sets and forget about chromed sets. This product is testing every bit of my patience every time I have to cook (3 times a day).",

A few points to keep in mind: These pans heat quickly and with less heat than cheaper pans. A setting of 6 (of 12) on my large burners will cause canola and olive oil to smoke. I now treat 6 as \"high\" heat. 5 works fine for searing meats. Follow the instructions. Heat the pan, then add oil. When the oil has heated up, add the food. Level your stove so oil will sit evenly in the pan. When the pans have cooled (touchable), I put in hot water with a squirt of dishwashing soap,and let it sit for a few minutes, then clean with the \"hard\" side of a no-scratch sponge. If anything is left, a bit of Bar Keeper's Friend cuts right through it in seconds and polishes the surface nicely. It's so easy, I never put them in the dishwasher. I have had some minor warping with the 12\" skillet and 5.5 qt saute pan, neither of which are included in this set. They still seem to cook well. No issue with the pots or smaller pans. I'm buying my son a Multi-Clad Unlimited 5.5 saute pan to test whether the 2-ply construction (stainless interior, aluminum exterior has the same minor warping issue or not.",

The pan warped after first use: I took it out of the package, cleaned it with mild detergent, heated it up on 4/9 on the glass cooktop, added oil to the pan once hot enough, added some chicken, and then noticed that it had already warped. I sent it in for a replacement, did the exact same steps with the replacement only with 3/9 heat and the pan had already warped after adding the oil. Warped pans do not work well on glass cooktops because of uneven heat distribution. This looks like a design mistake to me, and I expect the same thing to happen on the third pan, so avoid this if you are cooking on a glass cooktop. I did not encounter these problems with the 12\" saute pan or the 10\" skillet of the MCP-12N set. Very disappointing.",

Do not use high heat, and definitely don't let the pot dry out while on the stove. This will discolor the bottom. With multiclads, you don't need to blast the fire all the way up. I just use medium heat max, and it still heats up fast. This pot is dishwasher safe, but hand washing is still preferred to avoid damaging the surface over time. Overall, I like this product. I use it to make ramen, boil water, make small batches of stock, etc. It is well balanced and won't tip over to the side like some cheap pots tend to do. The handle is solid and doesn't wobble. The lid handle can get a bit hot so I just use a kitchen towel to lift it up. The handle is big enough anyway that having a glove on (or a towel) shouldn't be an issue. I like the product so much that I just leave it on the stove top. Along with my cast iron skillet, the pot has earned its permanent place as a daily workhorse. The price also isn't bad. Definitely worth the purchase.",

This set clearly has vastly superior thermal conductivity, and heats up approximately a billion times more quickly (potentially slightly exaggerated, but probably not much). Everything is also nice shiny stainless steel - looks and feels really high quality. The one unfortunate thing I have noticed is that the lids do get pretty warm - I definitely need to use an oven mitt to hold the lids if they've been on warm pots or pans for too long. I don't mind it since they do look really nice and I always have an oven mitt in reach anyways, but worth noting if that's a huge deal for you.",

Comes with the right amount of pans and pots for all of your normal every day needs. You do have to get used to cooking with these after using non-stick pans but the learning curve is quick.

We've owned cheap stainless pans that never stained. We bought a very expensive set of Le Creuset and it stains bad enough where you can't get it out by scrubbing with a plastic scouring pad. I called Le Creuset and they recommended Bar Keepers Friend, Funny how this pan doesn't need that to stay clean and the quality of the Cuisinart is just as good if not better. The handle on the Le Creuset is better but that's about it. Given the choice after owning both is that the Cuisinart is better to cook with and therefore the better choice. I'd like to mention that the Le Creuset enamaled cast iron dutch ovens are amazing, Just because I think their stainless stuff is the pits and Cuisinart blows it away, i recognize some of their offerings are top notch.",

                "review_text": "Before purchasing this set I had been using AllClad tri ply stainless, then AllClad copper core cookware for several years. This set cooks every bit as well as those did. Despite the fact that this set costs less than some of the individual knives I keep in the kitchen, I wouldn\u2019t trade them for much of anything. That said, here are my only critical comments: The 8\u201d omelet pan is nearly useless, it\u2019s really only well suited to a fried egg or two, and for that non stick or cast iron is a more suitable material. I replaced this with a non-stick for these tasks. The handles on the 6qt stock pot are a little thinner and less comfortable to hold when the pot is full than the AC version, which is more rounded/beveled. The metal lids are compact, durable, and light, but glass lids would be helpful at times. There are replacements that will fit of course, and I will be using them for a few of the pieces. The 2.5qt pot is too small to prepare many sides for even just two people in. For example if making mashed potatoes and steaming broccoli, you\u2019d have to use the 4qt and the 6qt stock pot (which is overkill for the task) as the 2.5qt couldn\u2019t handle either. At first I thought the steamer basket was silly, since I had one already and didn\u2019t feel the need for another. That said I find myself using the one included in the set and am very pleased with it. All in all, I think with a few specific additions (a non stick fry pan, a glass lid or two, and some supplemental pieces to fit your family size and cooking needs) this is unquestionably the most sensible cookware set available. At the time that we purchased these a kitchen store nearby was liquidating stock. Some AC pieces were on sale for 50-60% off. This was still a smarter buy and I\u2019m glad we got these instead. Other than the handles on the 6qt pot feeling thinner, there isn\u2019t a single thing that separates these from AC in the hand, or on the burner.",

I babied the replacement pan because I was concerned about the issue happening again. I never used it on high heat, warmed it up slowly, etc. Still, it warped. If you haven't had to deal with warped pans before, it's a huge pain. The pan spins and rocks on the stove while trying to use it, meaning you constantly have to hold onto it. I've had better luck in the past 20 years with cheap pans from Walmart or Target. I will be avoiding this brand in the future.

So far I've used the steamer, the large pot, the small pot, and the saut\u00e9 pan, making a variety of foods like custard, gravy, pasta, pasta sauce, veggies. I haven't had any problems. I did quite a bit of research about stainless steel before using them, though. Most people who write negative reviews clearly just have no idea how to cook with them and try using them like cheap nonstick pans. It seems like only a minority of reviewers actually received something defective. I feel like I shouldn't have to include the following information, but obviously it's necessary as people aren't doing the research themselves: The trick is to let the skillets or saut\u00e9 pan heat up completely, then add butter, swirl it around, then add whatever you're cooking. The food should not stick. Mine didn't. If you're boiling water, let the water come to a full boil before adding salt, otherwise the bottom of the pan could become pitted from the salt. Try not to use metal utensils as these will scratch the stainless steel. I use wooden and silicone utensils with mine. These are dishwasher safe, but if the pans are knocking around against other dishes, this could also lead to scratching. Some discoloration can occur from food sticking and burning (which, again, shouldn't happen if you're using the above method). Some can occur from chemicals in the water wherever you're living (you probably can't help that one, but it's still not the pan's fault). Some can occur on the bottom of the pan if you're using extra high heat (I've never had to go above a medium/medium-high heat setting). If plain old dish soap isn't cutting it, try bar keepers friend and a heavy duty sponge like Jetz-Scrubs, both available on Amazon. Yes, people, it requires some work, some effort. But so does good cooking. It requires some time and attention, and if you just want to cobble something together on the stove and walk away and leave it there, these probably are not for you. But if you want to take your cooking to the next level, then these are worth it. These feel like they'll last a long time, and from other reviewers it looks like they do. Take care of your pots and pans and you shouldn't have a problem.",

They'd only lasted about 7 years--the last few years often peeling and unfit to use. I use cooking spray on these stainless steel pans and they stick far less than my damaged Teflon coated pans. They heat up much faster than the pans I was used to, so take care. My daughter-in-law spent an exorbitant amount on All-Clad, and I like this Cuisinart set much better.

So, I have been using this product since March 2016 (that would be just about 2 years). I have a thyroid condition which I think is somewhat responsible for my hair thinning. I'm 52, so I'm also expecting to get some thinning just due to age, but I had started to see more hair loss that I liked. My thick ponytails were getting quite thin. I did some research and found this product. I have been taking it faithfully twice per day for the past two years. it took some time for me to see a difference but now I can honestly say that my hair feels much thicker than it has in years. Its still not quite as thick as when I was 20 years old, but there is absolutely no sign of thinning spots and it looks and feels very full when I touch it. I'm also noticing a lot of new hair growth, many little hairs growing all over my head. I noticed this more because almost at the same time I started taking this product I decided to grow out my bangs. Now that they are all gone I am noticing how many little hairs are wanting to replace my bags. Its actually very exciting to see all this growth. If you want immediate results then maybe this is not the product for you, but if you have a little time then go ahead and try it. I am happy that I did and I will continue to use it .",

Here is what I can tell you from experience. I found the directions not to be quite as straight forward as they should be. You have to follow the directions as stated from the beginning. Then decrease to one a day. And then continue forever. I have introduced it to a good number of clients. There are 2 is hasn\u2019t worked for. One client was determined and all of a sudden after 2 years a significant amount of hair popped out around the hairline. So it works you have to decide how much time your willing to invest. From what I\u2019ve seen give it at least a year. I myself stopped after some months and then realized it was working and went back on it. My clients have done the same. And it continues to work as long as you take it. I actually just use it a couple days per week now and won\u2019t stop. Even my co workers see the difference in my hair and refer their clients to it. You could spend your money on worse things bedsides getting better hair! Give it a try!",

My acupuncturist suggested taking Viviscal in conjunction with treatment from my dermatologist (I'm doing laser treatment with an excimer machine). After 1 month, I started growing some spots of hair. It's been over 6 months now and my eyebrows have grown back, my eyelashes are no longer falling out, and the hair on my scalp is starting to fill back in. I do believe it was a combination of the laser and the viviscal. The Viviscal kept my hair strong and expedited the growth process, while the laser targeted the antibodies from attacking the hair follicle. If you're just noticing some spots, I HIGHLY recommend this product. CON: Increased unwanted hair on chin and upper lip.",

He started balding and it reversed the process - and his hair looks great. 3 months of diligent use later, I am so relieved to say that my hair grew back and it's shinier and healthier than before. Better than I could have hoped for. Thank you Viviscal! I should add I tried Biotin and other hair supplements while I was searching for a remedy, and none of them worked for me. I was desperate and researching hair doctors in my area - I'm so glad I shared my struggle with my friend and he recommended this product!",

Other things I suggest are to take probiotics and enzymes, do not go on a super low carb diet but also eat enough healthy fat and PROTEIN. I believe a mix between the ketogenic diet and a plant based diet are the best ones for hair growth an d prevention of hair loss. These vitamins are crucial though and I love them.",

I thought at first it was due to stress from having the flu and missing some days at work. Two weeks in, even my husband commented that I was shedding more all over the house even after getting better. I thought it might be my body just getting used to these. I researched and found some women saying it affected them the same but it got better, so I continued the packet of pills. Three weeks in my hair was more brittle, dry and the ends were splitting. I went for a hair cut and my stylist commented on the change within a few months. I have been trying to grow my hair for the last year and been religiously taking care of it.

I had a friend in town whose hair looked incredible and she happened to be taking Viviscal for 3 years total and highly recommended it, so I read review after review and thought I would give it a try. - Now I have new hair growth along my edges where I never had hair grow before - I also have 3-4 inches of new hair growth that sprouts from the top of my head and makes me look like I got electrocuted if I don't hairspray it down. - I read a blind study where they say the results are most noticeable at 9 months - 1 year, but I will say that I noticed a sure difference within 2 months.

After buying a pack from this seller and noticing, after taking about half of the pills, that I was starting to lose more hair than usual, I just went out and bought a new pack from an authorized retailer. The pills look very different. Real Viviscal pills are twice as thick as these. Even the blister packs look different when you compare them side by side (though this FRAUDULENT seller has clearly worked hard to reproduce the lettering and embossed serial number). These FAKE PILLS also have a sweet smell, which real Viviscal pills definitely do not have. I have no idea what's in these pills and I'm throwing them out right away. They DEFINITELY DO NOT WORK as described and in fact, COULD BE TOXIC.",

However, it did not make my hair loss worse, so that was a plus. The vitamins in it are probably an added benefit. There is a lot of iron, but it wasn't enough to constipate me as iron tends to do. A hairdresser I trust recommended I take prenatal vitamins and biotin as a similar (and cheaper) supplementation. Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone suffering from androgenic alopecia and hoping to stop the hair fall. I would recommend this for someone willing to experiment with supplements to re-grow hair.",

It's to the point that I feel embarrassed about my hairline as it is thin and frizzy because the hairs are so short. On top of that, I just made the connection after reading other reviews that explains why I have gained 10lbs in 6 months despite dieting and exercising regularly. I have also noticed bloating and changes to my menstrual cycle that started shortly after beginning taking these pills, and now I'm extremely concerned about what I have been ingesting. I have wasted over $200 on these pills and I am not happy. Please don't make the same mistake I did.",

I wanted to try this product to grow thicker hair. After exactly 1 week I noticed my hair was falling when I took shower. It became worse each day, but I was still determined to finish the 1 month supply. I got horrible back acne and my face and scalp became oily. I did not change my diet and I am not on any kind of hormonal pill. It was a disaster at the end of this month. I lost so much hair yesterday that the shower was clogged. I paid $50 for this sh...I dont understand how this pill could have so many side effects when they claim it's non- hormonal and all- natural. I just want everyone to see that this \"magic pill\" is not working for everybody. I wish I knew it before. I really hope my hair will get back to normal and I will never ever touch this product again. I am scared to ever experiment with these types of pills ever again in my life. Stay away, save your hair and money.",

I also noticed it made my face, especially my nose, much oilier and shiner, which is manageable but unpleasant. Can't attest to whether it helps hair or not, because I simply couldn't tolerate it.

I read the reviews before purchasing, which questioned the authenticity of this product, but chose to ignore it since the vendor was viviscal. BIG MISTAKE. While packaging may change, and the items with older packaging are commonly reduced in price; i do not believe this is the same product as what is sold from other vivscal retailers. First, after taking this product for 3.5 weeks, I saw no change in hair loss. Second, after taking this product for 3.5 weeks I developed a horribly dry/rashy scalp. It was unbearably dry, flaky, and itchy. I decided to stop taking viviscal. My scalp eventually recovered. believing this product not to be the real deal, I purchased it at Target for $35.00. The packing is almost exactly the same but as mentioned in a previous review, the lot numbers are different. Amazon viviscal is alpha numerical, and targets in just numerical. The pill packaging is different which could fall under the packaging my vary description. The biggest and most disturbing difference is in the pill itself. The pills from target which is a verified Viviscal retailer, are denser, a totally different color and have a grainier look to it. This made me wonder what did I buy from Amazon? The pills look and smell different despite the Supplement Facts being EXACTLY the same. I have no idea what I was ingesting believing it to be Viviscal, and I would strongly recommend that NO ONE buys this from Amazon. Target might be a little bit more but it is worth it for an authentic product that does not potentially give you an awful reaction!",

I didn't think much about it and read great reviews of results so figured why not! I went to my primary for routine annual bloodwork and he called saying my liver enzymes were extremely elevated. I am otherwise very healthy and athletic, drink little alcohol. The only thing that had changed was taking this supplement! He said to stop taking it and we will repeat the bloodwork in a few months. Low and behold, my levels were back to normal! So just a word of caution to all you women who want super long hair without extensions (like me!) and think it's harmless to try this - think again! Nothing is worth potential permanent damage to your liver!!!!! After researching, I think it could be the Niacin but am not certain. Regardless, if you are taking this, please at least get bloodwork done to ensure your levels are where they need to be. xoxo",

I said I don't need to bother anymore and I can save the $...BIG MISTAKE. I noticed one of my eyebrows is thinning and I have even more shedding and breakage. I bought a box today. My hair is worth the money. Coupled with GF living I should see a turn around. For me wheat messes up my vitamin absorption. I know it does. Take this right after you eat so you don't get an upset stomach. We have yet to see a miracle out there but this is a hot item and I think for many it works. Try it.

Even my eyebrows are thicker and lashes too. Great outcome but you have to be diligent and it will take at least 2 months for you to start seeing results. The first month you will notice a lot less hair fall. By month 2 and 3 you will see hair regrowth.",

So I thought I would try and again I live life with a lot of stress and have had hair loss in past from it. Since staying on this product I have not. I now get it monthy delivered through Amazon so I do not forget to buy. I highly recommend the try. I believe any product like this there is a time period you do need to stay on before knowing. So there is a commitment I would say for a month to two months before giving up on it. I take twice a day. I hope this helps because I understand the awful feeling of some hairloss due to stress.",

Plus they're growing a fast as the grass in the lawn. After years of putting on nail extensions on finicky nails this is great! Hopefully the thinning hair will follow soon. I'll update in another month. I promised an update... WOW!!! After the 1st month (May) I could put my hair up in a French twist or pony tail, a little skimpy, but by now, the end of June it's decidedly better. Shine and thicker texture have also returned. Good bye Rogaine hello Viviscal, my new best friend. Oh yes, my nails are still growing like weeds ... no complaint there! And to think I was once thinking of getting a wig :-). Try it, you'll love it! No aside effects, only praise after taking for just beginning the 3rd month. 4 months now, (Sept 4) . Nails still growing like crazy, my French twist or pony tail is looking better. Think this is because the texture has changed. I read that you shouldn't take longer than 6 months so I'll finish up what I have in 2 weeks, and just take Biotin and prenatal vitamins which have been recommended.",

I was looking for a supplement that had a proven clinical/scientific study, not a fly by night, to good to be true hair vitamin. My hair grows at a pretty good rate as it is, so I can't say much about this supplement for growth, Some years back, my hair has lost major density after my Dr had me on alot of antibiotics for a condition that resulted in me having to have a hysterectomy. Nothing I did helped thicken it. My hair was so thin, I didn't like wearing it straight ( I'm African American)because you could see through it. Now, My hair is so thick that it takes upwards of an entire day to wash, condition, detangle and style it..and my hair is short! ( I clipper cut all my hair off 10/2016). My hair is now over 4\" all over which averages to over 1/2\" a month. If you're looking for a gimmicky product to grow your hair fast, This isn't it, but if you're looking for something to help you grow thick, healthy hair along with good eating habits, You've found the holy grail. Give it 3 months before making a sound decision on whether this is the product for you. You need to also take into consideration that If you have genetically thin hair, this product will not create thick hair. This product helps wake up dead hair follicles that previously had hair growing within it. I've been using this product since February and it's the best thing since sliced bread.",

I dyed my hair and did that for a number of years and as I got older the hair just stopped growing and starting breaking way too easily and I found I could not grow my hair at all! I found this product and I had tried a number of them over the years with few lasting results. I was desperate for something and so stuck with this and I can say, though it does take at least 3 months or maybe more to really start seeing the results-----------the results were like night and day for me!

I came across an article (Maybe in Vogue?) where the writer tried them with great results, and thought \"why not? Can't get any worse...\" I am soooo thankful that I did, because they have made a major difference for me. Enough of a difference that I have had people remark about it. I can also see about several inches of new growth around my hairline as well as it has helped my nails.

So, now I have a button to press when they annoy me during family get together, namely the holidays. So why four stars? It isn't loud enough. I'd say it's barely 60 decibels and that is your ear very close to it. 60 decibels is REGULAR speech volume, but my family is not regular. More like 90 decibels and more than that if they try to out talk each other which is a frequent occurrence, especially during the holidays. So, unless we have a moment of silence, it is hard to hear this thing. It would be perfect if it had another 25 decibels. I'd give it 3.5 stars, dropped down only because of volume.",
