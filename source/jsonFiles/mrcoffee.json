                "review_text": "I suspect this product is keeping Mr. Coffee in business. You cannot expect a product at this price to perform well, yet this machine has not let me down. I have made a latte daily in my own house since 1998; usually two or three. A day. I have no shame. I have owned a variety of expensive machines, including pump machines. The volume at which they operate is ridiculous. Next door neighbors should not be able to HEAR you simply making coffee! The Mr.Coffee model shocked me when I gave it a try about five years ago. I could not believe how well it worked and at such a quiet volume. It makes a lovely latte and perfect foam. I am certain the machine was never designed for the use ...er ...abuse I put it through. After my two to three a day habit, the machine gives out in about 6 months. That's okay by me! For the price, it does not bother me to replace it. Also, be mindful that the first five or so drinks in the new machine may have a slight metallic/plastic taste. This is normal with this (and other) machines. It will go away.",

                "review_text": "This machine is pretty compact so it does not take up too much counter space which is great. I have to admit I didn't have high expectations for an espresso machine at this price point, but my boyfriend and I are totally amazed by the espresso this machine produces. There is a slight learning curve but you figure it out really quick. I use Cafe Bustelo ground espresso and have been using the plastic tamper that comes with this machine. The majority of my shots have tasted pretty good but I always mix my shots with milk. It does produce a crema but the shots are not super syrupy or thick. There were only two times that the espresso turned out bitter but I was playing with different amounts of ground in the filter and tamping the espresso using different pressures. I noticed a lot of reviews complain about the frothing arm for milk. My frothing arm did not look the same as the one in the picture (it was actually located towards the rear of the machine - not the best location) but I figured out the best way to get hot, steaming, foaming milk. When I use this machine I have to move it toward me because of the location of the frothing arm. I removed the plastic sleeve from the wand because the plastic sleeve was causing milk to splatter everywhere which seems to be a common complaint in reviews. By removing the plastic sleeve I no longer have the milk splattering issue and I also have more control over the amount of foam I want. I can heat the milk with minimal foam, or heat the milk longer to get more sweetness and more volume. Another word of advice is to make sure you use enough water in order to get enough steam for your milk. The espresso craft holds 8 oz and numbered for 2 ounce shots. If you want four shots you need to fill water up to the top of the metal band on the craft. If you want two shots (4 oz), you need to fill the water up to the imaginary 3 shot line or higher to get enough steam to heat and froth the milk. General rule of thumb is to add 1.5 to 2 additional ounces of water for frothing the milk. Keep in mind you have to manually change the brew feature to the steam feature once the brewed espresso hits the desired number of espresso shots in the craft. Have your cup of milk ready and submerged in the frothing arm when you change the brew feature over to the steam feature. By adding the additional 1.5 - 2 ounces of water you will have more than enough steam to heat and froth your milk. I usually have enough steam to clean the frothing arm with a clean cup of water after my milk has been heated. I also noticed that milk also tends to cake the wand so have a kitchen towel or bar mop towel handy to wipe it down after each use. If you are unsure or on the fence about purchasing this machine, you should buy it! I have been using this machine every morning and multiple times on weekends to make shots of espresso, one morning I drank 8 shots.....not sure if that is healthy. But that should tell you the quality of espresso this machine produces, no one drinks 8 shots in a day if the espresso tastes bad right??? Yes, you may need to tweak your espresso brewing skills a bit to get the taste you want, but making espresso is considered an art form you perfect to get the taste you want. You cannot expect to press start, walk away, and have the perfect cup. You have to create it the you way you want it and you can with this machine.",

I got my money worth and more. I am new to the game. But I wil save up slowly for a top notch one. I have a keureg, and my wife said its more watery. But when the espresso steams, man, its so much richer, 4 shots, and we are wired. Not sure if I need to upgrade, but as I put 5 bucks aside for ever 4 shots, I will eventually upgrade, and then take this to my office. Also...I watch a few videos. And as of right now, I don't know what espresso should taste like, but for me, this model is sooo good. And I will save and be mesmerized when I upgrade. But so much better than my keureg. One thing to mention. I spent 6.75 on a bag of espresso. Still have a lot left. And loving it. Saved so much money.",

                "review_text": "Summary: This espresso maker is simply for the budget minded. I say that because it doesn't make high quality espresso, BUT it makes it good enough to satisfy most. The package comes with everything minus the cup, coffee, and water, though I will say the scoop-tamper design is nice for scooping, but doesn't do well as a tamper. I went out and bought a third party tamper and called it a day. The positives of this unit are the price first and foremost. It's not too high and the device is pretty reliable. In addition it's easy to use and steps are easy to understand. And ultimately, it's a pretty quick machine at what it does. From a cold state, it'll brew 4 shots of espresso in about 5 minutes. The negatives are quite a few... For starters the unit lacks an auto-off feature. So you're best to sit close when using it. The cool-down time is a bit longer than most espresso makers I've used (but for a single user it's not a big deal). In order to froth milk, you're best to brew first (Even if it's only brewing water) or you'll sit there for quite some time waiting on the water in the reservoir to get hot enough. The frother is a bit low, to the point where I had to position my machine on the corner of the counter to be able froth with a normal coffee cup. Other notes: If you buy an after market tamper, don't use too much pressure, the compressed grounds will create a block and pressure will build up and you'll have hot wet grounds spread across your counter-top AND in the water reservoir. The power cord can be a bit short for some, it's just over 12\" long. Noted regarding other reviews: I've been using this machine at least 5 days a week for the past 4 months and it's been working just fine for me. I've had zero issues, aside from the day I compressed the grounds a bit too much with the tamper. The machine is not at all great, but for most it will suffice your desires for espresso. If you're an espresso enthusiast or you're particular about your espresso, you should avoid this and purchase a real deal espresso maker.",

                "review_text": "This machine gets 4 stars, given that it's also only $40. In other words, I didn't have high expectations, so it's a pleasant surprise that it works at all! The short review is that it makes a perfectly acceptable shot for a latte; but the quality isn't high enough to sip it as an espresso. And it does a fine job of steaming milk. The good: \u2022 the machine itself is small, lightweight and easy to clean. Plus it was quite inexpensive, as espresso machines go! \u2022 It's a pretty simple process to make a latte. I've never owned any other machine like this, so maybe others are just as simple. \u2022 the steamer makes nice hot milk with decent foam (I actually use almond milk, so I can't say what it would do with regular milk) \u2022 after 10 days of practicing, I've figured out how to get a shot that produces a darn tasty morning latte. The bad: \u2022 it takes a LONG time to pull a shot (3 minutes?); and even when I'm only making a single 2-ounce shot, the machine slows down twice, tempting me to believe it's finished even though I have less than 2 oz of espresso in the carafe. But no, if I just wait patiently it does eventually produce a full 2 oz of espresso. \u2022 the steamer arm is poorly designed. It only sticks out about an inch from the machine, so you can't move it around much in your cup of milk. Another reviewer had recommended tossing the black casing right from the outset, so I did that too. Never even tried using it. \u2022 the shot produced by this machine doesn't have any crema at all \u2022 the cleaning instructions were insufficient: the first 3 shots I pulled, after having cleaned the machine, left a bit of white powder on top of the coffee grounds. A few usage tips: \u2022 The directions say to start by brewing your shot but then switch to steam in the middle, and then go back to finish pulling your shot after your milk is hot. That seems crazy to me so instead this is what I do: When I first turn the machine on, I start with it in the steam position. I do this after having poured my milk into a mug. While the machine is heating up, I measure out my coffee and attach the little basket to the machine. As soon as steam starts coming out, I began heating and frothing my milk. This takes about 60 seconds, for 6-8 ounces of cold milk. Once my milk is nice and hot I switch the knob to brew. \u2022 As I mentioned above, the machine acts like it's finished before the full shot has been produced. Not only does any espresso stop dripping out into the carafe, but the machine belches out a fair amount of steam, which I always thought was a sign it was done. But no, if you just wait patiently the machine starts up again (it takes about 20 seconds, so it's REALLY tempting to give up) and eventually produces a full shot.",

Still, before its death it lasted over a year of daily use (sometimes multiple times a day), so our $30 got us roughly 400-500 cups of espresso without a problem. Is it going to brew gourmet \"Starbucks\" quality espresso? No. The machines that do that are $1,000+ and we don't care to spend that much. When deciding whether to buy this unit again or get one in the $100-200 range, I found those ones have the same issues this one does and don't seem to last nearly as long, so why bother spending more? Bottom line: if you want a decent and quick espresso fix and are ok buying a new unit every year or so, this is an economical choice.",

I recommend buying this tamper RSVP Terry's Dual Sided Espresso Tamper and this metal frothing pitcher Update International (EP-12) 12 Oz Stainless Steel Frothing Pitcher . You'll get very skilled at making just the right combination of espresso to milk. One note of caution! DO NOT tamp the espresso grounds too tightly!

Now, complaint: The plastic taste is overwhelming. I think it's because it's new but nothing tastes worse than burnt plastic in a cup of good espresso. I've been washing it through with water cycles and even trying to leave the pressure cap off to let it air out, but the taste/smell has only gone away slightly and I've had it for almost a week and a half. I'm going to try to rinse it out with vinegar, I read that can help. It's helped with my Keurig before. Anyway, great product for the price, but I hope they come up with a way to eliminate that taste!",

                "review_text": "This small compact machine makes great espresso & cappuccino for $30.00. It reminds me of the Krups machine I had years ago. It's similarities made it easy to use. I was enjoying my 1st cappuccino within minutes. The only negative was the plastic sleeve to froth the cream which can be easily removed to make it work properly. My first attempt was with the plastic sleeve on and the cream splattered every where. I removed the plastic sleeve on my 2nd cup and I had no issues frothing the cream, no splatter at all. For those of you needing help making great cappuccino here are my recommendations. You do not need to use espresso grounds. I actually find that the espresso grinds are too fine and when lightly tamped down using a small spice container the steam has a hard time making it's way through the grinds and steam escapes through very small gaps thus reducing the steam for frothing. I use Militta classic blend coffee lightly tamped down with a small spice container. As far as frothing the cream or milk I highly recommend adding an extra ounce and a half of water so there is enough water to steam your cream or milk. I have lived in Italy for 3 years when I was young and the cappuccino I make using this machine and Militta coffee taste just like I remember.",

                "review_text": "This is my third home espresso machine, and I'm totally LOVING this one! Each of my previous machines lasted about 10 years each, so I'm a veteran home latte brewer! My last machine was a Mr. Coffee as well, and I was really fond of the sleek design of it, so I was initially not very thrilled about this boxy look. I considered this model for several months, only seeing it online and thinking it looked like it would take up more space than I wanted. I finally saw one in a store then immediately came home and ordered one from Amazon. It has taken some getting used to, mostly because of differences between it and my last machine, but after several weeks of daily use I now love it! What I love most is that it is REALLY FAST!!! I guess that's the drawback of a machine that lasts 10 years... you miss out on the latest technological improvements! This machine heats up incredibly fast, so 4 shots of coffee is done in less than 5 minutes, and steaming the milk takes about 30 seconds for two batches! ... I'll time it soon and update with exact times. :) The steaming wand is very short and far back, and I thought this might be an issue for me as just a personal preference thing, but it's not, at all. In fact, my previous machine had a very long wand that swept forward toward the front, and I would sometimes burn myself a little bumping into it. There is very little chance of that happening with this model. The boxy shape of the top part of the machine is made that way to be functional so you can put the carafe or portafilter parts there to dry or store while not in use, which I actually finally started doing, so now I appreciate the boxy design. The handles on the portafilter and carafe are longer than I'd like, and it makes me more nervous about knocking the glass carafe on the floor and breaking it. But I'm getting used to them after using it daily for several weeks now, and I suppose it's better for someone with very large hands. My only lingering complaint is that the lid of the glass carafe barely snaps in, so at the slightest tap against the Portafilters spout, it dislodges. This can make pouring the coffee a little messy if you don't realize it and re-seat the lid first. All around this is an amazing home espresso machine, especially for the price, and I would highly recommend it to anyone wishing to make espresso, cappuccino's or lattes at home. It would also make a wonderful gift!",

Also, don't forget to clean the steamer every time you use it, and make sure that some steam comes out at the end, if not the steamer will get clogged. The part that I didn't like was that you are able to make only 2 cups of espresso at a time (if you are looking for a late or capuccino) main reason is because you need half the water to brew the coffee and half the water to steam the milk. If you are not a pro like me and you are looking for a good espresso machine, this is the one. I''ve had this coffee maker for about a year and it is great. A lot of comments said that it would explode and things like that but, after I've been using it I think theirs exploded because it wasn't closed properly or coffee deposit was not installed correctly.

First, it's super easy to use. I like the fact that it stops automatically after making the amount of water you put in there. Second, it brews a consistent cup, which I like as well.

It was for sale at a cheaper price then, but I still think it's worth the price for which it's being offered now. I've had several espresso/cappuccino machines, most 4xs the price, and this has held up better than most. I write this review because one thing is really important....regular cleaning and maintenance are very important. I have discovered that if I put 1/3 vinegar with 2/3 water in the machine and run it like that weekly, I can keep using this without any issues. I also run that water through the steamer to make sure things run smoothly with that as well. The other thing that I have found works better is to simply remove the plastic cap on the steam wand. It produced bubbles and no froth. Without it I've been able to get a really nice froth.",

We have limited counter space in our house, and the espresso machine is so compact that it has a permanent spot on the countertop. I was intimidated because I did not know how to use an espresso machine. It is the easiest thing in the world!!!! Easier than brewing coffee--seriously! it is super self-explanatory. The ONLY \"negative\" thing I found out about it is the milk frother. I don't even hardly use it because it doesn't come very far out from the machine itself, so to actually swirl the milk to get it frothy and heated through consistently is a pain. Believe it or not, I have scraped my knuckles trying to swirl a glass measuring cup underneath it. I just heat my milk in the microwave while the espresso is brewing. It doesn't give it that frothy texture, but who cares....when you have 10-15 minutes in the morning before going to work, you are not going to mess with the milk frother anyway! Overall, I give it a 10/10!",

After reading the manual I found that I had not been cleaning the steaming arm well enough. This would be my only complaint, it is very difficult to get the steaming arm completely clean each time. You would need to essentially do a deep cleaning of the arm immediately after each use to keep it perfectly clean. This would mean risking a burn (as the steaming arm is incredibly hot at this point) and by the time you would be done cleaning your drink would be cold. Overall, this machine does do the trick. It make good espresso shots for the price of the machine. I would recommend purchasing a tamper for the espresso grounds and a pitcher of you plan on steaming milk.",

                "review_text": "This is perhaps the fifth Mr. Coffee espresso maker I have bought in my life. They are not expensive and need to be replaced about once every couple of years if you use it every day - but they are way cheaper than buying cappuccino everyday, even if you buy the machine once a year! That is how I look at it. They produce great foam (I automatically remove the plastic cover that comes on the foaming apparatus and do not use it; I just don't need it and I feel like it foams it before it heats it - probably because I steam the milk right in my coffee cup, which is small compared to a foaming carafe). And they produce a decent espresso. It is not thick espresso, but it is adequate. I know espresso is supposed to pour at a certain thickness per second - but I am not that technical or picky. I have bought a model every couple of years since I was a freshman in college in 2001 - I recommend it to someone who likes cappuccino, doesn't want to pay three dollars a day for coffee, and who is not an aficionado. How do I know when it is time to replace my machine? Either the foamer or the espresso making part just quits working, it sputters and takes forever to produce coffee, even after I give it a vinegar rinse. Then it is cheaper to replace than to fix. Tip: using distilled water from the grocery store prolongs the life of this product significantly. Another tip: if your water is hard, like well water from Michigan or Florida, DO NOT PUT IT IN THIS MACHINE. Hard water clogs this thing fast. I think this would be true of any espresso maker, however.",

I've been buying from our work cafe for years now, since they serve white coffee, but I resolved this year to save money and brew my own. After reviewing a few of the lower priced units on here (lets admit, I'm only using this for personal use, so I'm not too picky), I decided on the Mr Coffee ECM160 model, and was pleasantly rewarded. The machine itself appears relatively sturdy and compact, and fits quite nicely on my counter. As other reviewers mentioned, it is necessary in some cases to unwind the cord at the base for additional length. I did not have to, where I have it located. The stainless steel finish is nice, and I like the ridged top - it makes it easy to clean. The carafe and lid are dishwasher safe, as is the basket, although I prefer to hand-wash. But, for convenience sake, this could be noted. I find that the scoop included works well for standard espresso, but when making white coffee (my preferred method), it's best to err on the side of under-filling, as the white coffee seems to expand more when the steam is pressed through. For four shots, it takes roughly 5 minutes to brew, and I plan on taking the recommendations of others and cleaning/descaling with vinegar on a regular basis to prevent any slowness. I do the same for my Keurig, it's just part of basic maintenance. The steaming attachment is kinda cheesy with the plastic case, so I just take that off (I find it's easier for me to clean without it). I use it to heat/foam my milk, and as I mentioned in the title, it foams like a beast! I use rice milk, and have had NO problems whatsoever in building an absurd amount of foam. It takes a few minutes and some angling, but it's not a pain by any means, and as a foam lover, totally worth it. For $40, I love this machine. The plastic bits aren't as fancy as a professional espresso, but I'm in this for utility, not looks. We make 2-3 espressos daily, and on Sundays I pre-brew a quart jar of white coffee so I can add it to my breakfast protein shake with ease. It gives me a great extra kick to the day, and it's great knowing that a week's worth of coffee has already paid for itself.",

I've always had basic Krups espresso makers with the nob that let you steam while you were brewing coffee.They are OK. I don't own a coffee tamper because the Krups machine wasn't powerful enough to push through packed coffee. If you get this machine get a coffee tamper and use it. When I make caf\u00e9 lattes for my husband and I -- I fill the carafe with cold water just a little above the silver band. That way I have enough water for the espresso and milk steaming. I'll let the espresso brew a little so there is maybe 1/2 inch or so of espresso in the carafe then I switch it to steam and take the milk to about 137 degrees, then I switch back to the brew side and finish. We each have a regular size mug of caf\u00e9 latte. The frother works very well but we don't like a lot of foam so I won't use it much. The Mr. Coffee brew basket holes are just a titch bigger than the holes in my Krups brew basket. (probably like a micron or so, I'm not an engineer.) I wondered if grounds would come through but there is no problem. I use the first espresso grind on the commercial coffee grinder and all is well. You can spend a lot of money on exotic pump machines and there is nothing wrong with that. But this Mr. Coffee is great and serves the purpose. Once you taste a good caf\u00e9 latte or cappuccino you are hooked : )",

If you just position the nozzle barely under the surface of the milk, you can make a beautiful foam. The reason for 4 stars rather than 5... the cap and the knob are both too smooth and do not allow for a good grip. You really need to be careful not to accidentally cross thread the cap when sealing the tank. While they're pretty, they're not very practical. Earlier models had a much better surface on both for better control. Overall, a very good espresso machine, especially for the price.",

My husband drinks a double shot every morning, and then the machine rests until next morning. We have noticed, as other reviews have said, that if you are making two espressos in a row, the second one isn't as good. I've never tried the steamed milk part, but I get plenty of crema on the espresso. You have to figure out the best grind and how hard to tamp the grinds. Making espresso is not an exact science, and that is the fun of it! I use a spice bottle for tamping, which works perfectly. I cannot see spending more money for a machine when this one meets our needs so well. UPDATE - Here is how you make the best espresso with this newer model of the ECM160 espresso machine. First, have your beans ground to Turkish grind, the finest grind on commercial grinders. Or just grind your own beans super fine. For one shot, loosely fill the basket about 3/4 full. Tamp very gently to about 1/2 full. Do all your prep, turn machine on. The espresso will come out fairly steadily, and you'll think its done. Wait. Some crema will bubble out. Wait some more. Finally a solid stream of crema emerges. Leave the machine on for awhile until you are sure all moisture is out of the machine. Otherwise, it ends up in your next expresso, making the coffee watery. It took me awhile to figure all this out, but the espresso is excellent with about 1/2 of it crema. If this sounds complicated, it really isn't. I just wanted to be very specific in my explanation.",

(of course, even the best machines won't make a good cup of espresso if you don't start with GOOD coffee, properly ground)... I definitely recommend it. HOWEVER: The steaming wand on my machine clogged after a few months of use... there aren't any instructions or anything about cleaning the steaming wand... let me make a few suggestions that I have mostly figured out by myself, with little or no help from Mr. Coffee: The cover for the wand is unnecessary and bothersome. Just remove it and don't bother. The tip of the wand unscrews and can be cleaned separately. Do that often. You may have to use a pair of pliers to \"break it loose\" and to tighten it sufficiently when you put it back on-- there is supposedly a built-in \"wrench\" on the handle of the measuring scoop, but it may or may not actually be effective. It's probably necessary to clean the steaming wand tip often (definitely every use, force some steam out of the wand when you're done to 'blow it clear'... Mr. Coffee recommends that you delime the machine every 40-80 brews, same as with a regular coffeemaker (use vinegar, then flush with clear water a few times)... clean the steaming wand tip at least this often-- probably much more often. You probably want to put a cup or something under the steaming wand while you are waiting for it to get up to temp/pressure... water will drip, the steam will be \"wet,\" etc. while you're waiting...

But my longest relationship in this life was with my Cappucino Machine - over twenty five years. So you can appreciate that I was upset when my Riviera finally broke for good. Actually that's not completely true. I could possibly have gotten it fixed yet again. But the machine is out of production. Some parts are still available but not all. One of the parts no longer available is one of the seals. The result of that missing seal has been that for about a year now when I try to make my daily cappucino it would spray boiling water in my face. Not a good feature. I would drape a paper towel over it so as to intercept the spray. It leaked elsewhere too. It still looked cool of course. Solid crome over solid brass with a pressure dial and an eagle on top. The last time I saw one on sale they were well over a thousand dollars. But in fact it was the maintenance that cost a lot not just the initial purchase price. I had sent it into the shop every two years for new seals. Each trip was about $150. So a week or so ago when it wouldn't turn on - probably a switch again - I called it quits. I resolved to get a new machine. I expected to spend about $800 (the cost of a new Pavoni). To my delight it looked as though I could get a \"starter\" automatic machine for only about $400. But as it happens my twenty year old car needed a new transmission and that cost $4,000. So I decided to get some sort of interim machine for now until my finances recovered. I knew as soon as I openned the box that I wouldn't send it back. That was because I immediately dropped the glass carafe on the kitchen floor, shattering it into a million shards. The other problem was that the directions require you to measure the water in that carafe. So I had to improvise my brewing procedure. Fortunately this is a truly simple machine. I have devised a procedure that makes a wonderful cappucino. I am no longer in the market for a more expensive machine. Like the song says \"Ich habe genug\". Considering what I have been accustomed to spending on my morning coffee, this machine is really cheap. I could just throw it away every year and buy a new one and still come out ahead. It is almost a disposable cappucino maker. My former machine, the Riviera, was all metal. This machine is all plastic. You could sneak it through a metal detector. It is very lightly built. But I think nevertheless that it will last. My sold brass Riviera had a big boiler that took a while to come up to temperature. I would turn it on first thing in the morning and leave it on all day. That meant that the rubber seals inside cooked all day. That's why I had to have them replaced nearly every year. This little machine has a little boiler that heats up fast. I fill it with water and turn it on. Then I quickly find a cup, get out the milk, grind the beans and tamp. These actions take about five minutes at which time the coffee starts coming out. When there's enough (but not too much) I switch it to steam and froth the milk. Then - and this is the important point - I turn it off. It takes me about six minutes to make a cappucino. The Mr. Coffee is only on for those six minutes. It makes a great cup of Joe. It has only one flaw. Chicks are not impressed with it the way they always were with my gleaming chrome Riviera.",

Everything about this machine is wonderful, but three things to know before you buy it: 1) The scoop you get free with this machine has a tamper built in... The scoop is very small and the bottom doesn't tamp down well. I spill more grounds when I try to use it. I use a 2TBSP flat bottom measuring cup which is great for scooping and packing, but the scoop works, just buy a tamper. 2) Steam escapes from ALL around this unit. Be sure not to have anything that shouldn't be moist near of above the machine while brewing or steaming. 3) The glass carafe is very delicate. It cracks easily with sudden temperature changes, and shatters if it drops a few inches. It really is a great value, despite these few issues.",

                "review_text": "Have had this machine for 18 months now, and both my husband and I love the results. Fortunately I'm a reader of directions; you really need to study them carefully before you brew your first pot. It took half a dozen rounds of delicious experimentation to tweak the original instructions. Now I have the process down to a science, with detailed instructions posted next to the machine. In all these months, after many expensive comparisons, we have yet to taste a commercial cappuccino that tastes as good as ours. I did order a steaming pitcher with the machine but found it much too small for our milk use. I have ended up using it just for depressurizing the machine, for which it's perfect. For my household, the best steaming pitcher is an ordinary one-pint glass measuring cup. And the best tamper turned out to be a flat-bottomed scoop from a can of protein-powder I had sitting around. As other reviewers have pointed out, the quality of the coffee beans is critical. We buy the best organic espresso beans we can afford (Trader Joe's has a great blend) and grind them fresh each morning for that morning's two batches. We also use distilled water for the most flavorful coffee of any kind. I had read that caffeine reacts with the chlorine in tap water; it certainly makes a noticeable difference in taste. Tip for a good foam: cold milk in a cold pitcher. At the start of preparations, I pour 1 1/3 cups cold almond milk in my 1-pint glass measuring cup and stick it in coldest spot of the refrigerator. The colder the pitcher, the thicker the foam. This morning, I had placed the pitcher right underneath the freezer motor and the milk had ice crystals on top. For the first time, the froth came out so dense and hard that it looked and behaved like whipped cream! So far, this sounds like a five-star machine. Unfortunately, early on, it developed a problem that cost it one star. The screw at the end of the steam wand lost its thread and has to be carefully forced into place. Last weekend, it came loose at the end of the second round and the machine spewed steam all over the place. I had already steamed the milk to near-perfection, so nothing was lost. The depressurizing process was messy and noisy, and the screw had to be forced out the plastic shield with a sharp metal object. But this weekend I managed to get the screw back in place both mornings, and our cappuccino was better than ever. Not to gamble with our future weekend treats, I'm now ordering a spare machine, just in case. Fortunately the price is right!",

                "review_text": "To the engineer that posted detailed instructions on how you should use this machine. Your a genius! I have followed your advice from day one and not had one problem with this unit. This is a great little machine for not a lot of $$$$. I have saved a lot of $$$ making my own latte's. Sorry Starbucks I love you but....... I can make my own now :) I Here are the instructions I follow. If you follow the directions included with the machine to a tee your going to get disappointing water logged coffee. But if you have a basic understanding of pressure and steam you'll need to modify your operation of this little machine. What I do is fill the coffee filter holder to max shot coffee level line and use a coffee tamper to compress the espresso but don't pack it to tight just a simple tamp is all you need because your going to want to stop the excess water rush when the thick black coffee and cream stops pouring. I use only purified water unless you want your machine to last only 1 year from mineral deposits, and I fill glass carafe to reach the bottom of the metal band to ensure more than enough water and steam to do the job. With everything in place i.e. power off, coffee filter holder fully locked in, steam cap screwed down tight, frothing arm extended and ready with cup and milk standing by... I then turn the machine to knob to steam first to allow the machine to build pressure and steam without prematurely diluting the coffee filter holder, as soon as the frothing arm starts to sputter and produce steam with a hint of water I quickly switch the control knob to brew coffee position which brings in only hot steam and water trickling out only dark thick coffee and this is where you have to be rehearsed to act fast and operate the machine effectively! With the thick black coffee trickling, get your milk cup ready sitting under the frothing arm ready to be lifted up as soon as you see the brewing coffee go from slow tricking thick dark coffee to cream foam. It should have reached the first like on the coffee pot at this point. Now GET READY to turn the control knob back to steam the INSTANT you see that the slow dark cream foam trickling out slowly starts to speed up. The moment before you see the slow dark cream foam trickling out start to speed up to water, I Instantly raise my milk cup submersing the frothing arm under the milk to avoid splatter while simultaneously switching the control knob to steam, which instantly stops the brewing process to the coffee filter holder preventing water dilution. Turn the knob slowly once on the steam side and work your way up to full steam if you switch too quickly you will get a milk volcano lol. Once your milk is frothed to your liking. switch the control knob to off. That's it, perfect Espresso. Be sure to once you've made your coffee clear the rest of the steam from the unit once your done and clean the froth arm. I wipe the outside of the plastic cover then take it off and wipe down the metal portion to clean the steamed on milk off. Then I replace the plastic cover and turn the steam back on to clear out all the rest of the water and steam from the unit. This will clean the frothing arm but also release all the pressure that has built up in the machine. Once all the steam is released take the lid off the top of the water compartment and let the machine cool. Doing this when not in use will help prevent premature compression damage to the sealing gaskets, I only slightly keep both the steam cap and the filter holder screwed in place. If you lock them down to full tight position when not in use, I find that it will prematurely compress the sealing gaskets and they will start to leak early making brewing ineffective. Having said all of this, as a protective disclaimer I must say that this is what \u201cI DO\u201d and I'm not recommending any of these operating actions to anyone. \"You should use the instruction book to a tee for OK strong watery coffee if that's what your after.\" Thanks E. Gonzales for your review. My coffee machine works like a charm and I have beautiful crema on my espresso every time. I did tweak his original instructions for user use and understanding as well as maintenance. ENJOY!! Your now a barista!",

                "review_text": "I received my unit a while ago and, after getting used to fiddling with all the pieces and waiting for the \"explosion\" described in other posts, I am completely satisfied and somewhat disappointed (no explosion). I can see where other reviewers might be mislead into thinking the cord is very short but all you have to do is turn the machine over and actually look at the place where the cord is stashed to see there is a pretty lengthy cord wound around a very clever stem in a hidden compartment. As for the quality: I had been using a Hamilton Beach machine that is very different in operation so reviewing the instructions fully really was a must. Based on other comments, clearly most people don't read or follow the instructions because everything you need to know is there in black and white. The brew function is very quick and only takes about 15-20 seconds to heat the water in the reservoir and start running hot water through the grounds. The whole process is very quick and you can fill the carafe with 4oz in less than a half minute. My other machine had a reservoir that you could leave full but this machine discourages that. I use a Brita filter for all my water so the chances of mineral buildup are reduced a little. Seeing how hot the reservoir gets, I would not recommend leaving water in the reservoir. The carafe has a slotted lid so the spout from the filter fits neatly into the top of the carafe so there is no spilling or splash. The steamer arm is fixed with no allowed movement but it is spaced high enough and far enough out from the main body that using a pitcher or coffee cup to froth milk is very easy. The booklet goes into very specific detail about how to clean the froth arm but the pressure of the steam basically blasts the nozzle clean if you allow the unused water in the reservoir to exit through the froth arm when you are done making your foam. A barrista friend of mine steams a clean towel then uses that to clean the foam nozzle on her own machine. I find that works well between proper cleanings. One note is that Soy milk froths well but leaves a film from all the dissolved solids. If you use Soy milk, plan on cleaning the nozzle frequently as the particles get to be like glue if they are not wiped off shortly after being warmed. As for which grounds to use, I have tried both standard grind and espresso grind coffees and you definitely need to find a finer ground of coffee for use in this (and any) espresso machine. I have a lot of Starbucks standard grind coffee to use up so I simply sent it through my Cuisinart for a few minutes to get it broken up finer. It seems to work equally as well but there is a noticeable difference in brewing strength. Overall, I am very pleased.",

I was letting some steam out after I was done foaming as he suggests and was also using a cup of water with Dawn detergent to foam up and clean it after every use, it's not enough it still got clogged. I unscrewed the tip and cleaned both the wand and tip, a thin wire for the wang and a needle on the tip, runned a full load of steam and I'm back in bussiness.

                "review_text": "At first, I thought about giving this product a lower rating, but I changed my mind, and here's why: First, and most important to me, this machine makes good espresso. Furthermore, it makes it fairly quickly and quietly. Couldn't be happier with that result! Second, and here's the negative, I need to address the auto-frothing wand. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this or not, but the auto-frothing wand that came with my machine was a piece of plastic crap. I had to experiment several times, but each time I used it, I was disappointed. The results were always the same, huge bubbles in the froth on top and hot, thin milk on the bottom, not exactly the foamy, creamy experience everyone wants! I watched some videos on how to froth milk, but no matter what I tried, it was always the same. Then I had a friend who works as a barista at a local coffee shop try it, but she also could not get anything but huge bubbles and hot, thin milk. We decided that the machine produced too much air pressure. I was considering returning the machine, but I decided to try to take the plastic auto-frothing wand off and try to do it manually. My expectations were low, because I thought the fault was with the inner workings of the machine. I'm glad I tried the manual way though, because it actually worked! Using the video techniques I found for manual frothing, I was able to get much closer to making the smaller bubbles for the foam and a creamy consistency throughout the milk. Obviously, it wasn't perfect because I'm still a noob, but I'd imagine someone who really knows what they're doing would easily pull it off. Having said that, I believe the issue was that the auto-frothing wand actually allows way too much air into the milk in the initial frothing stage. However, going manually, I was allowed to control exactly how much air was being added and how quickly it was being added. So, my advice, ditch that little plastic piece of garbage and go manual! It may take a little more practice, but I believe it'll pay off. Third, as pretty much all the other reviews have said, the scoop really does not work as an effective tamper. However, I would not pay the $10-$18 necessary to buy an espresso tamper. For one thing, it's a uni-tasker, which is almost always a big no-no and a good indication that you're wasting money. For another thing, if you have tools at home, you could easily make one yourself. Or, you can do what I did and just use the top of a medicine bottle that you have lying around. A lot of them have the 49mm diameter you need or close to it. Finally, in summary, you can't beat the price on this machine, and it does it's job well. I've had it for about a week now, and it's already been through a quite a few uses. It's worked great! Just make sure that you're cleaning it properly, releasing the pressure after every use, and making sure that no water is left in the machine between uses (that should solve the \"exploding\" problems that other customers have experienced). The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars were for the uselessness of the auto-frothing wand and the scoop. Other than that, it's a fantastic buy!",

The Monster drinks helped her get started in the mornings. I bought this device to see if I could cure her Monster Drink Addiction. It has worked so far. Each morning I now make her an Espresso, a Latte, or a cappuccino. This device makes either of them pretty simple to produce in about 15 minutes counting preparation and clean up time afterwards. After a couple hours of watching youtube tutorials online I not only understood what the differences between the three drinks are, but how to actually make them. If you need some help to understand how to use your new espresso machine, watch this tutorial. It's pretty darn good -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxA5EB-gHcE Youtube is also how I learned how to use the steam wand. A little tricky but once you know how, it's not all that difficult. If you want to learn, check out this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsHacrTIXh4 The guy isn't using a Mr. Coffee espresso machine, but the principles are the same. It sure helped me a whole lot. My wife claims that the drinks I create for her now make her even more alert than after previously drinking her Monster drink, and she also actually likes the coffee taste even more than the Monster drinks. Do not order the Terry's Tamper for Espresso device that is listed along with the 12 ounce pitcher as a package deal. You will end up returning it and then ordering another one just as I did a few minutes ago after receiving it in the mail yesterday. This Tamper will not work with your machines filter unless you are brewing 4 cups. With a two cup amount, the Terry's Tamper will simply not work. You won't even be able to touch the coffee grounds with this device because it has too large a diameter. I considered dropping one of my 5 stars for that reason, but that wouldn't be fair. It has nothing to do with how well the espresso machine works, but it is certainly very irritating. I don't know how long this device will last, but at $29, my gosh, it really isn't that much of a pain to buy a replacement. I knew nothing about coffee, Espresso, Lattes, or Cappuccinos before buying this device. I had no idea what made them different. I did not like coffee, and had never made regular coffee or either of these three other variations before. I still don't like coffee, but my wife does, and that is why I bought the machine. Two months ago I bought a large supply of monster drinks when they were on sale. I now have 200+ cans of Monster in my basement. I expect that my wife will want an occasional can of Monster, so I'm ready for at least 200 cravings that she might have. I hope that after the cans are gone, I will never have to buy another one of them again. Going to the store, buying and grinding the coffee beans right there in the store, and then making the Espresso at home on this very cool device, is a lot easier than hauling home cans of Monster, and probably a whole lot healthier. We like it a lot.",

When I figured out that I could have had my kitchen counters re-done for what I spend at Starbucks in 6 months (!), I knew I had to learn to make my own lattes. I bought this little sweetheart and gave it to the DH for the kids to give me for xmas. I read all the reviews and the directions, plus looked up Starbucks syrup-pump volumes online. So I knew there would be no tamper per se (the scoop is the tamper) or pitcher (I just use a ceramic syrup pitcher). And I knew how much syrup I wanted (see recipe below). First time out, the brew was bitter and the milk was cold. The directions say that too fine a grind makes a bitter brew (oops), but I knew from the reviews (thanks, reviewers!)that your tamp can compensate for that. So since my grind is too fine, I tamped very lightly the second time - that fixed that problem. Also my milk wasn't steamed enough because I hadn't put enough extra water in the reservoir for steaming - the second time I followed the instruction manual amounts for cappuccino, which gave me enough extra water with which to steam my milk. Problems solved! Latte was perfect that second time around. My recipe for grande soy caramel latte: Espresso for 2 cups, water for 2 cups cappuccino (manual says 5.5 oz but I know that 6 oz = 3/4 cup so I just throw in 3/4 cup because that's easier...), brew, plus 1/8 cup of syrup (grande = 4 pumps ... at .35 oz per pump, per the SB website, 4 pumps= about 1.5 oz = which is more than 1/8 cup, but I want a little less sugar), plus 4ish oz vanilla soy milk (or milk of choice of course)- steamed. Put the syrup in your mug first, then the brewed espresso, then pour the steamed soy milk while using a spoon to hold back the foam, then use the spoon to plop the foam on the top. YUM! :) Enjoy!",

This means you have to shut it once you get enough coffee or it will continue to brew until it runs out of water. So either shut it off on time or add the exact amount of water you want. Frothing pipe doesn't move The lid can be hard to open and close (otherwise the steam like out of it) Doesn't come with a pitcher",

After doing research I looked for my own espresso machine/steamer. All of them were over $100 and I found this one for $40. Since it was so much cheaper I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing. I just made my first drink and it tastes so yummy! Make sure you read the directions or watch an online tutorial to use the machine otherwise you will be lost and may end of breaking the machine. Also be sur to clean everything first including just running water through the machine without any coffee (the instructions explain this too). I watched a tutorial on YouTube on how to make the drink and use the machine so that was really helpful. The only thing I would recommend based on reading the reviews as well is to buy at least a 12 ounce frothing pitcher. I bought a 10 ounce and it seems a bit small. Also some reviews say to buy a tamper however you would be fine just using the spoon that this machine comes with. Ive never been a barista or anything so this machine is perfect for me. For my flavorings I got Ghiradelli sauces for $20 for a pack of 3 on amazon (chocolate, white chocolate, and carmel). I would suggest this come with a frothing pitcher, thats my only negative. I did my research so I knew what to expect but if I didnt know that I would have been a bit frusterated. All in all, so far so good!! Now, back to my mocha :)",

UPDATE: You don't want to OVERPACK your coffee to hard, it will create to much back pressure and steam will come out everywhere. You do want to seat and seal the coffee pot handle, all the way to the right, not just the middle or it will build up pressure and leak. Turn it pass center and a little to the right, for a good seal. Don't forget to turn it off and you might release the pressure, by turning it to 'steam' for a 'few seconds' and then off.",

The only reason we threw it away is because the side knob handle broke off. Otherwise it was still functioning. The side knob pole that goes from the knob to the machine is made of plastic and ripped off the hinge. So one thing to be careful on is to always hold the knob at the base and turn it slowly to avoid damage. The day it broke I was in a rush and grabbed it at the tip and twisted the internal plastic pole. I suspect over time more crap got into the metal and made it harder to turn. But I will admit I wasnt very good about cleaning it, too lazy. When the coffee tasted like crap is when I ran the vinegar and cleaning instructions... bad espresso machine owner, BAD! But I feel the \"Mr. Coffee ECMP50 Espresso/Cappuccino Maker, Black\" is a superior product and 100% worth the $80 they are asking. There is a significant difference. It foams, unlike this model, and the taste is better. (Angy's lazy espresso cleaner husband)",

                "review_text": "The greatest thing about this machine is indeed the price. You can buy a new one every year and still pay less over ten years than you would for some of the expensive machines out there. And there is nothing to say that the expensive ones will even last that long. It does make a good, strong cup of coffee, and that is its major strength. It is also easy to operate and keep clean. The frother is quite effective. Overall, I like the simplicity of the design. There are lots of extra, unnecessary parts to fuss with. This is the third one of this model that I've had. There are, however, several negatives. First, this is not a real espresso machine. It uses steam, not pressure, and it will not give you any real crema. The selector knob can be a bit difficult to grasp if it's dry and/or you have dry hands. The lid to the carafe becomes increasingly loose as the tabs designed to hold it in place gradually give way. I had to glue rubber surface savers onto it to keep the lid from falling off. The carafe lip is poorly designed and will dribble if you aren't careful. The plastic \"keeper\" for the coffee basket won't last. I prefer to put a little duck tape around the inside basket and have it stick in the holder on its own. Finally, the selector knob on my first machine broke after about eleven months of use, and my replacement machine has just died due to the same problem. So, it's lasted a bit over a year and a half, and that is probably not too bad, but I'm thinking of moving up to something different to see if I can still get a reasonably inexpensive machine that will make good coffee. Bottom Line: Good coffee at a low price.",

If you enjoy espresso and don't want to blow your budget on an expensive machine get this one. If you are making a single \"2\" serving I would add extra water so you have enough steam to froth milk then steam wand clean in water after wards. It seems if you vent all the steam there is really only one drop or two of moisture left in reservoir which will quickly dry if you leave the tank lid off for a minute or so. update 1/12/2014 the machine still works fine but I am upgrading to a De'Longhi BAR32 Retro 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker. I really prefer the espresso with thick crema. This Mr. Coffee is a steam driven espresso machine, it makes espresso a bit on the sour side for me.

I Remember reading a review that mentioned that they removed the plastic sleeve to keep the milk from splattering everywhere. When removing the sleeve the plastic taste was gone and the milk doesn't splatter! The instructions were clear and easy to understand.

It arrived last week and so far, I'm very impressed. It makes good espresso and I'm especially impressed by how well it froths the milk. Steaming milk tends to be a noisy process, but this machine is the quietest I've used. It's also fast- I've typically started the milk in the microwave to speed up the process, but with this machine, it goes from fridge to frothy in only a couple minutes. The foam is also robust enough that the caramel sits on top before it settles down, which is more difficult to accomplish with the skim milk I use. The only drawback I've found is that the espresso is a little slow to start brewing, but that could be a result of the filtered water I use right out of the fridge. Overall, it seems to be a very good little machine and you can't beat the small footprint on the counter- a definite plus if you have limited counterspace like me. An additional note- I haven't used plastic snap-on frothing tip yet, as I just haven't seen the need. Just make sure you clean off the steam arm carefully after each use, as in the past, I've found that any residue that develops quickly becomes impossible to remove. A wet paper towel used right after you finish does the trick.",

                "review_text": "My wife likes her coffee dark and strong. And when I say \"dark and strong,\" I mean that she finds the darkest roast she can - the closer to pitting soil the better - and then uses 7 scoops (not the normal 5) for a 10-cup pot. Even at these settings, though, sometimes her coffee just wasn't strong enough for her. It was really only that first cup that did it for her. Teh rest of the pot was just a tad weak. We tried going to 8 scoops, but that was too much for our coffee maker. It often spilled put of the basket while brewing, getting grounds in her coffee. I suggested making two pots each morning, but she didn't want to do all that before going to work. She just wanted to turn the machine on and pour. We tried a Keurig, filling the reusable K-Cup with our own coffee. That still didn't do the trick. So, I decided that we needed to try an espresso maker. Of course, I wasn't going to spend $150 or $300 on an experiment. So, I got her this one for Christmas. It's been wonderful. She gets exactly what she needs from her coffee now. I was worried at first. Some of the reviews mentioned problems with brewing, and it doesn't come with a tamper. We've had no brewing problems. As for a tamper, a bottled of Mrs. Dash's seasoning works just fine. The two other issues that kept coming up in reviews were the fact that the wand was immobile and that the machine wouldn't steam. Yes, the wand is stuck in place. That can be a problem if you're too energetic in your frothing. If that's an issue for you or your mugs are too big, you probably shouldn't get this machine. For us, we figured out how to move our pitcher in smaller circles, and it's been just fine. As for not steaming/frothing, I think I figured out the problem that most people complaining about this are having. This machine holds enough water for 4 \"cups\" of espresso. If you pour in 4 and make 4 shots of espresso, THERE WON'T BE ANY MORE WATER TO STEAM/FROTH YOUR MILK! So, you'll need to do one of two things. First, you can pour in 4 \"cups\" of water while only making 2 shots of espresso. This has been fine for us. Second, you could make four shots of espresso, refill the water, and then steam your milk. This is where the real drawback comes in, though. You obviously don't want to do this too quickly because you might burn yourself releasing the little bit of leftover steam. On the other hand, if you wait too long, your espresso is cold. This is probably what you want to think about most before buying this: \"Do I usually make 4 or more shots of espresso that need steamed/frothed milk?\" If you do, I'd say this machine won't be for you. However, if you can get by with making 2 or 3 shots, you should enjoy this. And, most of all, if what you want is a very good, very inexpensive espresso maker, this is for you.",

                "review_text": "Update: After 5 Days of Use The machine is still a good low cost espresso machine and I retain the 4 stars. However, I have to take back the fact that it's a fantastic coffee machine. If you use the specified amount of beans with the water, it makes a great espresso. However, trying to use it as a coffee machine by adding more water is not so good. The problem lies in the the fact that the pressurized steam water literally shoots like a jet rocket half way through. This cause the water to essentially pass through the grind that's already been drained of flavor super heated, adding a cigarette/ashe taste to the robust inital drain. I wasn't expecting so much pressure from the machine. Expensive pump based machines aren't like this and can be used as a coffee like machine. I'll just use it as an espresso machine, as it was meant to be. My Mr Coffee 4 cup coffee machine, which is discontinued i think, still is the best coffee machine. ----------------------------------------------------- I'm a very picky coffee drinker, who is also budget conscious. I've gone through years of evolution in my coffee brewing techniques to try to brew the best tasting coffee at the lowest price. My current setup is a 4 cup Mr Coffee coffee maker with a Krups burr grinder. Previously, I used to use a Krups coffee maker with a cone filter and the typical low end spinning blade grinder. I was reasonably satisfied with the current setup, but wanted a stronger punch to the coffee flavor, closer to an espresso. The Mr Coffee coffee machine is the best coffee maker, because it had a water drip that wasn't just a one hole in the center like 99% of the coffee makers, but had multiple drip holes that truelly spread the water over much of the beans. This extracted the maximum flavor from the coffee beans. However, I still felt that a hotter water like steam and more concentrated wetting of all the beans would bring out the maximum flavor. This is where Mr Coffee ECM160 espresso machine came into the picture. Because the water comes down as super heated steam level into a tiny sealed container spread over the entire surface area, the maximum flavor extraction is achieved. This makes a fantastic strong flavor coffee with equal amount of beans as my previous coffee machine, which means I can use even less beans and still make a better tasting coffee. I can put in 2 servings worth of coffee grind with 4 servings of water (espresso), which equates to about 2 cups of coffee, and it still taste better and stronger then when i used twice the amount of beans in a regular coffee machine. If your used to using a coffee filter so u don't get the fine coffee grinds, you will initially be dissapointed with the murky trasparency of the coffee. However, the way to get around this is use a metal mesh Krups cone filter, as a filter to pour the coffee into your mug or cup. This removes any large grinds and you end up with a fantastic coffee with incredibly strong robust flavor. As far as making an espresso, all you need to do is just use less water. It does create that mild foam that most expensive espresso machine make, but not as good. But the flavor is almost identical to a $200 espresso machine I've used in the past at work. I can't speak for the foaming stick, cuz I don't make cappucinos. Now, why only 4 stars ? Well, the huge power on off wheel on the left is an overkill, and takes up alot of space. They could have just had 1 on/off switch for brewing and 1 button for the foaming stick. As mentioned by another reviewer, the aluminum molded water container/heating element could be health issue if it ever degrades over time. IMO, it will be fine as long as u follow the direction to NOT open the pressure lid until the machine has fully cooled off. This is to prevent the water drying up inside the aluminum holding tank while it's super hot, causing the minerals to deposit and break down the aluminum from both heat, minerals, and chemicals. It also does not come with a tamper, and the plastic scooper it comes has an inadequate tiny flat bottom that your supposed to use as tamper. It does not fit properly to tamper down the coffee without making a mess. You do need to use a real tamper or, if you don't want to buy a tamper, you can use anything round that is flat and large enough to press down the coffee grind uniformly. A 49 mm tamper fits perfectly, as it is large enough for full 4 servings of grind and small enough to go lower to press down 2 servings of grind. It doesn't come with a foaming container, but I didn't expect it to. However, I think it should have come with atleast a cheap plastic tamper that fits. Now the bonus of using this machine over a regular coffee machine, is that you don't have to buy coffee filters AND you don't have to use those white cholorinated 4 cup coffee filters. That means your not drinking any more chlorine or any chemicals that came from the paper. A health benefit. Other then that, for the price of $37, it's a great deal. It makes the best coffee u could possibly make and will save you on beans to pay for itself over time.",

                "review_text": "I had this machine for awhile before I bought my Capresso Classic 18 bar pump machine. (which I really love) For the price, this machine is really quite good. It makes lattes that are even better than my current pump machine, which I paid nearly $200 for. (Probably because I haven't mastered the technique of making the latte with the smaller shots of real espresso from the pump machine). This espresso machine puts out a good deal of strong coffee. It is not technically espresso, which requires higher pressure than a steam powered machine can muster. So I agree with the reviewer who says that if you're looking only for espresso shots, you don't want to go with this machine. It will not give you that amazing taste that comes only from a proper shot of espresso pulled from a pump machine that is at much higher pressure. But if you're looking for a machine only for lattes, cappuccinos, and other such drinks, this is definitely worth the money. (Currently $29! What a deal!) I give it 4 stars not because it is 4 stars when considered beside other espresso machines in the market. My standard, rather, is that it is an amazing purchase for the price and will definitely fill the craving for those who are putting all the money into Starbucks and want to cut back on this costly, overpriced habit. I recommend also investing in a 6 pack of Torani chocolate syrup, which is what you need to make a delicious mocha latte. You can also get it in other flavors. This machine will also be more than sufficient to make a frappuccino. What I do with frapps is to freeze the espresso, put a little more ice in the blender with the frozen espresso (you may not even need more ice given how much \"espresso\" is produced with this machine which, as I said, is far more than with a pump machine), some milk, and then some Torani syrup. You will be making frapps and lattes that rival Starbucks with this machine (and a little practice).",

So, NOTHING is more important to me first thing in the morning than getting a quick, easy, perfect cappuccino. Seriously. Nothing. When my third Krupp's espresso machine died after years of heavy use, I decided to change things up. I bought a Mr. Coffee ECM160 4-cup Steam Espresso Machine and at the same time, bought a Capresso espresso machine. This way, we have one at home and one in our RV. I chose the Capresso because I ADORE another product from Capresso: Mllk Froth Pro (You simply pour the milk into the non-stick, easy-clean pitcher, and press start. It's perfect every time and frees me up to feed the cats while the espresso and milk froth are in the making.) I chose the Mr. Coffee simply because it was the maker of my first drip coffee machine which lasted for decades. It's a name I know and trust. Even tho the Capresso was $10-15 more expensive, the Mr. Coffee choice is by far the best. It takes up less space on the counter and less space vertically. Its lid is crazy easy to open and close in a hurry, while the Capresso lid lacks grooves, so it's extremely difficult to open and close (it requires rubber gloves, someone who's very strong, and has lotsa patience to wrestle with it every morning in order to finally twist it on and off). In addition, the Mr. Coffee brews faster than the Capresso espresso machine, finishing at the exact same time as the Capresso Milk Froth Pro! Ahhhhhhhhh. Perfect every time. Amazingly easy. The Mr. Coffee espresso machine + Capresso Milk Froth Pro are a match made in heaven & absolute staples in our kitchen! =^.^=",

But as other reviewers point out, the side knob handle broke off after 2 years of regular use (less than once per day), just like a time bomb. I wasted 2 units in the last 4 years with the same problem and just ordered another. While all other parts seem in good condition, the manufacturer should use better material for the knob pole instead of poor plastic, or make it replaceable, to extend its life. The newly ordered unit is slightly different from previous 2 and looks cheaper. I wonder if it would last any longer? Otherwise, great little coffee maker, tucked nicely under the cabinets.",

I bought this one when the other one finally gave out, which I thought was a great idea considering the low price and how long the old device lasted. When the new one came, it worked beautifully, but it left a horrible plastic smell that lingered in our kitchen all day. I rinsed it with vinegar, etc., and the smell, after a week of use twice a day, still is just as strong and horrible. I called Mr. Coffee, and they were very polite and helpful, said they had heard of this problem before and said they would replace it. They sent the order through, but it hasn't been shipped yet. I called today, and the representative was not nearly as nice as the first representative, and said he had no idea when it would ship. Meanwhile, I am going back to \"cowboy coffee\" while we wait (and wait and wait) for our new coffee machine. Apparently when these work, they work wonderfully, but when they don't, it's awful. The smell makes me want to gag and I'm sure it can't be good for you to drink the coffee that comes out of this pot. If the replacement espresso machine comes in timely manner and doesn't smell and works properly, I will update this review, but for right now, I'm disgusted. UPDATE: I finally received the replacement coffeemaker over two weeks after I ordered it, arriving two days later than they promised me after I called, but it did arrive. The new one has a very slight smell similar to the other one, but just barely there. It works great, and for the price, you can't beat these little coffee makers (as long as you don't get one that smells).",

Finally the new one gave out completely and we were not happy! 6 months was all we got out of it and it was not cheap.

There's a bit of a learning curve here. The Melita machine was pump driven, Mr. Coffee's is steam driven. I didn't realize this when I bought it. (I'm not sure I would've understood the difference) The first time I used it, I blew milk all over the place....the coffee was good, tho. I fiddled with it for a day or two and stopped hating it rather quickly. I foam into a receptacle that is wider on the bottom to help contain the bubbling. I love that you can make 4 shots worth of really, really good espresso at a time. I love the steam-driven foamer, which makes the milk very hot and nicely foamed. I really love this little machine...it has a small footprint and makes really, really good espresso. I love the lattes made with it, as well. I'm happy with it and will get another as back-up.",

You can't really avoid this either since the steamer doesn't have real settings. Just on and off. In the picture, it shows the steamer sticking out making it look easy to access and use but it only sticks out a little bit and can't get into very deep cups. It's perfectly fine in that sense if you're using an actual steaming cup but I using use my coffee cups. As for the coffee, you need more coffee grounds in ratio to water than it states in the instructions for you're just getting strong coffee, not an espresso shot. All in all, it's not a bad price for what you get. It suites my purposes just fine and I like using it. The end result if done right is very delicious.",

Here is my routine - I hope it helps someone out! 1. Fold a paper towel and put it on the counter. Take the small espresso basket out of the holder and put it on the paper towel. Fill with desired amount of espresso, and tamp - not too hard! (ps., do you have a Misto olive oil sprayer? Turn it upside down and use that to tamp. Your welcome. :p) Make sure the edges are clean and place in the holder. Use paper towel to wipe tamp-er. Lock the holder into the espresso machine. 2. Using glass carafe, fill espresso machine with desired amount of water. (I generally make a latte, so I fill it with enough to make the espresso and steam too!) Put the lid on the carafe and slide into place. Do not screw the top on yet!! 3. Plug in the espresso machine *with the screw-top off* and turn to 'brew'. If you're steaming milk, take out the milk and pour into steaming cup. Set on the counter. 4. Once the water starts to make noise and is about to be or already boiling, quickly screw the top into place. This method ensures that no yucky warm water filters through the espresso and weakens it/changes the flavor. Since this little guy just works off of steam pressure, screwing the cap on when the steam really starts is the best way to avoid this. Be a bit careful, by the way. 5. While the espresso is brewing, I like to put my sugar in the mug beforehand. Remember that paper towel? Wet it. Once the espresso starts to change color or the machine makes a slightly different noise, get your milk ready, stick the nozzle in, and steam. I won't go into the method... You'll figure out what works for you! Once you're done steaming, use the wet paper towel to immediately wipe down the steam nozzle. 6. Pour your espresso into the mug, followed by your milk/foam. Fill the milk steaming cup with water and re-insert the nozzle. I rest the cup on top of another upside down mug so that I don't have to hold it. Now unplug the machine, turn the nozzle to steam, and let the rest of the steam out into the water. This will release the pressure as well as cleaning the nozzle! Enjoy! My only complaint about this machine is the position of the steaming nozzle. It is way to close to the body and not at all adjustable. Otherwise, it's a pretty good solution!",

                "review_text": "My Kyrups 963A finally died after 21 years of daily, sometimes twice daily use. While I took good care of it and had to improvise when parts broke, the steam cap finally gave out. The plastic just crumbled. I lived in Italy for a year and know good espresso. The 963A was not a true espresso machine, however, I wasn't and probably never will be ready to drop big bucks (i.e., hundreds) just so that I can get espresso froth. I can get good espresso with good beans. That's the key. I need strong coffee and caffeine! :-) So, I turned to the Mr. Coffee ECM160 4-Cup Steam Espresso Machine. It's a backward engineered version of my former Kyrups 963A. I can use the 963A's carafes and lids. After running a few carafes of water through to clean it, the first batch was good. I like this machine... but I would not bother with black frother attachment which is suppose to help. On both the 963A and the ECM160, you'll have better control of frothing cream/milk without the attachments. Use the metal tip alone like I have for the last 21 years and you'll find it flexible, easy to control and fun at times improvising. I might rate this a 5 star in 3-5 years... if it makes it that long. Some parts are as robust as the 963A. However for 40 dollars, you get what you pay for... and I got something that's worth that amount of money. Time will tell on this one... My 963A was a 5star+, rest its dear soul.",

When we first got it, I will say that I was a little disappointed, but I played around with it, and I've worked out some of the quirks, and it's actually quite a great little machine. First tip: Fill the carafe to the top of the metal line to get the amount of steam you need to froth your milk. Second: Invest in a good tamper. The measuring cup isn't great. Third: Take the guard off of the steaming arm. This machine actually produces an impressive amount of crema despite the fact that it's not a pump machine. It beats Starbucks in our book!

I have been using this machine consistently for about a month. -- DETAILS: I purchased this machine because years of experience with products in general has taught me that one should go cheap on the first go and then when one has some level of expertise with the medium (be it coffee or cooking or computers or musical instruments)--THEN go spend the \"bigger bucks\" for something which you can utilize with some acumen. The first few times you will probably fail to tamp right and get either a too-bitter slow brew or a too-weak fast brew; but if you're that skilled as a barrista you wouldn't be mucking about with this type of machine anyway! The build quality seems acceptable for what is a truly entry-level device. The carafe, however, seemed frail even when I first handled it; and the frailty was proven when the other day it fell a few inches and shattered on a granite surface. Luckily I have thick-bottomed glass tumblers which serve as an adequate stand-in; measuring water by eye is easy enough anyway. -- PROS: * CHEAP. * Quick and easy setup (3-5 minutes to create a latte; parts are pretty idiot-proof in handling). * Easy cleanup (all parts removable, and the wand is easily wiped clean with a coarse brush when the plastic sleeve is removed. CONS: * Treat gently as the parts are as fragile as the price suggests! -- CONCLUSION: Definitely worth it as a \"my first espresso machine\" as at this price point you really can't go wrong and it's too simple to screw up too easily. ********** EDIT ********** I've upped it a star. Why? I have finally mastered the frothing procedure properly. Turns out you should just keep frothing the milk, keep frothing, keep frothing... THEN it will be \"proper\". I've removed all my \"novice error\" complaints. One star off still for the cheap carafe. ********** EDIT #2 ********** Keeping it at 4/5 stars even tho this one got consigned to the rubbish bin (lost the attachment for the wand) as I learnt something quite useful for frothing: 1) Buy a proper metal pitcher (12oz will do). 2) CHILL IT. 3) When frothing a chilled pitcher will allow the milk to froth properly!",

Pros: Brews quick, tastes fine, does the job. Cons: The steamer arm is a little short and when you're steaming in a mug you (at least, I) tend to bump the cup against the side of the machine, which leads to little spills every now and again. It also brews so quick that you have to keep an eye on it, to make sure it doesn't overflow. But really the cons are minimal and this is exactly what I needed. Cappuccinos for everyone!",

Id recommend Pilon or Cafe Bustelo coffees. This machine allows me to recreate this type of espresso and make it well. I am not so much interested in the cappuccino milk frothing arm but have used it to some success. Id say that if you are are cappuccino drinker, you may be better off going with something a little nicer, but this guy does the trick to make good espresso and its cheap. I am very happy with this product. The one thing I will say is that make sure you know what 4-cup means because 4 cups(2 shots) is essentially what I drink at one time.

It's similar, or stronger, than what you can achieve with an Aeropress. I first tested with an espresso grind, 18 grams (2 scoops), tamped. The machine just couldn't force the water through the grounds. The safety steam vent spewed, but no coffee came out. I went down to medium grind, 18 grams (2 scoops) tamped. This made strong coffee, about 45 ml extract in 35 seconds' time. Remember: at least 75% of the coffee drink quality comes from your BEANS and WATER. I tested with excellent CounterCulture.com beans. Four stars because: -- Steamer works well -- Portafilter and steam boiler can achieve strong coffee -- Steam wand does not articulate -- What's this giant pot for?

I love my Mocha in the morning (especially when winter comes around), and I was not happy when my previous espresso machine died (especially since it was a high quality machine). I bought this one as something to tide me over until I got around to buying a better one, but I now suspect that this will last me for some time. This makes a good espresso, and it is super easy to use. Having the one switch that converts between espresso and steamer functionality makes it nice and easy. The beaker to hold the espresso means you don't have to try and line up espresso shot glasses, and the markings on the beaker make it easy to see how much you are getting. On the negative side of things, this is a case where you get what you pay for - at the cheap price, do not expect the moon. There is no crema evident, however if you are making a Latte or a Mocha or ... do you really care? I am grinding my beans fresh before making the espresso, and using a fine grain, with a medium tamp down. So I would have expected at least a little crema. The beaker has a marking at the equivalent of a double shot, however it is not marked as that. Twice that marking is marked as 2 cups, and the next marking is 4 cups. However if you do make that much coffee, expect it to be fairly diluted - to be fair, I would expect any espresso machine to make diluted coffee if you make 8 shots from a single basket of ground coffee. The beaker also contains a lid that makes it easy to center the beaker below the nozzle, however I am not sure that this is needed. The lid (if put on correctly) results in the coffee markings being off-center. Hardly a big deal. This machine does not have a water reservoir, and I have mixed feelings about this. My (far more) expensive machine had one, and that meant I would only fill up with filtered water once a week, or could fill up on the fly if we drank more coffee than normal. However this machine requires a refill of water each brew, and it is important to ensure that the pressure has been released before taking the cap off totally - fortunately the cap seems to have been designed so that it starts releasing pressure long before you could possibly get the cap off. While I have put everything through the dishwasher, the shiny metallic sheen on the holder for the coffee basket is paint on top of a not-so-shiny metal, and that paint does not survive the dishwasher. Do not expect it to be shiny afterwards. :-) While it seems that I have posted a fair few negative comments, every single one of them is extremely minor nit-picking. At the end of the day, it is the espresso itself that matters, and this makes a good brew.",

Just type \"Make cheap Mocha with a $30 Espresso Machine ECM250\". I read through the instructions and gave her a try for the first time jamming the steam wand down into a coffee mug of milk. Wow, haha - like some buyer mentioned in here about getting nothing but boiling milk was a true enough statement and burned myself along the way, my hands and fingers were splattered with boiling milk all over the place! Keep in mind, I've NEVER done this or even seen someone do it. Oh, and taking off the top without depressurizing it when I shouldn't was another learning curve, it burned my fingers AGAIN. Anyways, I couldn't get the micro-foam until I did some research and watched several videos on You Tube about how to do it. So, I tossed and turned about this my first night of ownership and woke with determination! Oh... did I earn some kisses from my bride when she was licking the spoon from a cup of Micro-Foam, and yes, from 2% milk, not whole milk as was mentioned in many of the videos to use. Micro-Foam: I had ordered the 20oz Stainless Steel Frothing cup with a Temperature Gauge and proceeded to make it happen! Like me, if you don't know how to do this, you need a temp gauge. But, using a cold cup with cold milk about 10oz, half the container inserting the steaming wand all the way down and let it set, gently moving the cup up and down. When bubbles start, just put the wand in as deep as it will go. The steam wand IS short and close to the sides of the machine, but making do and using all my senses began to notice when the milk hits about 90 degrees a sweet spot begins form (funny sounding noise) that can be massaged until the temp hits 155 degrees tops. IMMEDIATELY take the brown wand extension off and drop it into some water, wipe the wand with a wet towel. Tap the mug on the counter if any large bubbles are present and whirl the frothing cup. Espresso: I need some better grounds than pre-ground stuff. \"Pending\"",

Could this really do the job more expensive espresso makers would do? YES! I love this little machine! I did what other reviews had suggested and followed the directions to the letter. They are straightforward and following them ensured wonderful coffee from the very start (OK, maybe my very first attempt wasn't perfect - I didn't steam the milk enough but since then every cup has been great). I don't know why you'd want to buy a more expensive machine when this one does the job very well in my opinion. Perhaps my only gripe would be the lack of tamper (the back of the coffee scoop is supposed to serve as a tamper but does not do it very well) and lack of frothing jug, but this can be easily rectified by buying your own.",

Both 1% and 2% milk work very well with equal success, and I don't bother using the frothing aid. But I always chill the stainless steel pitcher before adding cold milk and starting the frothing process. This appliance maker would do well to re-engineer the oddly shaped, texture-less water reservoir cap and control knob. I also agree with others about the too-short electrical cord (yes, it's completely unwrapped).",

                "review_text": "This is a good machine for beginners and people who aren't gourmet critics about their coffee. It gets the job done and makes it fairly simple to brew espresso. I have only brewed \"2 cups\" at a time and not attempted 4 yet, but I've consistently gotten a well-balanced brew with a nice crema. Although a devoted coffee snob could find criticisms your average Starbucks drinker should be satisfied. As others have noted you should buy a frothing pitcher if you don't already have one, as this machine doesn't come with one. Don't get one too large or the steam wand won't reach deep enough (see below). The main weaknesses are related to the steaming function, and each can be resolved with a work-around: 1) The steam wand is just a bit short, meaning even with a relatively small 12-oz frothing pitcher the wand can't quite get as low as you may want because the rim of the pitcher will be bumping up into the arm of the wand. You can compensate some by tilting the pitcher to make the milk deeper at one end. 2) The wand is also positioned directly up and down with no tilting possible, which makes it difficult to get the necessary angle to get the milk rolling--though after some practice I was able to achieve rolling milk by tilting the pitcher towards myself (front) and keeping the wand on the left side (machine side) of the pitcher. Although the manual instructs you to move the wand around, being able to get the milk rolling without moving the wand around is critical to creating the velvety microfoam that is the difference between a great latt\u00e9 or mocha and an OK one. 3) The steam wand also came with a \"frothing aid\" - a plastic cover with additional holes in it. I guess this is supposed to be helpful, but for my part I was unable to produce microfoam until I removed the frothing aid and just used the naked wand. 4) You can't easily steam without brewing espresso first (ex: to steam some milk for a child's hot cocoa, sans espresso), because the brewing process is needed to heat up the water for a few minutes to build up the steam heat and pressure. If you try to turn the steam function on without brewing first, the heating element comes on but you don't achieve enough pressure because the steam valve is open. If you try to run the brew function without coffee in the filter, the water floods through much faster and you end up trying to steam without enough pressure because the the water isn't hot enough yet, or you run out of steam very quickly because so much of the water ended up in the carafe instead of coming out as steam. Thus, the only way to steam without brewing first is to add a full carafe of water to the machine, set to brew, and let the carafe fill up to the 4-cup mark before switching over to steam.",

I am probably at over 300 uses on this thing now - I have descaled it twice and it doesn't seem like it will give up any time now. Strangely, the glass cup is more likely to need replacing before the machine, as the metal got loose around the grip. That is the only mild problem I have had.",

I can now make hot mocha latte's comparable to the dunkin donuts ones (almost as good as paneras). I did buy a tamper to pack down the coffee grinds. At first it's a little confusing (directions are bad) - on how to use the frother. Here's what I do...fill the water up to the 2cup mark and then a little more water (this is what you'll use to steam). Turn to brew, when once espresso hits the 2cup mark on pot, switch it to off. Then get your milk cup ready to froth and turn the dial to steam. Problem is you never know how much extra water to add to get the right amount of steam. I also think it's a pain to clean up the frother. So here's what I do to make a delicious hot mocha latte: 1. fill pot up to 2cup mark with water, pour in water reservoir 2. use tamper to pack down ground espresso beans (lavazza is good, 6.99/can at grocery store) 3. turn to brew 4. meanwhile, heat my milk in coffee mug (2/3 full in 16oz cup) - in microwave about 1:45/2min. 5. add a teaspoon of davinci chocolate sugar free syrup (or similar, like torani) to my hot milk cup 6. then pour in espresso and stir YUM! Whole thing takes about 4 min and clean up is a breeze. Much better than spending 2.64 a day at dunkin donuts. I highly recommend this affordable espresso maker!",

The soy milk foams nicely and the machine heats up and works quickly compared to others I've owned. Make sure you are cleaning the steam wand (water submersion and blow-out) every use or it will clog up.",

We took the plunge and I'm happy we did. This little thing has turned out to be fantastic! I don't know how we lived with out it. We have owned this product for nearly 6 months and here are my tips: 1- Buy the temper so you can pack the espresso bean 2- the pitcher is worth buying but isn't totally necessary (you can use a coffee mug if you really wanted to, the pitcher is more convenient) 3- clean the maker every time you use it, but it is especially important to clean the milk steamer every time you use it because you can get build-up (you would have to do this with every espresso maker) 4- Give the maker a really good clean about every week. I put water through it a few times, it doesn't take long. 5- make sure you use all the water every time you use it 6- don't over-fill anything Don't be alarmed! These tasks are typical up-keep for any espresso maker. Believe me, the little extra work is worth it since you can get up every morning to a latte or cappuccino without paying the crazy prices at a coffee shop. p.s. My friend has this same espresso maker and she has had it for over three years without any problems =)",

                "review_text": "I really wanted to get into making espresso at home as I always found myself going to Starbucks or other local coffee places multiple times every week. I investigated buying an Illy Pod machine, however when I went to visit a friend in L.A. she has this exact machine and made me some espresso and it was wonderful. So instead of spending $150+ on a pod machine or a super fancy machine I decided to give this little guy a chance since she loved hers so much. I am glad I did an I will tell you why: Design: This is a really nicely designed espresso machine, it is small, simple, and overall looks nice sitting on the counter. It isn't fancy as it just has a turn nob to make espresso or use the steamer. The top of the machine can be used to hold anything, I put a few small espresso cups on top and it looks nice. Ease of use: It really doesn't get any easier than this to make espresso. Simply fill the water up to the 2 or 4 (cup) line and pour into the top, and pack the espresso into the holder up to 2 or 4. The espresso holder simply lifts and locks into place. Turn the nob and it will start brewing, and once you no longer see espresso coming out you can turn it off. Espresso: I have used Fresh & Easy Espresso and also Lavazza espresso and it tastes great with this machine. I mix mine with a bit of soy half and half and I am good to go, or throw hot water in for an americano. Many people rate the espresso machine based on it's ability to make that nice froth on top of the espresso and you will see a bit here when you make the coffee. It is complete steam based system and it seems to work fairly well. The froth on top of the espresso isn't extremely thick and I am assuming higher end machines will do this better. I will say that once I bought a Tamper to pack down the espresso it helped a lot, so invest another $6 or so to get one of these and it will make a pretty decent difference, if not just for the ease of use. Frother: On the side of the machine is a milk frother/steamer. I didn't read the directions so I honestly didn't know how to use it until my friend from L.A. came to visit. All you have to do is add water to the little steam icon on the cup and pour it into the machine. Then turn it on and give it a minute. The steam is hot and pretty intense. It actually does a nice job of frothing milk or soy as long as you figure out how to use it. TIP: I like to turn the machine onto Brew after I am done frothing as there might be some water left over. Summary: This machine by far is the best bang for the buck. I have had it for around 2 months, and my friend has had it for a year and it is great. I still occasionally go to Starbucks, but it is great to just have it available right in my house. For $30 definitely give this little guy a try.",

I Don't use the Krups cup they suggested you buy with (I bought it, before I knew better). I have a large heavy glass mug I use and like it better. No pouring from one thing to another, I just scrap off excess foam and add the coffee..DONE Glad I didn't pay for the expensive machine when this one does the job for me. The only part I don't really like on this model is the steam tube in towards the back of the machine and you have to turn the whole body to use.",

Originally, we had paid $50 for the Krups. Paying over $100 for a new machine seemed ridiculous, and this Mr. Coffee seemed like the best compromise, especially since we could use the glass carafe from the old machine if we would break the new one. Lo and behold, when it arrived, the construction is exactly the same as the Krups with a few minor improvements in the knobs, the shell, etc. The boiler cap is 1/16\" smaller in diameter, that's the only real difference. So we trust this machine will keep us in strong coffee and foamed milk for many more years. We were also very surprised and pleased with how quickly it was delivered, just two days even though we had selected the free shipping option. Of course, being in the next state from the warehouse may have had something to do with that. Two caveats: the plastic air siphon on the steamer wand is overkill, get rid of it, and the instructions fail to note that you must unplug the machine before releasing the pressure through the steamer wand.",

Even if you had to replace it after a year it would still be worth 40$ My parents have paid for espresso makers 4 times more then this and had nothing but problems.

One tip I followed was to purchase a stainless still pitcher to use with the frother. It was amazing the difference in the amount of froth. That being said, I discovered just using the stainless steel pitcher with a battery operated handheld frother that I already had, also produced amazing froth. So if I had to do over again, I probably would not buy the machine, and just use the handheld frother with the stainless steel pitcher, adding the froth to my coffee. I did not purchase the machine so much for espresso coffee, but for the latte feature. With my regular Mr. Coffee machine, I can make a pot of coffee and let it warm for a couple of hours without tending to it. With this espresso machine, you make a cup or 2 at a time, and drink immediately. But, it does make a nice strong espresso coffee, if that is what you are mostly interested in. As for delivery, Amazon proved once again to be quick and efficient.",

I fill the pitcher up just about 1/2 way and when I steam the milk, I get so much froth it almost overflows! The key to small frothy bubbles is to keep the steam handle fully emersed in the milk. To have enough steam you need to add about 2 to 3 ounces extra water to the water reservoir (if making 4 cups I usually fill the espresso pitcher to the top of the metal band). When the espresso has brewed the requested # of cups simply switch the power to steam from brew (less mess if the frothing arm is in the pitcher ready to go when you do this). If you follow the directions, clean after each use (Especially the frothing arm...immerse in water and run a small steam cycle after each use and scrub with a scrubbing sponge), and this will be a great addition to your kitchen for a long time! We are hooked. My husband is already talking about getting rid of the coffee maker! Love it!!!",

Frothing milk properly for a latte or cappuccino requires more than just blowing a little compressed hot air into the milk. The good news is that the frother setting isn't useless, it makes an important pressure release valve so you can safely turn it off and unscrew the lid after you've unplugged it and used the frother to expel all the excess pressure, avoiding steam burns. Over all, I gave this espresso maker a 5 because for its price, it's hard to find a comparable espresso maker. It makes good espresso, and that's all it does. The fact that it only makes espresso is actually a plus in my book, complicated latte and cappuccino makers with internal milk bags and creamer are a huge pain to clean and always get clogged. This espresso maker has simple cleaning instructions, and only requires a full cleaning about every other month, and it's fairly simple to do. It's a good simple, durable, easy to clean espresso maker and I love it!",

                "review_text": "I would not call myself a true purist of coffee, that being said I am frugal with my money and I do love my espresso so when I say this coffee maker can put out a shot of espresso or more extravagant drink as good if not better than any coffee store that I have been to, I know what it means. It is fairly cheap and it is very easy to use. I have only owned the thing for a week so I cannot speak to durability. I bought this along with a grinder(bur mill cuisinart for $40) and a bag of quality beans all also available here. It produces a wonderful shot and also creates that cappuccino which I crave in the morning. All said this cost just over $100 and within a month and a half it will have paid for itself. The only thing that I would warn about is that this is not turn on and walk away unit. You have to manually turn off the brewing process and you have to clean it yourself instead of Barista at Starbucks which means that all said it will take about 15 minutes in the morning to brew and clean up the machines. That being said the coffee really takes less than 2 minutes to brew the first shot so you can pause it for satisfying the craving and then finish the brew. I do not find this a tremendous imposition and I have fallen in love with the machine. Things to be aware of: - the scoop that comes with can be used as a tamper but it is easier to have a proper tamper to tamp the grinds. It requires about 49mm tamper to cover the filter completely maybe a mm or two more would fit as well. - does not come with a frothing pitcher which is needed for creating a cappucino, latte, etc. -I would recommend reading up on espresso making so that you understand the possible mistakes that can be made(how to store beans, reasons for bur mill over blade grinder and such) -Be careful to unplug the machine and then switch to steam in order to release the pressure so that you do not burn yourself when removing parts for cleaning.",

The only gripe I have is that the reservoir top is an odd shape which makes it tough to screw on and off. I've had this for about 2 months and use it almost daily.

                "review_text": "Update December 2012: When I first purchased this machine, I wasn't very happy with it as my below review reveals. However, since writing it 20 months ago, this espresso machine has provided me with daily lattes despite its issues. I'm revising my rating to give this little workhorse the credit it deserves. It's a great machine for the price, but don't expect years of service or to operate as the specs outline. I've found in the three espresso makers I've purchased, they last between 1-2 years. My current Mr. Coffee ECM160 is on its last legs, as the frother screaches more than froths the milk, even with daily cleaning, but I will be replacing my Mr. Coffee ECM160 with another just like it. Review April 2011: I first purchased a DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker from Amazon about 14 months ago. The machine lasted for about a year and then just stopped working. But, during the time I had it, I became addicted to having a latte every morning, so when it died, I started looking for a replacement. I decided against purchasing another DeLonghi as the prices had increased significantly and it only lasted a year. Based on the reviewer ratings for the Mr. Coffee ECM160 4-Cup Steam Espresso Machine and the price, I decided to give it a try. Since receiving it around 2/25/11, the machine is prone to not brew the coffee and the frother never does the same thing twice. Sometimes when I turn the frother on, the steam starts immediately, other times, I have to wait for a few minutes and then this cannon of steam shoots out and makes a small explosion sound. In addition, sometimes I hear the water boiling for the coffee side of it and other times the water starts pouring as soon as I turn it to brew. It's my own fault for buying cheap chinese goods. I hope to keep you from making the same mistake unless you have money to burn.",

Unless you are willing to spend a grand on a coffee machine - I've found Mr Coffee to be the best coffee machine overall. Here is why: (1) Produces excellent coffee as long as you use the right coffee (2) Never fails - used it for over 3 years now - still working well (3) Excellent for single serve as well as can brew up to 4 cups of coffee. What is not good: (1) Forget about using the steam wand - is useless - it produces so much of water to heat the milk that by the time you have your Latte - it would be watered down heavily. If you are buying this machine exclusively to prepare Lattes & cappuccino and planning to use the steamer - forget about buying this machine. Safety: As a safety precaution - before you open the top lid for water, turn the on-off knob to the steam position to release all the steam and then open the top lid to pour the water in Recommended coffee: (1) If you are tight on budget - try Great Value 100% Arabica or 100% Columbian coffee - for under $3 - it is as good as starbucks or any other premium brand (2) If you are ok to shell out a few $s more - Lavazza Espresso Roast is the best coffee",

Here are a few comments. The machine makes adequate espresso for what it is. You can not expect it to make the same quality drink as a higher brand such as Di Longhi or Saeco. With the coffee dispensing out of a single drip mechanism, it puts the entire shot in a mini coffee pot. The coffee has a descent taste to it, a little bitter due to the shot becoming dead while trying to fill the entire pot. It dispenses with crema(Light colored foamy part of an espresso shot) about half way. The initial trickle drip is slow and dark and starts to foam about after ten seconds. The coffee will get a slight burnt taste if allowed to drip to the full 4 shot mark on the pot. This is due to the steam being fully charged near the end of the dispensing. Once you are done the grounds pop out in a nice packed chunk, My only critique of this type of machine, (not just this brand) is that you can not pre-heat the water. If you wanted to steam the milk first then brew the coffee you can not really do it because there is not enough time to steam the water. You can only brew coffee first, then turn the lever to the steam position to actuate the wand. All in all if you are in a pinch and are looking for a quick disposable machine where you can leave it behind without being without some coin this is a good machine for the money.",

It does, however, produce an excellent, very rich and very dark cup of coffee that you will never get from a drip coffee maker. It is easy to use and the first cup of espresso was excellent. I roast my own coffee beans so while I am not an expert on espresso I do take my coffee drinking seriously. I likely will never use the frothing feature but that doesn't make this machine any less of a bargain. BTW, the tamper sold by Amazon has a 51mm diamter that will work with this machine even though it touches the sides of the basket (but at a level below that used for even one shot). 3 month update: I still believe this espresso maker is an incredible bargain. The only advice I have is use espresso beans and don't use too much ground coffee. Over packing of coffee may or may not shorten the life of the machine but it will definitely produce coffee with a bitter taste. 8 month update: I purchased the De'Longhi EC155 that I now use at home. The steam espresso machine is now in my office. At work I prefer an actual cup of coffee and as noted above it produces a very strong dark coffee of java. Better than any drip coffee machine can. 12 month update: Still working perfectly and producing excellent coffee. I've come to appreciate the espresso made by the De'Longhi with its incredibly thick crema but at work I seem to need a larger cup of java. Two of the three tabs on the coffee pot lid have broken off but the lid stays on when you pour out coffee. I inadvertently left the machine on brew for about an hour when there was no water in it and surprisingly it has continued to work perfectly. This machine may outlast several drip coffee makers I've owned!",

The reason for only 4 stars is the poorly designed cap for the water filler (as well as the oval shaped brew/steam controller on the side). A gecko would be able to turn them just fine, but for normal human fingers, it's nearly impossible to get a grasp on the slippery, sloped top of the cap or the side controller. I suspect Mr. Coffee is following some kind of tradition in designing it that way... I can't think of any other reason, but come on, think outside the box and design a cap that one can properly grasp since it needs to be tightened somewhat so the steam doesn't escape. Other than that, the machine makes great espresso. I tossed the black plastic cover on the frothing wand and the naked, metal wand works just fine.",

There could be knurls or bumps on the steam lid to open if you have slight moist hands. I guess maybe this is a safety feature so people will not open it as often hot like the older style. Dislikes: The plastic top to the glass container is horrible! It will not stay latched in the container and I have to take it off while pouring out my coffee, or I get that in my cup as well. They changed the pour \"tear drop\" on the glass container and it is not as big as the previous model that I had in the combo. It spills out coffee unless you pour it out very slowly. So, you have to pour it into your coffee cup over the sink, not a big deal! Overall, very happy for the price. The size and easy-to-clean bottom catch pan is nice. Would purchase again.",

This product was one of the least expensive espresso machines, but got great reviews so I decided to give it a try. After owning it for about a week I am totally impressed! In addition to the machine, I bought a tamper for about $6, a 20oz steaming picture for about $12, and a Mr. Coffee bean grinder for about $19.00. I bought some espresso beans, vanilla syrup and chocolate sauce from my local grocery store. Overall, I made about a $75 investment. The machine works GREAT! I have managed to make DELICIOUS lattes and mochas that taste just as good as what we were buying at the coffee house. My friends and family have been impressed with my drink creations. This machine and accessories will totally pay for themselves in a couple of months. I can't comment on the durability of the machine since I've only had it for a short while, but even if it dies in a year it would have been completely worth it.",

I read about espresso and its history and all the different types of espresso drinks, and began to really want my own espresso machine, but I didn't want to pay tons of money. Just when it was beginning to look hopeless, I discovered this machine, $40 and great reviews? Well, like so many others here, I just bought it because I figured with the low price and great reviews it was worth the risk. And I must say, this machine works great for my purposes! The drinks I make taste just as good as in any coffee shop I used to frequent, plus I can customize them and experiment however I want - even try weird additions. But in the end, I do keep returning to the basic cappuccino, so delicious in its simplicity. I haven't bought a drink in a coffee shop for so long, now that I have my own espresso machine. I have noticed, however, that if you try to make 4 shots at once then the espresso doesn't turn out so great and you don't really get a good crema on the top. So the only issue I've had with this machine is I try to only make 2 shots at once. But, since I'm really only making these drinks for myself, that's probably a good thing. It also seems to take a long time for the steam to be heated up enough to make espresso and froth some milk, but since this machine only cost me $40 I am not complaining about those nit-picky things.",

This looked like an interesting product since I like using a pressurized coffee maker. This makes a great strong cup of coffee or latte if you like to add milk. The milk steamer is easy to use and allows me to make a latte using home ground Starbucks coffee for a fraction of the price of going to Starbucks. Plus there are no filters to buy or replace so it is ecologically friendly! If you buy it go ahead and get the frothing pitcher and tamper - I ended up buying them after the fact as they are pretty handy.",

The only thing is I don't see how it can make 4 cups (or shots I guess), because I have to fill the esspresso grounds to level 4, to give me 2 cups of perfect made espresso ( I bought a doppio espresso from starbucks with my grounds, came home and then compared my espresso to starbucks, made a few changes and now I can replicate a starbucks doppio). That said, I don't see how you can make 4 cups unless it comes out weaker (even with fine ground beans). Since this is just for me, I don't have to worry about making 4 cups. I wish I bought this sooner, it would have saved me a lot of money and time and I wouldn't be a Gold Member at starbucks lol. If you like simple espresso drinks, buy this.

It takes up very little space on the counter. It is simple and easy to use. As a guy, reading directions is not a big part of things. Even still, it's pretty hard to screw up. The first few times I used it I had some variety in results, but due to getting the perfect grind and tamping and not due to a defect in the machine. The steam powers through my finely ground beans with no problem, and the tamper is just fine. Same with the steamer, it works great. I bought five of these in 2010, four as Christmas gifts and one for myself. Never got a chance to use it as I was soon back overseas. When I came to do this review, I actually thought I had paid $79.95 for it, only to find it was only $39.95. As good as it works, I would have been happy either way. Update; 12/14/12 It's been nearly 7 months since I posted my review. Happy to say after around 600 uses it is still going strong, even though there have been days where I have ran 10 four shot lattes through it. Important: make sure you release the pressure as soon as your done(best to just release any steam left over through the wand) I love mine.",

You cannot steam milk and brew espresso at the same time, as long as you work relatively quickly to assemble your drink, it's not a problem. It does not come with a tamper, but the scoop has a flat bottom that works fine for this purpose, no need to buy a tamper. I would recommend getting a stainless steel frothing pitcher, I tried with a number of pitchers I already owned, and none of them worked as well as the stainless steel version. Although I was never a Starbucks addict, if you are, this machine will pay for itself very quickly. After a couple of practice trials, I made lattes and espressos that taste better than what I can get at Starbucks. It does not take up very much counter space, which is a premium at our house. As long as this lasts a couple years, I don't think you'll regret buying this little guy.",

The only recommendation I can give is: find good ground coffee to brew, this is because all the cappuccino's you are going to be making depend on the quality of this. The machine itself is not to blame. The frother (steamer) works great especially with the 20 oz stainless steel pitcher. This produces more than enough of that lovely foam for one or even two cappuccino's which makes it great (It does take some practice though). A slight detail, this machine doesn't produce good \"crema\" so for all you espresso aficionados I recommend the model above this one. This machine is great to save a few bucks instead of going to the local coffee store and spending 4 bucks or more on a cup of coffee. I would recommend this product to a friend.",

It was OK, but not great. When that wore out we moved up to a Delongi pump model. It was disappointing, very slow, but we used it for a couple of years. The other day, we decide to go back down-scale and purchased this Espresso Machine. We couldn't be happier. We drink lattes, and I think these are at least as good as what we get at either Micky D's or Starbucks. It brews and froths very quickly. I thought about moving up to one the expensive ($500+) automatic Italian machines, but in the end decided to go this way. Even if we have to replace it every couple of years, I think it is still a great deal.",

It really only takes me about 5-7 minutes to grind the beans (by hand!), brew the espresso, steam the milk, and assemble my drink, so it's a time saver, too. I was nervous from some of the other reviews, but it's been working very well for me. I disassemble and clean it after every use, which only takes a minute. It took me a while to learn how to steam the milk properly. I tried it with and without the plastic \"frothing aid,\" or whatever it's called in the description, and I definitely get better results without it. The frothing wand is very short, which means you need to choose your frothing pitcher carefully; I have a 12 oz one that I usually fill with 5-6 oz of milk and it works well. I can submerge the wand, the milk has room to move, and I have enough room to get the amount of foam I like at the end. Great beginner's model!",

We make a full batch of espresso every single morning for homemade lattes with the occasional second round (if we have guests or want an early afternoon bonus latte on the weekends). The device is simple. Because there aren't any fancy options or electronic buttons, there are less possible things that can break on it, which is a plus for me. Since we make two lattes every morning (= 4 shots of espresso total, or one full carafe) I find it more efficient to microwave the milk instead of using the built in steamer/frother. As a former barista, the froth on top was fun, but not worth the effort at home. In the last ten years, we have had to purchase a replacement carafe once because the original was accidentally set down too hard on the counter and shattered. Update 7/11/15: Moving from 5 to 2 stars. The first one we order years ago was WONDERFUL. Unfortunately, when it finally died, the replacement leaked all over. When brewing, water would drip from the top and get all over the counter. Clearly it was defective. We contacted Mr. Coffee directly to let them know about the issue. They rushed a replacement to our house (thanks!) and it worked well at first. After 1-2 months of daily use, this \"leakage\" problem is re-occuring with increasing frequency. While this USED to be a quality-made product that stood the test of time, I'm not going to give them another shot. Sad. Update 6/5/16: Don't buy this. 10 years ago this was an awesome machine. I'm now on #5 because I refused to believe that the quality had dropped that much and I wanted to leverage all of the spare accessories that I'd accumulated. Go with something else. Not only have all of the new ones leaked to varying degrees, but filter holders now are all made of cheaper parts and the handles snap off easily. I was putting up with it, but now they don't make spares of those! RUN!!!",

The body is light and the espresso arm did not snap into place strait, like it was supposed to. It's too tight a fit. Sorta strait was the best we could get it to... Also, the main knob was stiff to turn, making the transition to espresso to steam messy and they CHANGED THE STEAM WAND. Now, this plastic nozzle has holes at the top that forces the user to completely immerse the tip and NOT be able to make foam like a regular barista. It fries the milk and leaves it flat. You should be able to put the tip near the top and pull foam for a latte. With this model, if you do that, it sprays milk all over the place. And the steam wand gave way too much powerful steam and not in a consistent stream, but irregular blasts! It's dangerous, in my opinion and it makes poor quality, bad tasting espresso on top of that. If the steam wand wasn't so horrible, it might have salvaged a 3 star review, but this is so disappointing, I want to return it. I betcha it's made in China, now. It is.",

The Krups machine cost about $200 at Macy's. Anyway, I found this on Amazon for about $35. I figured it should last at least 2 years. I read the reviews about the plastic taste in the coffee. And it is true, after 6 months it is finally going away. However, after about 6 months of use the plastic knob to switch from brew to steam twisted off completely. Now it is stuck n brew. I will not be purchasing this again. I will probably purchase a Krups.",

I was a bit disappointed because I was expecting the steamer to work on a brand new product. I then used the coffee machine several additional times and the coffee started dripping out slower and slower. By the fifth time, the coffee would not brew at all.

I now have a 3rd unit purchased directly from Mr. Coffee and although the water tank has only a slight odor to it (which leaches into the coffee), steam flowing through the steamer stem into the frothing milk tastes as bad as the coffee from the 2nd unit.

The steamer lid is slippery and shaped in a way that makes it hard to lift, a silly poor design. The steamer basket attachment is plastic, not metal, so I don't know if it will last very long. Within a couple of weeks the carafe had a chip/hole in it after coming out of the dishwasher. Not sure if that was our doing, but I have used other carafes for years without issues.",

And with the design issue: the control as well as the water lid both are tapered and so they are both a little difficult to hold and operate. Normally you have some extra protrusions or rings around the edges to hold these well, but Mr. Coffee went the other way - they tapered the end and made it smooth. Mr. Coffee people, if you read this, please fix this design issue. Other thant these 2 issues, I have no issue with this machine.

My DeLonghi broke probably due to me not cleani mg it enough but it was an impressive little guy. But going by the reviews on here I decided to be more frugal and go with a cheaper model. Having been a barista back in college, I am somewhat of an espresso connoisseur. This Mr. Coffee machine does not pull a good creme on the espresso. The coffee is also a bit bitter, even using the same brand as I had used with my DeLonghi. It froths good enough I guess. I also find it inconvenient to have to add more water between the espresso and frothing in order to steam the milk. I wish I had bought another DeLonghi, but I guess I will get used to the Mr. COFFEE.",

I had to unplug it to stop it. To touch it was too dangerous because of the enourmous amount of hot steam that burnt my hand when I tried to turn it off. Amazon was great, told us to dispose of it and sent us another one for free. Again, a major disappointment. The top part was leaking all over (with the first attempts of use), so that in the end not much water would find its way into the carafe.

I don't know if I am using it in a wrong way (probably not), but it is not espresso. What you get is just regular dark coffee. It is not as dark as espresso is supposed to be. So if you make latte or americano, it will be very light. 2. Too much hassle to clean. Every time you brew and steam, you have to unplug the power to release the pressure, put more water to clean any left residue/debri. Well, other than these reasons it is fairly easy to use and super cheap for an \"espresso\" machine. And takes a short time to get your coffee. You get what you pay for.

I followed instructions to clean the machine with water. I did so twice. The drinks were still coming out with the plastic/metallic taste. So I used a vinegar/water combination to clean the machine and ran through at least 3 additional times. Still tasted metallic. Even the steamed milk had a very slight hint of this taste because it is obviously being picked up during the steaming process while the water is in the reservoir. I had difficulty using milk alternatives such as soy milk and could only froth about 1/4-1/3 cup of milk at a time because the steaming is too powerful and bubbles become too big.

                "review_text": "Let me start by saying that I am not a coffee drinker, and much less an espresso drinker. As such, prior to ten days ago, I knew just about nothing regarding espresso machines. However, my daughter's birthday was coming up; and being as she is a former barista who obviously enjoys drinking her espressos, I wanted to give her something nice which I knew she would appreciate. After a fair amount of research on the web -- Wikipedia, Amazon, etc. -- and being as I am an elderly man who lives on a fixed income, I settled for this Mr. Coffee ECM160 4-Cup Steam Espresso Machine. Naturally, my daughter was quite happy to receive this gift from me, and we have both enjoyed a few espressos made with it. However, yesterday, while I was in her kitchen, I noticed that the top of this machine was off. Upon looking in, I was really taken back to discover that the boiler is actually made of aluminum, and not stainless steel. For those of you who are reading this who may be young, the reason for my concern and alarm is that for decades now, a debate has raged regarding the safety of using aluminum in cooking utensils, such as pots and pans. If you conduct your own personal research, you will quickly discover that there is a wide diversity of opinions on both sides of the fence. What is stated as truth and fact depends on who is making the statements: scientists, medical professionals, beverage industry reps, manufacturers of such items as this one, etc. Who you choose to believe is really up to you. Be that as it may, just the fact that high ingestion of aluminum has been potentially linked to maladies such as Alzheimer's Disease, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc., by certain parties, was enough to convince me to abandon aluminum cookware many years ago. Thus, my concern with this espresso machine. If just boiling hot water in an aluminum pot or tea pot results in a small amount of aluminum being dissolved into the liquid, I can only wonder how truly safe it is to boil water under high pressure in an espresso machine which has an aluminum boiler, such as this one. While others may disagree with me -- that is your right -- quite frankly, I feel that listing \"stainless steel\" as one of the selling points for this espresso machine is misleading, deceptive, and borders on false advertising. Yes, some of the outer parts are in fact stainless steel. However, the most important part -- the boiler -- most certainly is not. For those of you who may doubt my words, I got the truth straight out of the horse's mouth; that is, from the Mr. Coffee support team themselves. In the question and answer section of their website at http://www.mrcoffee.com/specialty/mr.-coffee-steam-espresso-and-cappuccino-maker--ecm160-np-/ECM160-NP.html, one person asks: Q: \"Is there any aluminum used in this machine or is it stainless steel?\" A: \"The water boiler portion of the brewer is aluminum. All other metal parts of the brewer are stainless steel.\" Another concerned person asks: Q: \"How much aluminum is leached into the water that I am consuming. Why did they not put stainless steel inside instead?\" A: \"At Jarden Consumer Solutions (JCS), we are committed to producing trusted household products that meet or exceed applicable product standards. All aluminum used in the Mr. Coffee Espresso Maker are recognized as safe for food contact applications by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). JCS purchases aluminum from trusted suppliers, who monitor to ensure what they sell complies with all current federal, state and local health and safety regulations.\" Please notice that Mr. Coffee did not directly answer either of the person's two questions. The bottom line is that you get what you pay for. I bought cheap because that is all my finances allowed, and I am now left disappointed. I love my daughter, and her health is of great concern to me. Thus, I just purchased her another espresso machine which costs five times as much as this one; and yes, it has a stainless steel boiler. In conclusion, if you are ignorant regarding espresso machines as I was, or if you are on a limited budget, you may be happy with this espresso machine. However, if you are concerned for your health, you may want to consider spending more money, and at least getting something that has a stainless steel boiler. PS: Also worthy of note is the following information regarding the Mr. Coffee Espresso Machine which is also found on the Mr. Coffee website: \"The ECM160 espresso maker has a maximum pressure of: 1.24 bar with 14g of coffee powder 3.62 bar with 24g of coffee powder.\" From what I have read online, and based on what my barista daughter told me as well, by any standard, that is TERRIBLE pressure, and will NOT deliver a very strong/concentrated shot of espresso. It is substandard. For a decent shot, your espresso machine should produce at least pressure of 15 bar. Such machines cost at least a few hundred dollars . . . such as the new one that I just purchased for my daughter to replace the Mr. Coffee machine; that is, this one: DeLonghi EC702 15-Bar-Pump Espresso Maker, Stainless",

I don't think you need a tamper for it as I've not noticed difference in taste between the tamped vs. untamped other than espresso shot strength. The frother's arm is quite short and discovered the arm's length to equivalent to that of a Pyrex 1-cup container (if I'm making a single cappuccino); for more beverages the above mentioned frothing pitcher is perfect. I found the small size and appearance of the machine to not go well in a large, high-end kitchen. It looks out of place. The water chamber does get a bit difficult to open if you don't do so immediately after using due to the cap design and the vacuum effect once the water vapor cools down. The machine is light, easy to move and clean. I would recommend this item for anyone that is looking for an inexpensive alternative coffee shops for their morning fix. The machine has more than paid for itself in savings since I purchased it. 12/28/2011 - To release the vacuum in the water chamber and make opening it easier move the knob to the steam setting.

I believe it, since the defective machines sounded like they were on the verge of explosion. They should recall these items - they're useless and dangerous.",

The first machine lasted about two years, which is a lot less than the 10 years a different make/brand (that cost twice as much money) with exactly the same functions lasted before it gradually died. One morning I went to make my usual cup and without any warning - it just didn't work, the water wouldn't heat, nothing. So I purchased this model again because it is easy to use and for my purpose which is making one cup of coffee without any steaming it is fast and no fuss. The cost is reasonable even if I only did get 2 years out of it. I did not use the steaming function or wand at all so I cannot review those functions. If this machine lasts substantially longer than 2 years, I might change my rating which is average at this point. It is what I would expect for the price but I thought I would get at least 5 years from the machine, hence only 3 stars.",

Everything is now cheap and flimsy from the decanter handle to the milk frother. Overall, functionally it works the same as the first generation. The performance at least has not suffered. It works ok. The first generation I bought for <30 and was a far better deal. The only improvement to this model is the power indictor (which the previous model did not have). Update: After 9 months of once a day use, it exploded like everyone else's. Coffee grounds and a mess everywhere. Looking at the filter basket locking mechanism, it's pushed out. I imagine that the constant pressure of pushing hot water thru the filter basket stressed this area to failure. It's plastic..I don't see it as a if it is going to fail but when IMO.

I bought a 3rd one for my regular home when my Braun finally went after 20+ years (but before the metal strap on 2nd one broke, so I didn't have the full picture yet).

What we found disappointing was that the milk remained cold or lukewarm. The small amount of pressurized steam is not enough to increase the milk temperature to 150 degrees, what the manual claims. We used only a small amount of milk (about 2-3 oz.) straight from the refrigerator and after frothing stopped (and the foam disappeared), the milk temperature was about 80 degrees F. or less.

The price was good for this sturdy little machine; it doesn't take up much room on the counter, and the flat top is ideal to store things. I experimented only twice with the amount of coffee required to make a (very) tasty cup; experimenting is necessary due to personal liking, and grind and type of coffee. The machine is quiet and fast. The more I use it, the more I like it. There are some cons, for me anyway. The screw-on cap for the water reservoir is nice to look at, but is totally non-ergonomically shaped. It's almost impossible to get a good grip on it because of its sloped sides and smooth texture. The handle on the side to turn for \"Steam\" or \"Brew\" is very similar and difficult to use. I don't like these at all. I also don't like the lag time between cups because you have to wait awhile for the pressure inside the machine to drop before unscrewing the awkward cap. And super-lefties beware: the carafe MUST be poured with the right hand because of the placement of the little \"V\" in the carafe where the coffee is diverted to flow into a cup. I'm an ambidextrous lefty so it's not a problem, but the first time I tried to pour using my left hand, I saw this could be an issue for lefties. All in all, I'm satisfied. I hope it lasts for awhile.",

I thought this was ok as I made coffee more than once a day for the four years and no problems. This new Coffee make looks like the old one but it is not the same. It is not as sturdy as the old one. Now for the really bad part. My wife was making a cup of coffee one morning and she left the room for a minute when all of a sudden the cup that holds the grounds explodes off the maker splashing HOT coffee and grounds all over the kitchen. We just assumed she did not get the grounds cup secured and we were careful from then on. Now just the other day I was making a cup of coffee being careful to get the grounds cup tight. I was in the kitchen when the coffee maker started spewing steam from around the grounds cup and I ran out of the kitchen just as the grounds cup exploded off the unit again dousing thew kitchen in hot coffee and grounds. I am afraid to use this coffee maker now and will most likely destroy it and put it in the trash. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COFFEE MAKER!!",

I tried adding water after seeing the frothing unsuccessful and maybe because it didn't get \"boiled\" from the brewing step, the water doesn't produce any steam to froth the milk. The frothing aide is also a bit short. I bought two frothing pitchers for this machine (12 & 20 oz) and tried the 20 oz first and there is no way the wand would be even half way...I'll try again with the 12 oz, but I'm unsure that'll be successful too. As an espresso/cappuccino maker, it's fast and brews quite well...the newer generation may have a better wand if frothing milk is a must!",

                "review_text": "So after opening this, I expected to have to clean it, but I didn't expect it to have as much trash and manufacturing byproduct in it as I did. The first time I steamed milk, it tasted like licking a circuit board (semi-expected) so I figured after running a bunch of steam through it it would go away. However, much to my dismay, I looked in the cup I used to catch the steam and water that was shooting out and there were metal and plastic particles in the water! I was absolutely shocked. So I ran more steam through it (filling it up to it's max with water and letting it all go through the steamer) probably at least 6 times, and each time metal and plastic came out. When I finally stopped getting particles out of the steamer, I tried to steam milk again, and it still tasted like circuit board. I thought it would've been well clean by now, but it wasn't. Then I switched over to the espresso side to see what would happen, and when the water came out I found a white flaky substance in the water. Again, horrified, I decided to clean it, only this time I stepped up my game and used part for part vinegar and water. I let it go through the steamer about 3 times, and the espresso part 3 times (both times using the entire tank for each cleaning). Then, and ONLY then, did I stop seeing mysterious particles in the water and the coffee/milk started tasting like it should. I was shocked it wasn't more clean than it was. Seriously, I probably could have sued them had I documented all of the contaminants I found in the water after cleaning it so much. That aside, as an espresso machine for a novice barista, it works well. Easy to use, easy to clean, steams milk well, brews espresso well. No bells and whistles, but it fits my needs and makes a good latte once you get the hang of it. Decently priced, so that always helps. But please, please clean it extremely thoroughly before you use it. Hopefully you won't have as much trash and residue in yours as I did mine, but if you get rid of it by cleaning it well it works fine.",

Simple engineering will tell you that this means that the water chamber and the threaded opening are expanding during the heating process and not retracting/contracting once cooled. Eventually there will be a complete loss of vacuum which will render the unit useless. I would not recommend this item.",

The Bella machine lasted over 5 years and only quit working after I forgot to turn it off for 24 hours. The Mr. Coffee unit was slightly more expensive, but I do not like the milk steamer at all. I make a mess every time and can not get a good froth to milk. I like the compact size of this type of machine and will be going back to the Bella brand.",

                "review_text": "UPDATE ON 14 MAR 10: Well I originally had nothing but praise for this machine in the first month of operation but after that I became sorely disappointed with it. The frothing arm is too easily blocked. I clean the chamber and frothing arm regularly but it seems that after a few weeks, it simply won't steam anymore. Additionally, before it stopped steaming altogether, the blockage would cause what I considered to be a significant safety hazard. The machine would not steam, but then eventually explode spewing steam and espresso all over the kitchen. I still use this machine when I want a Cafe Americano or just espresso shots but I definitely regret buying it as I can no longer steam milk or do anything else fancy. ORIGINAL REVIEW: First I'll preface my review by saying that while I like espresso drinks, I'm NOT a hardcore coffee snob. On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being \"I only drink hot chocolate\" and 10 being \"I only drink the finest coffees straight from Columbia,\" I'm probably about a 7. So when I decided to give my coffee maker a break and mix things up a bit, I was pretty intimidated seeing espresso machines running upward of $300. Clearly I was not in the market for something that expensive but I also didn't want something so cheap and worthless that I would never use it. This thing is a home run. It's easy to use, reasonably stylish, works great, and is priced just right. Although the process of making espresso drinks is much more involved than making a pot of coffee, I find myself going the extra mile often because the flavor is just so much more pronounced. I really can make drinks on par with the local coffee shop for what seems like pennies (espresso uses fewer beans than a pot of coffee too)! You probably will need some practice to get the process down and find out how best to set up the machine for what you're trying to make (i.e., figuring out how much water you'll need to still have steam available after the espresso is brewed) but after that, it works great. I fully recommend this product and do yourself a favor and get a frothing pitcher, thermometer, and tamper to make it as smooth as possible.",

It also kept putting these white chips of something in the coffee as water passed through the filter. I had to brew about 30 cups to make this stop. MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS FIRST. Also, the frother has a plastic cover over the metal piece. Just cleaning the outside will not work. You have to make sure you take the plastic piece off to clean the milk from the metal pipe. This is a HUGE design flaw. And finally, the machine cannot brew and froth at the same time and there is not regulator for either. It either all ON or all OFF.

This is the perfect little machine for that. It gets the job done! With that said, I had this for about a week working perfectly until one day I went to froth the milk and noticed, half my milk was missing out of the carafe. Early morning me thought I was going insane. Where could the milk have gone? I thought maybe I had just not put as much milk in as I thought, looked everywhere in case I had a small stroke and poured it out somewhere random. Checked the condensation line on the carafe and I had indeed had more milk in there. Open the water reservoir on the machine and there was my milk. It had inverted pressure and sucked it back up into the maker. I have read a good majority of the reviews on the product and never saw that mentioned, so I am hoping it was just a freak thing. Packed it back up, sent it back to amazon who sent me a new one and have it up and running fine. If this new one works out well I will come back and give more stars, but until it proves its worth, it only gets 3 stars. Update- I have had my replacement maker for a few weeks now. I have to say I kind of miss the old one. The frother on this machine isn't as consistent with heating as the last one, however, this one also hasn't inverted milk. I just opt to only use the espresso maker and nuke my milk in the microwave (I know, sacrilege). Cheap machine. If you want more, then pay more on something different.",

A few months in, the metal steamer was very loose - not sure how it's connected to the water tank, or if that played a part in the machine breaking.

I've de-limed the unit , soaked the water reservoir in water overnight (twice) but every time I brew just hot water (no coffee), the water that comes out to the carafe contains silver-white particles (see picture attached, this is after the 12th time I passed water through the unit to rinse out the interior). Looking at the water reservoir, the inside of it looks crudely made and when I used my finger to touch the inner thread where you would screw the top on, silver particles fall off. This is where the water is stored and I have absolutely NO CONFIDENCE in how clean the coffee will be. See the pictures I have attached, the one with plastic around it was the 2nd unit I received which contains white-green gunk. I understand that we have to clean these units but this is too much. I've called both Amazon support and Mr. Coffee support lines and they've all been helpful but if it's a material defect there's nothing they can do.",

                "review_text": "This is a very disappointing purchase and I do NOT recommend at all. As other reviewers have noted, the coffee produced is a VERY STRONG DRIP COFFEE, NOT ESPRESSO. It is acceptable to drink as long as you don't try to think of it as true espresso. The picture is for marketing purposes and not an accurate representation. The \"frother\" is a disaster. It does steam but does not froth the milk no matter which method you use including the booklet's minimal instructions. I used a frothing pitcher, the recommended 2% milk, moved the pitcher in the right direction (both circular and vertical) but GOT ONLY STEAMED MILK, NO FROTH. The frothing wand of the machine also has a tendency to spit the milk upward making a mess. I don't need to start my day with these hassles and still not get espresso and frothed milk. Also mentioned by another reviewer is the design. It's definitely a case of design for eye appeal not utility -- form over function. Despite the appearance of metal, it is made of CHEAP PLASTIC. Look closely at the on/off knob and water compartment cap. That sloping contour is extremely smooth with no surface variation making it VERY DIFFICULT TO GRIP OR TURN. If you have any grip problems with your hands or weakness in your fingers, it's nearly impossible to turn either of these. I'm not a newbie to espresso machines or to frothing the milk. I've had positive experience with another brand machines (no longer made) that is in the same price range. Unfortunately, the company doesn't make the lower $$ machines anymore. I may have to reach deeper into my wallet to buy a better espresso unit but it won't be Mr. Coffee brand (I still like their drip machines though). The reviews here on the Mr Coffee ECM160 4 cup Steam Espresso Machine were mostly positive which is why I bought the machine. In the end, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND it for anyone else and I regret my purchase. I'm returning it if permitted. UPDATE: Amazon rules do not permit the return of this unit because it is now used and not new. I wanted to clarify also that extreme caution should be used when using the \"frothing\" feature. When we were using it, part of the spitting I mentioned resulted in droplets of steamed milk landing on the hand holding the pitcher. Your immediate reaction is of course to let go of the pitcher which would only cause greater problems spilling out steaming hot milk. Frothing with Mr. Coffee is not for children.",

The frothing arm is too short, close to the machine and doesn't move. I used my cousins Mr Coffee espresso machine (different model) and the arm was flexible and that made it so much easier to get the right angle when frothing. And last, but the worst part about the machine was the plastic/metal smell and taste in my espresso. When I opened the lid to add more water the smeel was overwhelming.

It's a cheap piece of junk to be sure, yes, but it's junk nonetheless. To reiterate what other reviews have touched upon, the machine doesn't actually produce 'espresso', but rather a stronger cup of regular coffee--that is, the coffee's as thick and viscous as you'd expect instant coffee, tea, or water to be. The steamer works, but don't expect to get a lot out of it. The coffee machine also doesn't come with a tamper, so if you don't already have one, you can expect a good portion of your coffee grounds to be neglected / wasted every time you brew. During the first 4 weeks of having the machine, all of that was fine. The coffee wasn't spectacular by any measure, but it was passable. More importantly, the machine actually worked. 1 month + 1 day after delivery, however, the machine stopped working completely. The espresso dispenser no longer functions; the steamer no longer steams; the heating element no longer heats. The whole thing simply died. And all this happened exactly 1 day past the return / exchange date. In short, buyer beware. I'll be recommending that my own friends and family avoid the Mr. Coffee brand in the future.",

It wasn't quite so nice, the parts were cheaper but it worked well enough. This latest purchase was disappointing and I almost returned it. It's poorly made and I had a hard time getting it to steam the milk after the espresso had been made. I've reversed the process and steam the milk first and toggle back and forth to keep the pressure up in the machine. I will not buy another one.

It hadn't exploded in a week so I got lazy about watching it to see if the handle was beginning to turn on the coffee holder to the left (as that is what happens.. it blows that piece off) and was washing dishes. Low and behold.. massive steam eruption and coffee grinds all over the wall and counter. My husband heard it explode from the other room and came running wanting to know if I was okay! It is very much a safety hazard along with being a complete mess maker. Before I purchased this I saw the youtube videos of other customers that this happened to, but I thought they just must not have had the top and the coffee container on tight. I was wrong! I make sure everything is on super tight before I brew and yet again it has exploded!! Beyond upset that I wasted $40 on this machine just 3 weeks ago when I should have just bought a pump one. Mr. Coffee is going to be getting a not very nice letter from me. I have bought Mr. Coffee machines for 4 decades but if I don't get a refund .. this will be my last!!",

There is not enough pressure/steam left in the machine after brewing the espresso to froth or even warm the milk. I used a 12 ounce frothing pitcher with about 5 ounces of milk in it and it wouldn't even warm the milk let alone froth it. I had to pour more water in the reservoir in order to froth milk which takes extra time and effort. So after you brew your espresso it sits there getting cold while you fart around cleaning the grounds out of the filter and reassembling the whole thing again just to brew hot water in order to get enough pressure/steam to froth your milk. I owned this same machine several years ago and it worked great. If you read reviews like I do and judge the worthiness of purchasing a particular product by the reviews, pay attn to the year the review was written. Today is December 10, 2014 and I am on my way to UPS right now to return this crappy machine. You get what you pay for folks.

This machine only worked the first time water was ran through it. Every other time its been used, water leaks out of the chamber/tank inside the unit. It appears the water tank inside the machine might not be sealed right or whatever sealant was used weakened and degraded after hot water passed through it. I was hoping the leak was from me not securing the attachment with the coffee grounds in it tight enough, but this isn't the case. I made sure it was snug and secure and watched the unit while it went through the brewing process and saw water seeping through the seams. Only about half of the water put into the unit process through to the espresso. The other half of the water leaked out and covered the counter top. It's a shame this is such poor quality. I expected more from the Mr. Coffee brand. As a result, I'll be sticking with the Bella brand in the future.",

Two went back to Amazon, and finally giving up there, we went directly to Keurig for a 3rd. Each failed utterly within a minuscule window of time. The longest we had one work was I think a week or 10 days? Shortest was DOA. I like to give a manufacturer or seller a chance to make it right. I'm convinced with this product, they do not have the ability. Fail city. ********************************************************** Original review below ********************************************************** We have a larger Keurig but it wasn't a great fit for us. It takes up a lot of counter space and is difficult to take with us when we travel. This K-15 unit seems to be a lot easier to live with in that regard. It is smaller and easier to pack away for traveling. I have a 1500 w inverter in my camping trailer to supply AC power off grid. This unit works with that inverter without tripping the overload, so that's a plus. The unit draws about 1.5 watts just resting whether on or \"off\". Start the brew cycle and the heater draws about 1350 watts for 2 minutes, then 4 watts for 30 seconds while pumping before returning to the 1.5 watt resting load. So if you use it off-grid, you want to unplug it while not in use. You have the option to vary the strength of your coffee by putting in less or more water, but the reservoir must be refilled each brew cycle. It's probably worth mentioning that the first two units we ordered were both defective. One worked perfectly for about 6 cups of coffee, then ceased being able to pump the water after heating. The other had something wrong with the electronics... it never responded correctly to the controls. Amazon customer service was great which emboldened us to try our luck a third time and shazam, we have a winner - the third unit just works as advertised. If it were not for the inconvenience caused by these two non-functional units I cannot think of any reason it would not be a 5 star review.",

I don't use the \"pods\" because of their cost and their effect on the environment, and the reusable filters only take 2 Tb. of coffee, so there seems to be no way to have a \"robust\" cup. Some people suggest putting the same pod through twice - but then you've got 12 oz. of coffee when you only wanted a cup, so you have to spill off the rest, plus the extra time it takes to brew two cups ... might as well just stick to the pour-over method, where you can control the amount of coffee and water, the temperature of the water, and the speed at which you pour it over.

                "review_text": "This was the first Keurig I've purchased and while I was excited when I initially unboxed it, my excitement soon turned to disappointment. The first cup of coffee I brewed with it using ground coffee and one of those k-cup filters was an unmitigated disaster. It was a watery awful tasting mess. I have tried several times since to brew with my own ground coffee at varying levels of fineness and I have been unable to brew a decent cup that way. My second attempt at brewing a cup of coffee was with one of Keurig's own K-Cups. Again the coffee was watery. I tried again, with less water, filling only half my mug, and this time it was better, but still not fantastic. Also the coffee wasn't very hot, which was part of the reason I ditched my crappy Black and Decker single cup coffee maker. I was tired of having to microwave the coffee every time I made it. I was considering returning the thing at this point but I still had a couple boxes of K-Cups to go through, so I kept trying. Then one time when I was halfway through my K-Cups all of a sudden not only was the coffee strong, but I got out twice as much water as I put in before I hit brew! I assume that there is a hidden reservoir inside this thing and for some reason it was not pumping it properly. From this point, I got decent coffee for a while. Or maybe it was just my imagination and I had gotten used to the weaker Keurig coffee. Whatever the case, I was somewhat happy with the machine for the rest of the month. But then it stopped making coffee entirely. It would just brew and steam and I could not figure out where the water was going because every few attempts it would allow more water in... I eventually figured out the water was somehow draining into the base from inside the thing when I opened it up to try cleaning it. And I didn't think it could possibly work, but rather than pull the whole thing apart trying to figure out why the pumps weren't priming, I stuck a safety pin up inside the top needle (I knew the bottom one was clear because I was still getting no water even without a k-cup in there) and lo and behold suddenly I was getting coffee again! I don't know how such a tiny amount of grounds which appeared in my cup after could have blocked that needle so well that the pumps could not clear it, but apparently that was the case, because I tried ten times to brew coffee before clearing that needle and I was making no progress at all. Anyway, I give the thing three stars because it's more convenient than spooning out grounds and cleaning out a filter constantly for a lukewarm cup of coffee, but I take away two stars because it's unreliable, the coffee is somewhat weak, and there's no temperature control and so my coffee is still lukewarm.",

The problem, and the reason I only gave it 3 stars, is it will clog up where the unit goes through the coffee pod after a while. It really needs to be slightly redesigned so you can clean the little tube and dispenser unit much easier. When I see it is starting to clog, I run plain water through it a few times now and dislodge the small coffee particles that have begun to clog it. (They say to run vinegar through it periodically to remove water problems--and I do that also). There is a youtube video showing you how to unclog it with a paper clip, but this is only a temp fix. Real fix involves removing tiny screws and cleaning tube, and then putting on a new tube tighter to keep it not leaking. If you are mechanical, no problem, if not, unit may become unusable if it really gets clogged up. I threw my first one away because I thought the unit had gone bad. No, it was just clogged",

Somehow, tilting open the cup holder seals off the reservoir but you get to learn this through trial and error. This last time, the reservoir leaked anyway and the machine just quit working. Kureig customer service is horrible. They are impossible to make actual contact with a live person.

Unfortunately, because we bought it for our RV, we did not test it in time to meet the NARROW window of return opportunity. What is that about???? The plastic was cheap, the coffee was cold, and the functionality was awkward. We feel duped. This is an update to the above review following an actual call to Keurig: Buyers, many companies have teams now-a-days where there job is to watch reviews for negative comments and then respond. The notion is to show others reading them \"oh, hey...look, this buyer had a bad experience, but the company was very responsive and is offering to rectify the situation\". The reason is multi-pronged. For instance, the company wants to show they \"care\" as well as that they are doing something about the issue...that they stand behind their product. I decided to actually call due to the real frustration regarding this K15 model Keurig. Well, this is where things crumble regarding Keurig's concern or desire to do something for the buyer of their machines. I was basically told I must be an idiot, a liar, or a thief. The representative was surely trained to respond to customer calls as her answers were very \"canned\", meaning taught responses and tactfully defensive regarding Keurig's machine quality and how so many other buyers are raving about this machine (why do I care-just a further attempt to belittle me?). Despite my desire to move into a better built model (hopefully), I was told they weren't capable (or is it willing) to allow me to simply return and or exchange this unit and either buy or exchange and pay the difference for another. So, reluctantly, I was made to succumb to the same model replacement. Further, I now have to send back some internal part on my own dime??? Really???? I suppose this is a tactic to keep warranty hounds at bay. Due to the machine issues, I would think that Keurig would want the whole machine back to check what happened on the quality front when engineering it. Instead, they are more interested in ensuring I don' t have the ability to use both machines. HA! I'd be lucky if one works. Thanks, Keurig.",

If you are looking for something that is portable, and something you are only going to use on occasion, then this is probably for you. Whatever you do, don't bring your travel mug, it won't fit under the dispenser. Even if you take the drip tray out, a travel mug will not fit under the dispenser. You can still brew a 10 ounce cup of coffee as long as it's not a taller cup. So if you want to use your travel mug, you have to brew into a shorter 10 ounce cup, and then pour it into your travel mug and you're on your way. I only use this one rarely, so that's not a deal breaker for me, but if you are in a hurry, it's a little bit of a pain. Also, after you put water in, you have to wait a little bit before the water warms up to dispense. It's not as quick as your regular Keurig. The last downside is that it doesn't heat the water as hot as a regular Keurig.",

I thought the level guide was something that was marked on the inside of the reservoir. So I just wound up using a measuring cup to measure out the amount of water I needed. After having it for almost 2 weeks I felt this was a little inconvenient and I wasn't getting a full cup of coffee so i watched a Youtube video on how to fill the reservoir. That's when I found out that there was a piece missing from my coffee maker. I still had the original box and packing material which I went through to make sure I just overlooked it. It was not included which makes me believe that this was a refurbished coffee maker and not NEW as described. I have no other way to contact the seller to find out if they can send me the piece I need.",

The drip tray never catches all the water it \u201cconveniently\u201d ejects with no warning, so don\u2019t have any water in there already. And don\u2019t remove it to fit your normal, human sized coffee mug or you\u2019ll have water rapidly shooting across your counter. This is a steaming pile of garbage!

Only a standard size coffee mug will fit with the drip pan in place. It removes easily, though for a taller mug. My 10 or 12 ounce tall cups barely fit, but the capacity is only 10 ounces anyway. Super tall travel mugs will not fit. You will have to use something else and then pour into the taller mug.

All attempts were followed by at least a couple of gallons of plain water to flush the system. Nothing has worked. The plastic taste and odor remain. Total waste of money.

It's still under warranty, so I called Keurig and they asked me leading questions that made me feel like they were trying to find a loophole to not honor the warranty (e.g., what kind of water do you use? what kind of coffee brands do you use?). Then, they tried to walk me through the same troubleshooting steps I had already taken before I contacted them. I finally got someone on the line who said the product is definitely broken and they will ship me a new one and will email me instructions on how to send back the old one. A few days go by and I don't get any emails so I call them again. The representative asked me to try the same troubleshooting videos on their site again. I told her I have already been over this and a previous representative said a replacement was being mailed. She said she now sees that information on the account. She said a replacement will be on the way. More than a week goes by and I still don't get any emails or the coffee maker. So I call again. This time, a representative says they are experiencing an IT problem that prevents her from checking the status on my replacement order. :o( I don't even want a replacement anymore.

It finally stopped brewing on a consistent basis so I bought this model to replace my old one. Right out of the box, after I brewed 2-3 cups of coffee, this maker stopped working. It would brew maybe 1\" of disgusting, gritty coffee concentrate if it brewed at all. It seemed as if there was a problem with how the water would drop down into the chamber after pouring it in and pulling the lever. I promptly returned that machine and Amazon kindly sent me a replacement machine of the same model. That one worked for about 3 weeks and then it did the exact same thing! I started looking at more of the reviews here and I cannot believe how many consumers had the same problem I've had with this terrible piece of junk machine! I wish I had realized this before I bought this thing. If you're considering this machine please heed my warning and that of others here. I'm glad this replacement machine pooped out when it did so I can send it back - and I'm glad I saved the packaging, twice! But do I love having to go without coffee while I deal w/ replacing this machine twice? No. Do I love repackaging this piece of garbage - twice? No. Do I love hauling this heavy box back to the UPS store twice? Not at all. I'm a busy mom and each time I do this I've got a fussy toddler in tow needing to be strapped in and out of her car seat repeatedly. And doing this and dealing with her without coffee is just cruel! I don't know how Keurig gets away w/ selling something so shoddily made that a full 1/4 to 1/3 of people are having it break, not work, or not brew properly. It's junk! My old $50 Mr Coffee K Cup maker lasted nearly 10 years with no problems and I've also had a Nespresso machine just as long and it's so sturdy I swear it's perfect despite the fact I've only descaled it once in a decade! It could be thrown out of a high rise window and survive while this machine doesn't work after 2-3 brews. I'm done w/ this model and Keurig as a brand. Shame on them!",

The first one we received was bad from the start, although I did not realize it. It would often make only 1/2 cup or be luke warm. There were coffe grinds in the finished coffee. We contacted Kurig and the customer service was great. First we tried all the troubleshooting procedures, but they ended up sending us a new one. Unfortunately it started doing the same thing in less than a month. They offered to send us another one, but would not refund our money because it was not purchased directly through Kurig. There is definitely a defect in this product and I would advise folks to stay clear of the smaller sized Kurigs.\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude24",

This isn't some bizarrre criticism of someone trying to stuff a 20oz mug into a Keurig that can only dispense up to 10oz. My normal 8-10oz coffee cups will not fit the K15 without removing the drip tray, which basically means there will be no circumstance where I could use this unit WITH the drip tray, which would almost certainly mean a constant mess. My 16oz Thermos won't fit this unit at all, even with the drip tray removed. I was planning to dispense two 6oz servings into my 16oz Thermos for taking on the go.",

Given the price of the unit, and cost of the pods, I will not repurchase. I\u2019ve already moved on to a tradition coffee marker; it was half the cost, more feature rich, and far cheaper to operate. Frankly, with paper coffee liners, I find it\u2019s easier and faster to make one small pot of coffee than two cups of coffee with the k cups.",

I spent about 40 minutes brewing hot water through the keurig over 2 mornings. This morning, the stream was powerful enough again and I was able to brew a 10oz coffee. I think somehow the grounds from my k cup got stuck in the brewer and needed to be flushed out. I'll keep the product, but if it happens again, I will ship it back.

Lastly, even if I drink a cup of this terrible coffee I still get a caffeine headache, which tells me I\u2019m basically just drinking water. This was such a waste of time and money and I\u2019m annoyed that I can\u2019t even return it.",

There is no water reservoir, which works well for us, but getting the water into the machine is seriously annoying. You cannot just pour water in . . . You have to follow a specific sequence: 1. Turn it on. Why is it important for the power to be on? 2. You add water to the upper reservoir. If there is too much water, it drains through a siphon into the drip tray. Is that a feature somebody wants? 3. You have to open the K-Cup holder, even if you just want hot water. The water slowly gurgles down into the water tank. Slowly. Wait for it. 4. You can now start your brew. If you went through the sequence without turning it on first, you have to lift the lid and the K-Cup cover just to convince the machine that you went through all the steps. 5. If the person before you didn't wait for all of the water to gurgle from the top to the bottom then there is a chance that you will overfill your coffee. However, there is no way to stop it mid-brew. The machine thinks that it is the boss of me, but it is actually quite stupid. I guess that makes sense.",

I looked online and found that if you punched on the machine above the water lines it would brew and that \"fix\" worked a couple of times but then I got tired of having to spend 30+ minutes trying to get it to brew coffee. I donated that machine and bought a Hamilton Beach 49981A Single Serve Scoop Coffee Maker which has worked beautifully for almost 5 years. The only thing is that you have to clean it after every use. I thought that Keurig had fixed the issues with their machines by now so I took the plunge in May and bought one for the convenience of having disposable pods. Boy was I wrong. I bought it in May but didn't actually start using it until July. All I can say is that Keurig disappoints again. For the past week, the machine now will only brew half a cup of coffee. And then when it feels like it, it will use up all of the water that it hasn't used for the previous cups into one so you better be ready with another cup so you don't have a hot mess in your hands. Needless to say I'm not even going to donate that machine. I'm going to throw it in the trash. You could not pay me enough money to buy a Keurig machine. Lesson learned.",

It's compact and doesn't take up nearly as much space as my K55. There are three minor setbacks that you should be aware of. 1) There is no reservoir.. Water must be added every time you wish to brew a cup. We thought it'd be smart for us to just keep one cup of water always \"loaded' in the heating tank and another cup in the measuring reservoir... that was a mistake. We quickly found out that once you open to put a k-cup in, it dumps the water from the measuring reservoir into the heating tank. The heating tank was already full and water went all over the counter. 2) Because there is no tank, the machine heats the water on demand. This takes additional 2-3 mins to brew. 3) It's definitely shorter than I expected. It's actually too short to fit any of our regular 10 oz mugs without removing the drip tray. Kind of a bummer because it's definitely not tall enough, even with the drip tray removed, to fit any of our travel mugs. This isn't to say that your regular/travel mugs won't work, but ours didn't. We just leave the drip tray removed all the time. When we want to use our travel mugs, we have to use two cups to get the job done. I've included some photos so you can see what I'm referring to. I have to take a 1 star away for the fact that, without removing the drip tray, it doesn't really fit anything other than standard 6-8 oz cups (like you might find a Denny's or IHOP). I would take a 2nd star away because, although it can brew a 10 oz cup, it doesn't fit ANY of our insulated travel mugs. Obviously that's not Keurig's fault but it still annoys me that I have to brew into one cup and pour it into my travel mug..",

My mother-in-law has this in her home and we really liked the fact that it was compact, simple & easy to use. Makes up to a 10 oz drink. You can remove the tray to put a slightly taller mug, but nothing tall like a travel mug (plus, you would need to make 2 separate servings to fill a travel mug). Just pour what you make in a regular mug into a travel or taller mug. There's no water storage container; you pour water before you make you coffee/tea. Not a big deal for us and we like knowing we have fresh water with each serving. BTW we have a regular full size coffee maker, but sometimes we only want one cup &/or something special (flavored coffee). This Keurig is perfect just for that. We've been using this for almost a month. No problems at all.",

I strongly recommend to people with small space in the kitchen (like us) to do not buy anything bigger than this. It has the perfect size to be placed in a corner.

The machine makes a consistent cup of coffee and has proved to be a good value. The beverage could be hotter but this remedied by an $8 cup warmer-coaster-thingie. You must follow these steps: 1. Fill mug/cup with water and pour it in the reservoir while pod holder is closed. 2. Place cup under pod dispenser. (More about this later.) 3. Open pod dispenser; water drains to warming tank. 4. Place pod in holder. 5. Do not close pod holder and press the button on the lower right front of the machine. 6. A light illuminates telling you to close the pod holder. (God forbid you close it before this step . . .) 7. The brew button on the upper right front of the machine illuminates. Push it. You'll have coffee in about 2 minutes. Back to step #2. Since I picked on the engineers in my first review, I now have to give them some love. I was distracted the other day and had to leave my desk right after starting a brew cycle. When I returned, I could smell coffee but there was no cup on the machine. Alas, I did not place the cup on the machine. I was looking around for a mess but found none. The machines is designed for the cup to sit on a drip tray. This tray holds an entire cup of coffee! That made my day!! In summary, I would give this machine 5 stars if produced a hotter brew. Someone reviewed this machine as \"coffee with compromise\" which is an excellent summary. But with a little help, I have good coffee each day and save at least $50 monthly on Starbucks while at work. Nice! Original Review You must read the instructions and not deviate one iota or you will have a hot mess on your hands! I got it downs after a few mishaps and it makes a fair cup of coffee. The coffee temp is not as hot as my Zojirushi full size maker at home so I would never use one these at the house. I bought this to save money because my yearly coffee bill at work was close to $1K. I placed the machine on my desk. The overall size is okay. Once I purchased condiments, etc. my cost now weighs in around $250 yearly, if I can keep finding Starbuck K cups on sale. The 75% reduction is worth a fair cup of coffee, I use a ceramic cup so I bought a $7 cup warmer to remedy the temperature issue.",

Yes - you cannot fit traveling mugs. Large size mugs will fit OK if you remove the drip tray. I also heard stories about dirt/mold that builds up in the reservoir of the classic version of the Keurig's, so I kind of like that this one doesn't have that. So far - I'm loving it.

More than 10 Oz water will overflow down to the drip tray. When you open the coffee chamber the water drains from the reservoir and flows down to the heating unit. If you open both at the same time, you can fill more than 10 Oz - the pump runs until the heating unit is empty.

If you use a taller mug, you will have to slide out the well under the spout, but that is no problem. I like this machine a lot.",

There is no reservoir to fill, so the water must be added each time the machine is used. Some people complained about the machine being too small for a larger mug to be put under the spout. It will accommodate a slightly taller mug if you remove the drip tray, but we only have shorter ones, so personally, this is a non-issue for us. This little beauty has been a nice addition to my kitchen because now my mother-in-law can have fresh coffee every time, and if she forgets to drink it, there is only one cup to toss. The minimal waste makes me feel a little better. Lastly, we love the cheeky blue color! All in all, this was a good idea.",

One thing I should mention is that you should only put one serving of water in at a time. The machine does not work well with more. I love that it shuts itself off.",

It has a tendency to clog when I use some K-cups (not pods) - and even the Keurig brand cups have caused it to clog. Takes a long time to poke all the holes clear with a paper clip. I know that's a problem with the single use Keurigs, but the old one rarely clogged, and this one clogs much more frequently. Sigh.",

I had read reviews and was worried about a few things but it turns out (IMHO) some of the \"problems\" are from people NOT following directions. First I ordered the Keurig that I thought would work best for ME. I did not want a reservoir as I only usually drink one cup a day so I got the smallest one. I'm LOVING it! Used to just drink my instant. Now its like I get a Coffee House experience daily but even better I can just heat the water in the Keurig for my instant too if I've run out of K-cups. I've had a blast trying different coffees and a few teas and am saving the hot chocolates for winter:) So - no problems here but I do have some suggestions. If you don't want the needle to get gummed up DON'T leave the used Kcup in it for grounds to dry out in it. Dispose immediately after making. I'd suggest just using it to heat water on a regular basis too. Next - there is a certain order to how this unit MUST be operated. First pick out your coffee, then measure water for cup (must be LESS than the gauges in top or water WILL run over into bottom) pour into top. Turn unit ON. Lift section where pod goes - this allows water to run into heating chamber- be sure to wait til all has run down. Put in pod, close and press the flashing blue button. My coffee has always been more than hot enough. Remove used pod (careful - hot!) and toss) If you follow this you should be trouble free and enjoy your coffee. So far my best Coffee has been from the \"Real Good Coffee\" company. Love my Keurig, feel so special each morning now - and I don't pay Starbucks for it! I also got the Keurig rolling tray to keep my pods in and the maker goes on top with my sugar containers. Rolls back each morning!",

There is a water level guide in the top which is not really necessary because you just have to fill the size cup you want to use with water and pour it in the top and that makes just the right amount of coffee for your cup.

I have it for a month now and no issues at all. The only thing is I drink 16 oz coffee every morning filling up my travel mug, I have to use 2 k-cup. The coffee taste so much lighter if I only use 1 k-cup even on 10 oz water. Transferring the coffee to my travel mug and brewing 2 times is the only hassle for me. But I can live with that. Over all I love the size and the ease of use. I also bought a a reusable k-cup and filter and use it once in a while. I recommend to have the reusable k -cup too if you wanna save more money on k-cups",

This is a one-cup-atta-time coffee maker and uses the familiar K-cups (if you were not sure, because the description is a bit unclear). You can fill the brewer with 6-to-10 ozs. of water, using the somewhat primitive levels found inside the fill area on the left side. This brewer takes a little longer to make a cup than our previous unit. Mug/cup size: if you use a mug of any height other than the run-of-the mill cup size, you will need to remove the drip plate, which easily slides out. Expect to have to remove it. Be sure to follow the ORDER of events in which you set up the pot-kcup-water, because the water needs to flow from the reservoir into the pot for brewing. Unit may be turned off manually or shuts off in 90 secs after a cup is brewed. Very few bells and whistles on this unit, but so far it has been working well. Amazon's price was the best I found.",

We have a K10 at home and the new K15 at my work apartment. For those who have experienced short cups and over flows, let me clue you in on a poorly documented quirk of this design. When you lift the handle to put a pod in, the water flows from the top (where you put it in) down into the heating chamber. It only flows while the pod bay door is open. If you open it, put a pod in and close it all rapidly, you will stop the flow of water down into the heating chamber, and you'll get a short cup. Listen to it and wait for the gurgling sound to stop completely before you close the pod bay door. If you do that, whatever you put in will be what you get out.",

Bought this to replace a K10 which had a rusted bottom and which was acting flaky -- not coming on all the time, just sometimes, no pattern evident. Did an extensive side by side inspection of this K15 with the old K10. I found the two units to be identical, with a few cosmetic differences and two functional downgrades of the new unit. I discussed my findings with a higher level customer support person in their Vermont headquarters. She seemed to agree that the two units are the same. In the new K15 manual the pages that show all the components show two water level indicators that actually have since been removed in the manufactured K15 units. My new K15 did not have them, my old K10 does. These are (1) the water fill tank fill level indicator (10 oz, 12 oz, 16 oz) with in a gray plastic insert which fits in the upper water fill tank, it fits upon a four molded-in tabs on the bottom of the fill tank, and those tabs are lacking on the K15 I received. Thus I could not simply move the fill level indicator insert from the old to the new, I tried to, but lacking a fixed insert tab to act as a latch the level indicator floated, making it worthless. The customer service representative was aware of the change. She was unable to explain why the manual had not been updated. She claimed that in user testing the company had discovered that overfilling the tank was less likely without the fill level indicator. (2) The overflow indicator in the under-cup drain pan. This is a float indicator that lifts up to show a red band indicating that the drain pan is close to full. It is on the K10, and is shown in the K15 manual. The customer representative explained that the company decided that since removing the fill tank level indicator lessened overfilling, that the drain pan no longer needed an overfill indicator. The cosmetic differences include: the font used in the \"KUERIG\" embossed lettering on the fill tank handle in front is different, the modern font is a bold block font, the older a serif, thinner font. The labeling on the brew button is different.",

You hit the flashing button, and boom, fresh coffee is pouring in about 1 minute. My husband and I use this daily, and we love that you can just make 1 cup at a time. It only takes a second to make another cup, so we don't mind just adding water each time we use it. It's small, quick, efficient, and makes a darn good cup of joe. I would recommend this to anyone that wants something simple, and isn't too picky about having multiple coffee options. I have no problem using my larger mugs, you just slide the base out and you can fit a really big mug in there. If you have a tall thermos, you can sort of cram it in there and lean it sideways, and it will work just fine (or fill up a mug and pour it into the thermos from there). Works great, especially for the price.",

I owned the first one for a few years after buying it based on a Consumer Reports article that pointed out less expensive products you could buy with comparable quality to more expensive models. I never noticed the overwhelming plastic smell in either coffee maker that I read about in some of the one-star reviews. I like the coffee it produces and that it turns itself off after two hours. I sometimes use the program feature to time when it turns on and that has worked fine. I have had to run vinegar and then water periodically to clear the passages so that the nozzle squirts the water into the coffee properly. Otherwise the water can seep down onto the hot plate and sizzle. The interrupt feature is not as consistent as it could be, but I rarely need my coffee that quickly so it is a non-issue. Finally, sometimes the paper filter folds down and I get some grounds in the carafe, but it is pretty rare and perhaps due to the particular filter. After a few years, the unit seems to need vinegar treatment more often and it has a stained appearance from daily use all this time, so I treated myself to a new one. Now my second one is running as good as the first one did. I will add, however, that my buying decision was aided by a big sale they had on this model for under $20. At full price I might have researched it further.",

So we returned the Ninja, and I thought \"wait..Mr. Coffee lasted 10 years.\" We purchased this one when it went on sale, and it did not disappoint! The carafe makes an actual 12 cups like it says. The lip where the coffee pours out is shaped so that coffee doesn't drip out when you pour, that was really my only complaint about the old one. If you want a no frills, unfancy but inexpensive and reliable coffee machine that does the job, get this one!",

Also turns itself off if you haven't touched the pot in a while. If your pretentious, go by a \"high end\" machine. If your sane, buy this one.",

(The Black & Decker coffeemaker never completely emptied the water reservoir when it brewed a pot of coffee -- it always left a cup and a half behind. I discovered this when I brewed my second pot of coffee -- and had a cup and a half of water overflow from the reservoir onto my kitchen countertop. Brewed several more pots with the same results: 12 cups of water IN, 10-1/2 cups of coffee OUT. The engineer in me cannot overlook this egregious defect.) Anyway, this replacement Mr. Coffee coffeemaker works GREAT! I've only brewed five (always full) pots of coffee so far, so I can't attest to the coffeemaker's durability. But the coffee tastes good, and all the controls work perfectly and just as described.",

COFFEE 12-CUP PROGRAMMABLE COFFEEMAKER, CHROME It was time for us to purchase another coffeemaker and having one of these currently, we decided to purchase another one just like it. My hubby drinks decaf only and I drink 'real' coffee, so for us, having two coffeemakers is a must. You can't go wrong with the MR. COFFEE 12-CUP coffeemaker. There are so many great things about this unit -- Looks great sitting on your kitchen counter Pause control -- can't wait? Remove the pot and the brewing will stop so you can pour your coffee NOW Automatically shuts off after being on for two hours -- beeps when shutting off After coffee is brewed and is ready to enjoy, a beep sounds to get your attention Removable filter basket for easy disposal of grounds and cleaning Nice and clear water window on the side for easy filling Cord storage in the back so you may hide that unsightly cord Brew strength available from regular to strong blend My only quibble would be that the digital clock is somewhat hard to read. This particular coffeemaker has won BEST in the category for three years -- 2011 - 2012 - 2013. The carafe is available in thermal or glass and the unit is self-cleaning. We use good old white vinegar and this works well. If you are in need of a new coffeemaker, this is the one for you. Not only does the coffee taste wonderful, rich, hot, fresh, and delicious each time, but the coffeemaker itself is attractive and you can' beat the price, Start your day off the right way with a superb cup of coffee brewed in your new Mr. Coffee. Thank you.",

The control panel is a little more complicated than necessary because of some unusual features, but it is intuitive and although I shouldn't say this, you really don't need the manual, So, here are the pros and cons: PROs - 12 cups - Nice, but make sure you purchase the larger size filters. The smaller 4 cup filters just won't work very well. - Two hour shut off - a must for a coffee make that is designed to keep the java warm for a while. If you forget it, the coffee might not taste very good as the water evaporates, but it won't stay on long enough to crack the carafe or cause a fire. - Brew strength options - I haven't tried this yet and have always just used a little more coffee to make it stronger, but this feature could save you some money over the long haul - very long haul. - Programmable for a timed start - essential for those of us who like to wake up to the aroma of brewing coffee. CONs - This model comes with a water filter that fits on top of the grinds basket and filters the minerals coming in from the \"showerhead spout.\" The manual recommends that the filter be changed monthly. I have never had a problem with hard water, although I use a water filter on the kitchen sink. Unless you have really foul water, and then again this might not help, I suggest that this is a totally frivolous feature that is designed to get you to trot out to the store and buy more filter replacements since it is recommended that the filter be changed every 30 brews or monthly.. Fortunately, the coffee maker does not require this. You can make the coffee without using this filter. - The unit also has a built in sensor that determines whether you are using a glass carafe (provided) or a thermal carafe. I imagine that the metal skin of the thermal carafe triggers a magnetic switch which prevents the warming tray from going on. I actually bought this unit because I was unhappy with the Mr. Coffee thermal carafe unit I had been using, since it was more difficult to clean than the glass, and the coffee was never really hot enough. All in all, it's a nice coffee maker, but I think these extra features have to add something to the price. I can't help but wonder how much less it would have cost without the water filter and the carafe sensor. Since both of these features are optional, I was tempted to give the unit FIVE stars, but I feel a little annoyed that the manufacturer is trying to put something over on us. Just my opinion. As John Galt says, \"Value for value.\" If the price is acceptable to you, then it's FIVE stars. Get the bagels and coffee cake ready. Breakfast is served.",

I could not get it to start brewing again and the hot plate seemed to turn off as well. Overall, for the price...Almost 2 years of daily use has been great.

It leaves coffee moisture which turns to stain quickly in the pour lip. I know, it's no biggie, and I am far too sensitive over little irritations like this. Yes, it is hardly worth mentioning here......so why bring it up at all? I don't know except it just irritates me. But so does the cat when she vomits on the garage floor! Sorry. It makes great coffee as a \"Mr.\" should, right? Wipe down with a couple of paper towels - or three if you're a fuss-budget like me, and leave the lid open and it eventually dries out totally.

I initially bought this based on good reviews and the ability to get a thermal carafe at some point, though I have yet to make that jump as the coffee is usually gone before it starts to cool down too much. The water filter was good for about a month, and I haven't replaced it since, I just use the maker without it and have had no issues. The water where I live isn't hard or soft, so there's no real need for filtering. The filter is just a carbon filter which would remove little more than odor or taste from the water. I didn't see it as useful unless you had issues with your water. It looks decent on the countertop, and doesn't take up too much room. The lid is a bit cumbersome as it is quite large and can't be opened under my cabinets, but it's really a non-issue as it is easy to move around. If it stopped working today I would buy another without hesitation, but it's so simple I doubt that it will go wrong before several years of use.",

In order to fix and not buy a new coffee maker, you need to simply replace the fuse underneath the coffee maker. Just take the bottom cover off and you'll find 2 small silver fuses in series (there are 2 for safety) Take your meter and see which one is bad, or just replace both. They are super cheap on amazon. It's a super easy fix with your soldering iron and it extends the life of a great coffee maker!",

We don't use the program to have the coffee turn on, I make our coffee the night before and when one of us awaken in the morning, we simply turn it on. We get up whenever we please, and it will automagically shut off 2 hours later! THAT part we really appreciate! :) We use the Strong brew, the coffee is always nice and HOT - we always had to zap our coffee from our other coffeemakers, as it was never quite HOT enough to please either one of us. There is no \"plastic smell OR taste!\" as is mentioned in several reviews. I don't use the 'water filter' because I fill it from my Brita pitcher. There is no \"leaking\" and there is also no way the cover can be closed and have the 'coffee run all over the place' because the spout wasn't over the coffee grounds! There is an arm in the cover that will push the spout over the coffee grounds.",

Here is her review: A little background on my relationship with coffee: My dad had an inexpensive Mr. Coffee coffee maker that lasted him eight years. He was your typical hard-working mechanic who started out every day with the newspaper and two cups of strong, black java. The night I started my very first job, he stayed up late just so he could have a pot of coffee and some flapjacks waiting for me when I woke up. I don't take my coffee black like he did--vanilla creamer and sugar for me--but he and I shared a love for coffee. We're coffee people. I'm not a barista or coffee connoisseur with the dedication to grind my own coffee beans and use a French press, I'm just a coffee person. The smell of coffee wakes me up better than an alarm clock and the warm, bittersweet weight of coffee on my tongue is what tells me it's time to get to work. So, when it came time to replace the old coffee maker a friend gave me for free a couple years back, I knew it was going to be a Mr. Coffee. I decided on this one because it's 12 cups and programmable. I was a little concerned when I checked the reviews and saw complaints of a burnt plastic smell, especially since I have a very sensitive nose, but I figured it was worth a shot. I trust the brand and, if all else failed, I could just put in for a refund and find something else. I received it a few days ago and now I'm here to say that I won't be getting a refund. This coffee maker is fantastic! I sniffed at it when I ran water and vinegar through it to clean it and didn't smell anything strange at all. I've been actively looking (er, sniffing) for anything strange in all the subsequent pots of coffee I've brewed and there's no burnt plastic smell or taste. In fact, this coffee tastes even better than the stuff my old one used to make because of the included water filter. I'd almost grown accustomed to that yucky chlorine aftertaste from my old pot--it took me a second to realize why this tasted so much better! Also, it was very easy to set the time and program it to have a fresh pot waiting for me when I woke up this morning. Call me lazy if you'd like, but that is a feature I plan to thoroughly abuse from here on out. No more sleepily shuffling around the kitchen and knocking things over in the morning trying to get a pot of joe going! All in all, so far, so good! Might just be the \"honeymoon phase\" that comes with a lot of products. I'll check back in after a month or two to let you guys know if my opinion changes. :)",

                "review_text": "I purchased this pot for use at work. We needed a coffee maker that was easy to use, made good coffee, had a few perks (other than the coffee)and was a reasonable price. The coffee we make goes into two different hot-pot carafes, the Zojirushi 2.45-Liter Brew-Thru Air Pot, Polished Stainless Steel and the Mr. Coffee DRD95 8-Cup Stainless Steel Double-Walled Thermal Carafe Accessory , both of which do an excellent job at keeping the coffee hot and fresh tasting. The Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome has been performing exactly what we wanted it to. A consumer magazine rated this as a \"best-buy\", which is why of the hundreds of coffee makers available on Amazon, I took a good hard look at this one, including reading the Amazon reviews add decided to buy this brand and model. Because I was making coffee for a number of people, I actually took the time to read the directions - and - follow them! That might be one of the reasons I'm quite pleased with this product. It is easy to use, fast to set-up and then clean later, fool-proof on overfilling (if you read the directions) and best of all, we've gotten lots of compliments on the coffee, brewing several brands and flavors. The only thing I'd do differently if I were designing this coffee maker, is make a bit longer cord. I understand it's short for safety, as it probably should be, but where I'm using it at work, I have to find someone who can crawl under a desk for me to plug it in. I know some folks have height restrictions on their counter tops. You do need to pay attention to how tall this product is, both open and closed and make sure it fits your space. A through review of product specs and customer reviews helps make sure you're getting what works best for you!",

Ditched the filter that everyone was complaining about being so expensive to replace as we use filtered water anyway. Easy to set up the system to brew automatically in the morning. I like the strong brew feature. Coffee is just as hot as other coffee makers we have had. It does turn off after 2 hours and isn't adjustable. If I hear it beep and I want it on longer, I just hit the bre button and it will come on again for another two hours. Very happy it turns off by itself or I would have burned coffee.",

                "review_text": "For the past 4 years, we've used a Cuisinart DCC-1200 that has been okay, as long as I would dismantle it (twice) to adjust the contacts on the on/off switch. The unit would turn off during a brew cycle due to a faulty switch connection. We decided to pass on getting a replacement unit and settled on this Mr Coffee model, mostly based on the high rating in Consumers Reports. After reading some of the reviews here on Amazon, I wondered if it would be a wise decision, as no one wants their coffee leaking from the decanter onto the floor or counter top or smelling like burnt plastic. Those who complained about the leaking problem are either putting out a scam review, or they have a different model than the one we received. I tested the glass decanter, and there was NO WAY I could get it to drip over the side. It poured directly into the cup with no dribbling. I tried pouring it very slowly and could not get it to run down the side of the decanter. One reviewer said she had to 'lift the cheap plastic lid' in order to pour the coffee. Well, I don't know where that bit of info came from, but the lid is not cheap plastic, and you don't have to lift it at all.....hmmmm. We ordered the optional thermal decanter and it is very solid. It has an 8 cup capacity and has no pouring issues either. The coffee quality is as good as your water and coffee can provide. It brews quickly and gives you a hot cup of coffee, at the right temperature. I did not detect any off-tastes due to plastic. I did smell a bit of plastic during the first brewing, but this is normal for new appliances that are heated. The plastic is 'off-gassing' some of the volatiles and this should subside after a few uses. The unit is very well-designed and looks great on our counter. It is actually shorter than the Cuisinart model and that is a plus for us. The controls are great and easy to use. Setting the clock is intuitive, and programming it for a delayed brew is very easy. It is also a 'smart' unit, in that it senses when you are using the thermal decanter, and automatically turns off the hot plate under the decanter. It also has a button that lets you see how long it has been since the coffee was brewed. As far as I can tell, it will heat the glass decanter for 2 hours, before it beeps 3 times, then shuts off. With the metal decanter, the unit shuts off immediately after brewing (no lights are on). The LCD showing the time is easy to read, but you need to bend over to see it. The instruction manual says there is a red light that will light when it's time to clean the unit, but I can't find this light anywhere. The unit is easy to fill and the water level can be seen easily in the gauge on the right rear. If you need a cup of coffee before it is finished brewing, you can pull the decanter away, and it gives you 30 seconds to pour a cup, then replace the decanter. I detected no leakage of coffee when I did this (contrary to what some other reviewers have claimed). Make sure you have some basket-type coffee filters (not cones), or have ordered the optional permanent filter basket, since these are not provided with the unit. The unit also has a water filter and holder that fits over the basket and under the water 'shower head'. I'm not sure this is a good design for the filter, since it is another item you need to install before every pot, then clean afterwards. The Cuisinart had a drop-in water filter, that worked before the water entered the brewer. I like this better. We don't use any filters since we use filtered water from the fridge. All-in-all, this is a great coffee maker at a very decent price. The option to get a thermal decanter for it is a big plus for us, as we will be pouring less coffee down the drain in the future. I expect to get many good pots of coffee from this coffeemaker. If I find otherwise, I will update this review.",

I have the thermal pot as well which does a great job, but the glass is the normal day to day work horse. I do buy the filters ($7.75 for an 12 pack) just because I don't like our city water much, and they seem to do the job alright, I notice when I don't use them. Overall, I'd say when you compare to a $20 coffee pot that can do the same work as this one, the little add-on's this has is worth the extra $10. I don't know what else I expect it to do other than keep correct time and go off every morning so I can come out of the shower to a fresh pot of coffee, and it does that well. 5 stars for doing exactly as expected!",

                "review_text": "Replaced my former Mr. Coffee maker with this one when the other one just decided it wasn't going to make coffee anymore, suddenly. I like the sleek design of this one better. Coffee is really hot when done, which is a MUST for my husband. You can adjust the strength of the coffee too. It really makes the perfect pot of coffee and my husband likes that you can turn on the signal that beeps to let you know the coffee is done so you'll know to come and get it. No need to keep checking, if you're in another room. We have a permanent mesh (washable) filter which I always like much more than the paper ones. No chance of coffee grinds skipping over a paper filter that is not inserted just \"exactly\" perfectly. And, again, it's a really nice design to the unit itself. I also like that it's not a glossy black finish. My prior one was and it showed smudges and fingerprints a lot. This one doesn't. Easy to just wipe the exterior casing with a damp or dry cloth. Can't think of any negatives EXCEPT a couple of incidental ones, which took away one star. With my prior coffee maker, the \"cleaning cycle\" was easier. If you're not familiar with this, it is advised/suggested that you clean your coffee maker's coffee making parts at suggested intervals to remove mineral deposits which can damage your machine. With my former Mr. Coffee machine, you put the specified amount of vinegar (or separately bought cleaning solution made for this purpose) in the water well and it would process the initial amount of the vinegar and then \"sit\" for the specific time required for the cleaning cycle to do it's thing and then automatically release the rest of the vinegar through the system at the appropriate time. THIS one doesn't do that. It does have a clean cycle but, after putting in the vinegar, you must manually dispense X amount of the cleaning solution (i.e. vinegar) then stop the coffee maker for the specified time and then, again, manually start the dispensing of the vinegar again until it all runs through the unit. This means you must be looking at the clock while cleaning this unit to determine when to do what. The prior one did it on it's own. All I needed to do was (as with this one), follow up with brewing full pots of WATER a couple of times then, to make sure all the vinegar is rinsed out. Not a big deal to do. Also, I don't know what's with the \"pot\". We wash it but it stains from the coffee anyway. Wonder if it's a glass mixture, if there is such a thing. When I first noticed the light staining/slight discoloration of the coffee pot, I noticed then that the \"glass\" didn't feel totally like glass. I'm afraid to scrub the pot for fear of scratching it. We KNOW the pot's clean because we know we've washed it so, for us it's not a big deal but I'd be embarrassed if I had someone over for coffee and they saw that it looks like we just emptied the coffee out, and made another pot without cleaning the pot. When it goes through the cleaning cycle, these discolorations disappear but, I'm not going to soak the pot in vinegar every night! It's not really dark staining or discolorations so please don't let that stop you from buying this. Or, maybe it's just the pot that I got. BUT, really, all in all, the discoloration of the pot is a minor thing. And, the different \"clean cycle\" is a minor thing. If something happened to this one and I needed to buy another one, I'd buy this one again! What's most important is if it makes a good pot of coffee and this one does! We use regular, canned coffee and this brewer does a good job with it. And, it's a HOT pot of coffee -- some coffee makers lack that and initially serve mildly hot coffee, until it heats more while sitting there. I've tried various coffee makers. This one's really good at doing what it's supposed to do.",

I really like that you can change the brew setting for normal or a stronger brew. The stronger brew seems about perfect for me, and I'm really picky about my morning coffee. It is easy to clean, I just run some vinegar through it from time to time, and wash and rinse the basket and pot after each use.

Also, with any product, read the manual. If not how to make it work, but how to take care of it. Pros: -The lights. Kind of cheesy, but going from a Bella non-programmable to this beauty, I love the fancy schmancy colored lights. -The brew strength. Yeah, it only has two options, hardcore or meh, but my husband has acid reflux and the rare times I do share my coffee (lol) I try to brew it light. Otherwise, cool. -It came with a water filter thing. I bypassed using it as I use jugged spring water from the market, but I suppose if you have hard water and don't buy jugs of water this may be good. -The cute beeps! I read previous reviews stating the beeps are as loud as a laundry machine. I'm a housewife. I do laundry with my Cabrio series on loud. These beeps aren't loud. You'll hear them in the next room subtly, and if you put your ear up next to the machine yeah it's loud then. For me, if I'm doing dishes, the beep is perfect. Moving on.. -Overall design.

Before my first pot of coffee, I ran it with just water a few times to get the smell out, but that didn't work. So I made my first pot, and it tasted fine. When the coffee brews, it doesn't smell, but anytime I have to lift the lid for the reservoir, all I smell is plastic. Again, the coffee tastes perfectly fine. Just makes me wonder.

If anything I'm drinking more coffee than I used to, so I'm spending more in that regard, but while that's in part this coffee maker's fault, how bad can it be that your coffee maker makes such a good cup that you want more? I don't know - you be the judge. But I like the coffee better than the coffee I got out of my Keurig. I didn't bother with the metal insulated carafe - the two hours of heating is plenty for my purposes. I like the extra filtration of the water, although I haven't had to replace that filter yet so I don't know how much that costs - I think it's around $6, and the units apparently are recommended to be changed every 2-3 months, since mine came in January or February (I can't recall, honestly) and \"April\" was already set on the filter frame for me. I also like the \"strong brew\" setting - never could get a rich-enough cup out of the Keurig no matter how much coffee I tried to pack into the K-cup basket, and this is a nice option on this unit. Haven't tried all the pre-programming features - I really like fresh-ground beans and fresh water, so I probably never will use that feature anyway. Nice cup of coffee though - great unit for the money.",

I read Consumer Reports on different coffee models, and Mr. Coffee was highly recommended. I also browsed through Amazon's customer ratings (some not so great due to burnt smell complaints of said coffee maker) on this particular model. I've not had one problem with the plastic burnt smell. I suppose if it's brand new I did notice a slight smell, and ran my water & vinegar through a couple of test cycles. This morning, I made my first pot, and it was great! No more half-filled cups of coffee frustration. No more running to the store to buy expensive coffee pods. And I didn't have any issues with coffee spillage! Just measure water precisely and it does the job! And great for the price. Instructions was clear and concise. I personally recommend that glass pot be thoroughly washed daily after use and I believe that this last me for a long time Not bad for a single grandma (stroke survivor) who likes just one cup in the mornings. I will definitely recommend this coffee maker. Thank you Amazon! As always, you delivered well on your products!",

                "review_text": "I love my coffee, but I'm not one to plop down $100 or more for our morning brew, and I like to make it by the potful, not the cupful. Over the last 40+ years I've gone through a lot of coffee makers, and this is the first one ever to impress me at so reasonable a price. No wonder it was one of the top rated machines in 2011 and considered a \"Best Buy\". First I need to say that if you want a TRUE 12-cup coffee maker, this isn't it. The standard for a \"cup\" of coffee has been 6 oz. for as long as I can remember (and that goes back to when we made our coffee in percolators). Every other 12-cup machine makes 72oz of coffee (12x6 = 72). This 12-cup makes 60 oz. So by redefining the size of a cup of coffee to be 5 oz., they call it a 12-cup coffee maker. Sorry, but it makes only 10. I'm OK with that because I never make more than that anyway, but you should be aware that 12 will get you 10 in this case. Now, on to the review ... The machine is handsome to look at in black with chrome trim and highlights, and is easy to wipe clean. It is very easy to fill (with a clear water-level window) with a generously sized opening so you don't spill water outside the machine (I've had one with which I had to use a funnel to insure that I didn't spill water all over my counter top). The controls are intuitive, easy to use, and brightly lit LEDs indicate the settings. While the LCD clock is not backlit, it is easily seen from most angles. There are two brew settings: \"regular\" and \"strong\". The strong setting just releases the heated water at a slower rate so it filters through the ground coffee more slowly but, of course, it adds to the brew time. Either setting can be used with the automatic timer. The LED indicator lights are bright to let you easily confirm your settings. The machine can be used with either the standard glass pot or the optional carafe. While the glass pot holds 60 oz. of coffee, the carafe holds only 40 (or just over 6 \"standard\" cups). The coffee maker automatically detects whther you are using the glass pot or the carafe, a nice touch. Another small but nice feature is that when brewing is finished, the machine gives 3 soft but easy to hear beeps that the coffee is done. The pot stays heated for 2-hours, after which time it automatically shuts off, again sounding the same 3 beeps. Of course, you can hit the \"on\" button again to keep the coffee hot, but you will quickly hear another 3 beeps (as when the coffee was first done). After 2 weeks of use, I have gotten nothing but consistently good coffee, pot after pot using Melitta Basket Coffee Filters, Natural Brown (8 to 12-Cup), 200-Count Filters (Pack of 8) . The sides stay upright and the very fine texture and thinness let the natural coffee oils through. Bought in bulk, they are just over a penny apiece. In the end, I am very happy with this coffee maker that is attractive, easy to use, gives me a consistently good cup of coffee, and have several features that others at this price do not. When someday it goes, I only hope it's still made so that I can buy another. Highly recommended!",

The water filler for this has exceptionally easy access, the entire lid opens to add the water. The gauge on the side of the product is relatively accurate for the number of cups you get. Either I like weaker coffee or I've not been adding enough grounds, but the suggested number of scoops in the instructions for a given pot size, is more than I've used in the past. The one touch brew is a nice to have. The one thing that I learned the hard way is that the basket that holds the grounds, needs to be aligned to the locating groove inside the coffee maker when reinserted after cleaning. Not observing this alignment, causes the basket to be misaligned with the coffee pot below. Here is what happens: The pot presses up slightly on a valve that allows coffee to flow from the grounds basket, into the hole in the top of the pot. If this valve in the basket is not depressed (raised in relation to the pot), the grounds basket has no where to allow the hot steaming coffee to go during brewing, and coffee and grounds will flow over the top of the basket an then down around the pot!! You only do that once.... Haven't tried the delayed timer, but it's a personal thing about heater elements coming on when I'm not in the room, nothing to do with the coffee maker. Consumer reports likes this coffee maker too, that's what got me looking at it after our other one died.",

You just load it and hit the lower left button that says \"select/off\", and it will start brewing. It does not take very long at all and the coffee is nice and hot. My old coffee maker did not keep the coffee very hot at all so this is much appreciated. It beeps when your coffee is done but it is not an obnoxious, painful beep. I am unsure if you can turn this feature off. I have not tried yet but I honestly don't mind it. The coffee tastes great. It comes with a water filter that you place over the basket of coffee grounds. I just take it out and place it on a clean paper towel to air dry after it is done. It seems to work fine. It is also great that it makes up to 12 cups at a time. I would definitely recommend this coffee maker. I can not say anything bad about it, at least not yet.

(Other, newer Black and Decker models have not lived up to this one, and why they've changed the design is beyond me.) Went for the Hamilton Beach 46201 first, based on the reviews, and I don't understand why people seem to love that pot. They must like lukewarm coffee. I returned that mistake and went for this one - now THAT's more like it! Hot from cup 1 (and as you should know, the temperature of the hot water hitting the grounds is VERY important - this pot gets it right). Brews a cup every bit as good as my old B&D. Now, is it perfect? No. The carafe is light as a feather - handle it with care. The inside of the brewing area never seems to rid itself of condensation - it collects in several spots, which you can either dry out with paper towel, or just tip the machine backward to drain. And, yes, the plastic smell you've read about is there, but for me it was gone after 2 or 3 brews, and it NEVER flavored the coffee. And aesthetically, the shiny, fake chrome look is kinda cheap and annoying (but not as annoying as having to potentially pay an extra $15 for the all-black version, so I'll live with it). A backlight on the clock would be nice, too. And the Fresh Brew Timer is useless - it starts from the beginning of the brew cycle, but it should start, IMO, at the END of the brew cycle after the 3 beeps (their way, your coffee is already \"12 minutes old\" right after a full pot brews). All minor issues, as far as I'm concerned. Hot, uniformly-brewed coffee, cheap pot, it's a winner!",

Make sure to run a couple cycles with water only to get the \"burnt plastic\" process out of the way, which seems to happen with every coffee maker out there (no matter if you spend $20 or $200). Water seems to be hotter during the brew cycle than past coffee makers we've had, which seems to affect the flavor of the coffee. With our more expensive coffee, a better flavor results, but with our normal day to day coffee, Folgers, the hotter water tends to being out more of a bitter flavor of the coffee. We are still playing around with the amount of coffee used. There is the possibility to use a thermal carafe that we probably won't need. Most of the time we turn off the appliance after the brew cycle is complete. But, if we forget, the appliance has an auto shut off after 2 hours, which seems to keep a good pot of brewed coffee from burning. We thought about getting a Kerig appliance but have too many coffee drinkers in the house to justify the cost. Our household uses the 12 cup carafe per day. Kerig's carafe is an 8-cuper (40 oz; in coffee maker language 5 oz = 1 cup, not sure why). Perhaps we will get a Kerig one-cup coffee maker to use on those rare times just one adult is in the house or for those times non-coffee hot drinks are made.",

I do like this machine, however. after a few months this Mr.Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT is starting to do what my old coffee machine was doing of why it was replaced.... It just has not gotten as bad (yet) as the old one. The machine is to have a pause mechanism for when you are brewing a pot of coffee, it pauses and you may sneak a cup. I have to have this, with being a coffee addict and my inability to wait for the pot to be fully brewed :) ... At the moment it does it once in a while, and usually it is not pouring out like my old machine used to, but I am sure over time it will, as that is how things go, and nothing lasts forever. I have cleaned the machine, and that some times helps with this but some times does not. Over all I give a 4 star review because it is wonderful machine, and the pause feature works most of the time but just some times it is faulty; which can be annoying but it is not flowing out, and it started after a lot of uses as well..

Where it goes to initially at least is the storage shed behind our home. Over time, that storage shed fills up and things have to go out of it. Where they go is to the dumpster. The latest thing relocated to the storage shed is our old Hamilton Beach coffee maker. We named it Mr. Grumpy because it made so much noise it frightened guests, little children, and birds and animals. You\u2019ve already guessed that Mr. Grumpy will be relocated to the dumpster soon. Truth be told, I never trusted that Hamilton Beach. The first time I cranked it up, it began growling away and promptly spewed the coffee grounds, coffee water, everything, all over the kitchen counter, walls, and floor. From then till the very day it was relocated, I would do a head-jerk toward it midway through the brewing cycle to see if it was behaving itself. Now the Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t growl. It\u2019s so nice and quiet, I hardly know it\u2019s on. A soft little sound alerts me when the brewing cycle is complete. The coffee grounds and water stay right where they should. And get this \u2013 the glass decanter doesn\u2019t spill water when you fill up the water reservoir or when you pour coffee into a cup. Nice! There\u2019s a water filtration system that requires the purchase of filtration filters. We\u2019ve tried coffee with and without the system and can\u2019t taste the difference. Two hours after the brewing cycle the unit automatically shuts off. No worries there. Like all gadgets now it has a clock. You can delay the brewing if you want to. You can select the brewing strength; regular or strong. Plus, Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome, is actually attractive. All of that for less than forty bucks. Very nice!! It will probably be a long time before the Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome, is relocated to the storage shed.",

The only drawback is the appearance of the front of the unit. I don't know why I expected an appliance this inexpensive to have a stainless-steel appearance, and, of course, this doesn't.

I like the look and operation of the Mr. Coffee much better To the coffee making: Pros: from the first pot, there was NO plastic taste; you can select an longer drip option for stronger coffee which I like. the countertop appearance is nice. it beeps (not too loud) when finished brewing and then again when the pot automatically turns off (2 hours I think?) ; the time setting and programming options are intuitive and work fine. Cons: pouring water into the reservoir is a bit awkward; all-in-all - a very reasonably priced value coffee maker that produces as good a cup of coffee as the beans you use.",

                "review_text": "I am satisfied with this coffeemaker, but it took about 10 days of using it to finally get the coffee at the strength and flavor I wanted. I prefer a medium to strong coffee with no bitterness, and following the manufacturer's recommendations resulted in very weak coffee. I tried several types and grinds of coffee as well. For an 8 cup pot (40 oz. with this model) I now use a slightly rounded 1/3 cup of finely ground coffee for what I consider a good cup of coffee. There is a brew adjustment feature which allows you to make regular or strong brew. On the \"regular\" cycle, the coffee is made very quickly, but the resulting coffee seemed quite weak. If you prefer a stronger brew, be certain to use this feature. The delay brew feature is handy when you want your coffee ready first thing in the morning. The controls are easy to use. There are indicator lights of the front panel as well as a digital clock. However, the clock and the functions are not lighted so I don't find them very helpful and they can't be read in the dark. This coffeemaker comes with a water filter, which is a simple disc that you insert in a plastic ring and put on top of the coffee filter housing. The recommendation is to change it monthly, however I don't have a problem with tap water, so I don't plan to purchase filters or use them at this time. I use generic 10-12 cup paper filters for the coffee and have not been able to locate Mr. Coffee brand in any local stores, so I don't think it matters which brand filter you use. This coffeemaker comes with the option of a stainless steel carafe. The unit is fairly large (big shoe box) but it is stable on the counter. All things considered, this makes a decent cup of coffee after experimenting with the proportion of coffee to water.",

Since I drink coffee rather infrequently, I decided to try a standard old pot coffee maker and gave this one a try. This was on sale for only $19, and with the Mr. Coffee name, it was a no-brainer. I'm so glad I took the chance and didn't opt for a costlier model! This little coffee maker works great for the price. The coffee tastes great, is nice and hot, and the machine is easy to use. I like the fact I can program the coffee to be brewing in the morning when I wake up. It's nice to get out of the shower with a hot pot of coffee waiting for you.

What I do love about this one more is that the pot doesn't spill water if you are a bit impatient and pour it into the tank fast, and I kinda like that the filter system isn't built in like the last one for 2 reasons. 1-because it sits right on top of the basket, I have yet to have coffee grounds in my pot and 2- because I do have to remove and replace it every time I can A- be reminded to change it or B- not use it at all.",

A legitimate reason to shop for a new machine. When I read the reviews for this one and saw the mark-down on the price, all notions of a fancier machine--even here in Seattle, the coffee mecca of the USA--were immediately abandoned. If you drink coffee from a mug, as most in the USA do, be aware that a cup does not fill a mug full of coffee. If you want to drink a couple of mugs full before leaving home and then fill up your commuter coffee cup, and allow for the chance that another less regular coffee drinker in the family may wander in and want coffee too, then you need a machine about this size. It is easy to set up, and offers the choice between strong coffee or regular. It also has a timer so that your coffee can greet you when you stagger out of bed at crazy-o'clock in the morning, but we have not tried that and can't report on it. All I know is that this is a good, sturdy machine with no glitches. Everything is easily accessed, and it makes good coffee. Best of all, we got it free with credit card points, but if we'd paid cash, I'd say the same. Buy it while you can!",

After 2-years of continuous pots of java, I finally had to replace my old coffee maker (which was the exact same brand and model). A coffee maker that can last me 2-years is a unique experience for me. I have bought more expensive models and they quit working for me within a year. I read many of the other reviews. I have never smelled or tasted plastic past the first \"brew\" - clean water run through before using the first time. I did have a couple coffee messes until I realized how touchy the inner basket is. If it is not precisely in its little holder, the coffee will fill up the basket area then run all over the counter. The lid will go down even if it isn't placed correctly. PROS: - 2-hour timer - Ability to use a chrome carafe (sold separately) - Programmable (and it's easy) - Brew strength choice - Cheap price - Looks like an expensive coffee maker - Fits easily on the cabinet - Color matches my other small appliances CONS - The top lid gets very hot while it's brewing - Wish the coffee was just a tad hotter - The hot plate corrodes quickly",

It works fine, but if I donate it, some poor person will probably pay $15 for it, and they will be stuck with the drippy carafe. It's just so pointless. How hard is it to make a carafe that doesn't drip? My Mom told me back in the Eighties to buy a Mr. Coffee because a bunch of the other brands drip, but I got older and too big for my britches. I strayed. I had another fancy coffee maker that made great coffee for a few months. Then it started to taste awful and I realized that there were moldy coffee grounds in a part of the reservoir that could not be cleaned out. YUK. Then I tried the Kitchen Aid. I am still flabbergasted that Kitchen Aid can't design a carafe that pours without dripping. But never mind all that. Mr. Coffee took me back, and we are living happily ever after. So simple!",

It also has a filter that sits above the coffee and filters the water before it goes into the grinds. We already use filtered water in our coffee so we don't necessarily use the filter all the time but it's nice to have when we have to use tap water. My favorite feature is that the coffee pot beeps when it is done brewing. My last one didn't do that so it's nice to actually know when my coffee is ready to start drinking.

It's reasonably priced and makes good coffee. I do agree with some of the previous comments that there is a pretty strong plastic smell but this has dissipated with time. I would point out it never altered the taste of the coffee, but if this would bother keep looking. This is the first time we have used a coffee maker with a timer and love that when we get up coffee already made (old faithful started taking 30 minutes to brew one pot). The clock is not back lite so if you have to have that pass on this coffee maker. Set up and programming quick and easy. I would say not sure if the Brew Strength does anything. Seems to taste the same on regular or strong but taste great either way. If you just want great tasting coffee that might not be scalding but is hot enough you will have to wait a few minutes to drink it, this does a great job.

It had the stainless steel carafe. We order that extra for this. It is a screwy set up on this. The glass carafe is 12 cup. The extra cost stainless steel carafe is 8 cup. I cannot get the coffee maker to brew on the Strong setting if I use the stainless steel carafe. Also, the strong plastic smell of the coffee maker (and the coffee) for the first two weeks. Ewwwww. We waisted a lot of coffee trying to get a pot that you could drink. We also used vinegar and water several times trying to clean it and get rid of the taste. Finally, we are drinking coffee. It does an okay job, except for what I mentioned. You load the eater from the side and we don't like that either. That is where the water fill gauge is too. We would have returned this if I would have been smart enough to save the packaging. Mr. Coffee needs to do some thinking on their design and on the materials they use.

The old one had a lower base and you had to tip the carafe forward to slide it back on the warmer area - this one is easy to slide - it goes in straight so you do not drip coffee during the process. The carafe spout does not dribble like the other did while pouring (and after). The bright lights are easy to see at a distance to tell you what it is doing (or off) and the brew countdown is also a plus. The warmer keeps the coffee HOT until the full 2 hours are up. Also, having the control area high (above the carafe) means no accidental bumping of time or other buttons because it is in the way on the counter. It is compact and neat looking. Overall I consider this a great product. I did notice a slight plastic smell and the first several times I used it that lingered a bit. I did as suggested by many and ran a white vinegar cleansing cycle and that helped resolve it. I have not used the filter (nice addition) yet because we are used to coffee made with our local water, and the replacment filters seem hard to find and expensive. I also had a bit of a time with measuring the grounds (I use preground dark roasts) for the right flavor. I used the chart in the owner manual and that is no good for our tastes. I ended up measuring exactly as I had been doing in the old Mr Coffee and that worked. The one thing I noticed is when you pour in water to the 10 line, when the coffee is brewed, it is nearer to 8 1/2 line in the carafe. And you do have to pull the maker out from under a cabinet to fill it, but I had to do that with the old one as well. That is not an inconvenience to me. I would recommend this to anyone who is used to Mr Coffee products. I have had bad luck with other brands so I did not even look at them this time. Most had lasted less than a year, but my Mr Coffee was still working after 5 years, and I hope this one will do the same. It is early still, but so far so good!",

It's just drip, so you're not going to be getting the quality you would out of a French press, but as drip machines go, it's quite competent. There's one very real design flaw in this unit, however: the handle on the pot is a deathtrap for your thumb. The lid hinges in the handle, and the natural way to hold the pot while filling it is to tuck your thumb into the hole that appears when the lid swings back. Be very careful if you do this. If the lid swings back down, it will trap your thumb. Because the hinge is very close to the hole, the movement of the lid is compressed into a very short throw, so it's able to apply an extreme amount of force to your nail bed. This is absolutely excruciating. I suspect there probably have been real torture devices that weren't as well-designed for inflicting pain as this coffeepot. As long as you're careful while filling the pot, it does a fine job. But I don't give five stars to products that hurt me as much as this one did.",

While we loved the old coffee maker, the $100.00 cost was more than we wanted to spend to replace it. This one fit the bill and with the high ratings here on Amazon and on Consumer Reports, we decided it was a good bet. It is easy to use. Push a button and go. Very easy to set up the clock and the delay start. The coffee come out delicious. I have to say I don't notice much if any difference between the Regular brew setting and the Strong brew settings in the taste of the coffee. The brew pause, which allows you to take a cup while it is still brewing, works well. The Cuisinart would drip quite a bit but the seal on the Mr. Coffee seems to seal better and one drip or two is all you get after removing the pot. Though it says 12 cups, in practice you get about 11 after the coffee grinds absorb about a cup of water. The Cuisinart, due to the shape of the basket, absorbed about a half cup less. Not a big deal. All in all I would say this maker compares very favorably to the much more expensive maker from Cuisinart. Very pleased",

It's probably smaller than any other drip machine I've ever owned, so it's counter top footprint is minimal. I'll probably end up getting the insulated thermos for it, mostly for aesthetics though. It's too bad you sacrifice 4C of coffee in switching from the glass pot to the insulated thermos carafe. In terms of \"cons\" all I've noticed so far are: The clock isn't backlit, so it makes reading it tricky The water filter just balances on top of the filter basket--which having to remove it to fill/empty the filter basket adds a step to each pot of coffee, and it takes a little practice to get the balancing act right. More higher end Mr Coffee machines use a \"embedded\" type of filter which won't be so cumbersome during daily use. The machines beeps, like a microwave, when it's finished--which I suppose could be occasionally helpful, but I'll generally think it's annoying.",

                "review_text": "I bought this nearly a year ago for a friend, and I've used it extensively myself. At the time, I paid $30, making this a terrific value. At $40, it is now a bit less of a value. If you shop the Amazon Warehouse, you might be able to find the bestselling Cuisinart coffeemaker for close to $50, which is within spitting distance of this one. That's what I did when it came time to replace my own coffeemaker. The coffeemaker is generally easy to use. The control buttons are highlighted in chrome, making it somewhat easier to use for anyone who has impaired vision (such as seniors). Aside from the usual on/off, programming and set time controls, the coffeemaker lets you select brewing strength. Coffeemakers like the Cuisinart also let you control the hot plate temp, but this does not have that function. Filling the unit with water is easy enough, but I use a separate external measure because it's too difficult for me to see the markings on the side of the coffeemaker. This is partly a matter of eyesight and partly a matter of placement, since the side of the coffeemaker is up against a wall. Putting the water filter on top of of the basket can sometimes feel a bit clumsy; it doesn't fit too naturally, and I often have to fiddle with it. This is probably more my problem. Just FYI, the Cuisinart has an in-tank upward facing level which makes it a bit more convenient to use. And the Cuisinart filter is placed at the bottom of the reservoir whereas the Mr. Coffee filter sits on top of the basket, requiring the user to remove it and then replace it with every use. The coffee tastes fine. The water filter may or may not make a difference. I can't tell. In general, the city water for my locale seems pretty good, so the filter may not have that much to filter out. Replacement filters cost $10 for 10, which is a lot less than the Cuisinart filters ($6-7 for two hrough Amazon). Value shoppers should consider picking up a unit through the Amazon Warehouse. When Amazon says \"Used.- Like New,\" the unit really is new except that someone returned it. This unit deserves to be on the bestseller list and is a good deal if you can't quite justify buying the Cuisinart. I hope this helps..",

                "review_text": "Our coffee maker died. We were in a panic as we tried to find a good replacement fast. Then my wife whipped out a copy of Consumer Reports. In it was a review of the Mr. Coffee SHx33GT. The gist of the review was that this coffee maker out performed or equaled the taste and features of coffee makers two to three times the price. So, of course, we ran to the computer and got on Amazon. We were very curious regarding the customer reviews that complained of a 'bad' or 'plastic' smell and taste and the hard to poor carafe. But we put our trust in Consumer Reports and the positive reviews and ordered ours, ($40 free shipping). We got it in less than a week. I am happy to report that either the people that gave negative reviews were wrong, or maybe Mr. Coffee changed something since they bought theirs. I unpacked the coffee maker, ran one cycle of water through it, (no vinegar), and in 5 minutes I was drinking the best coffee I've had for a long while. And I tried to make the carafe drip as I poured it and could not get a drip. In fact with the design of the rim and the shape of the glass, it is way better than our old Mr. Coffee maker which not only dripped but had plastic around the rim that harbored coffee which dripped a muddy looking mess on the counter and floor. We are super happy with this coffee maker and I think the coffee tastes better than any I've had from other drip type makers. It doesn't quite make it to the quality of a percolator, (for those of you that are too young to remember, that is a coffee pot that continually cycles the water turned coffee through the grounds until it is the strength you want), but it's very close. All in all, a great coffee maker in a compact size that is super easy to use which produces great coffee. For $40 I don't see how you can beat that.",

I've owned several coffee makers including a high end Cuisinart but none as convenient as this model from Mr. Coffee. Even with the failure, I calculated that it cost me only $1.85 per month to have something that I like. Think about this, a single cup of coffee from Starbucks will cost more than that. So, all you naysayers in the reviews are missing out on the most convenient coffee maker on the market. Put things in perspective, a meal out will cost more than this coffee maker.

                "review_text": "The Mr Coffee programmable coffee maker is great; it replaced a GE spacemaker coffee maker that died suddenly after years of use. The Mr Coffee, which I had to replace after 2 years, 3 months, with the same model, because it ceased heating/brewing. The product makes either 12 cups in a glass decanter or 8 cups in a stainless decanter and figures out which decanter is in use. It also offers delayed brewing and brewing strength selection; not only does it have a clock but also the time since the batch was brewed. However, it keeps the 12-cup batch warm for only two hours, unless the select button is pushed after each two hour heating period. The same time restriction applies for re-heating. The optional stainless decanter keeps coffee hot for several hours if the air-tight lid is used, but it can't be re-heated on the warming plate. I drink coffee all day so constant use of the warming plate is desirable. The optional permanent filter basket is great; paper filters are not needed; just be sure to rest it inside the filter basket provided with the coffee maker. The other option I purchased is water filter packs, but I haven't used these long enough to properly judge whether they are really needed.",

                "review_text": "Didn't experience problems that others have written about...beep when coffee is done is not loud at all - about 1/2 the volume level of a microwave beep, or quieter. Pouring out of the pot is flawless - no running down the sides or even when pouring at a fast pace. Filling the machine with water...some have complained that it is a small target to hit. I say there is more than enough room to get the water in without spilling. The water \"sprinkler head\" over the coffee grounds easily swings out of the way to remove the basket, then it automatically moves into position when the lid is closed - foolproof. The glass pot can only sit in one spot on the warming plate, so there can't be any \"misalignment\" to create an over-flow situation. Others also complained about an overwhelming chemical smell when they opened the box - I only smelled it when I put my nose on it. I followed the directions for it's initial use and the first batch did have a \"new coffee maker smell/taste\", but it wasn't enough to discard it. The second batch was much less noticeable, and the third was unnoticeable. I like that the lid opens to the side and it is easy to access the basket, refill with water and add grounds. Programming clock and brew timer is straight-forward. I wish the display was back-lit - it would make it much easier to check the clock and brew timer each night. I don't use the included filter - not needed. I like that the lid can be opened and you won't get sprayed with hot water/steam like some other designs. My initial experience has been very good.",

The only thing holding me back was the amount of buyers who stated that there was a horrible smell that was quite difficult to get rid of. I took a chance and ordered it anyway. I am sure glad I did. There was no odor at all. The instructions tell you to run a pot of water through the system before making a pot of coffee. I did but added a little white vinegar along with the water. ( This I learned from a coffee web site ) Love all the features about this coffee maker. Fits great under my cabinets, doesn't take up too much counter space, the beep when the coffee is done and the coffee taste great. If I can find any fault with this maker it is the water filter that is included. The instructions are really not clear enough. I have yet to figure it out. No matter the coffee is great. Out of my 5 coffee makers I have owned in my adult life time this has to be the best.",

And they are correct that the plastic smell doesn't go away very quickly. Mine took about four weeks of daily use to stop being smelly. Once you get this coffee maker \"broken in\", it is probably the best designed $35 coffee maker on the market. The controls are easy to use, the basket is easy to empty and fill, it is easy to fill with water, it makes a half pot of coffee in about six minutes, the pot pours without dripping, and the coffee tastes great. Be advised that you may have to use a little more coffee than in some other coffee makers to get it as strong as you want. The so called chrome face looks a lot like shiny plastic (because that it what it is), but you can accept that since you should not expect stainless steel for $35.",

Even my expensive Kitchen Aid dripped all over---annoying and messy. I bought the thermal carafe and am pleased with that, as well. Love the option for \"STRONG\" brew, which was another feature that sold me---if I can see through my coffee, I'm not drinking it! I read the majority of reviews on this model, as well as several others and this one won out. If anything changes, I'll update, but it appears to be a great choice! Update 30Oct2016 The first one started leaking water all over the counter after 4 1/2 yrs., so I bought a Brewmaster from a different company. Hated it and went ahead and ordered another of these since it has all the features I want and was really a reliable machine that made great coffee. Despite some of the comments, I find the coffee piping hot even after adding half and half. Still love this model!",

Way better than most drip machines, including some that are nearly $100. We also bought the thermal pot which is nice as well. But we prefer the glass pot that comes with it because the coffee stays much hotter. We like it strong, so the \"Strong\" setting is very nice. It takes about 10-12 minutes to brew a pot of \"strong\". We found the water filter disc to be pretty useless because we have great tap water in our town. I guess it would be more useful if you had yucky tap water. No big deal though, we just don't use the filter disc. We never experienced the \"plastic\" taste others have noted.",

Most recently we've been grinding our beans and using an upscale Braun drip machine or French presses. When the Braun recently gave up the ghost I started looking for a good buy in a similar machine. I had bought a Mr. Coffee for work some years back and it lasted many years trouble free. I saw this one for a very good price on Amazon and decided to try it. It has been great. No difference from the Braun and we've actually started to use pre ground and paper filters and the flavor especially with medium roast has been excellent. We are very happy with this machine at this point and if it lasts for a good few years, we will consider it one of our better coffee machine investments.",

I do have two minor complaints. First, I need to turn the coffeemaker 90 degrees to fill it with water. I'm not sure why Mr. Coffee designed the machine to require this. Second, while the initial brewing temperature is excellent, the hot plate actually seems to keep the coffee too hot. If the carafe has less than half a cup remaining immediately after brewing, much of it will evaporate by the end of the two-hour \"warm\" cycle. For those who like to make coffee to be savored later in the day, this model may not be the best choice.",

This Mr Coffee is a dream in comparison. It was so quiet that I was not sure that it was even working. I do recommend buying the Mr. Coffee GTF2-1 Basket-Style Gold Tone Permanent Filter with it. Having the Amazon Prime made delivery fast and both came together. If you are looking for the perfect gift for Christmas, this model performs like the ones Braun.

I asked for a replacement so I will try and comment after I use the replacement. Not impressed at all so far! Edit: So I have had my replacement coffee maker for about a week now and I have to add a few things. First of all, the Amazon return policy is fantastic. As soon as I submitted my claim, the new product was shipped to my house. As far as the coffee maker goes, this time there was no condensation on the display, the unit smelled better after brewing, and I have had zero problems thus far. It must have been something in production that made the previous coffee maker function poorly. If the coffee maker keeps working as it does now, I will be very happy with the product.",

Personally, I thought what I paid was a bit steep though it was on sale (I'm a college student, come on) but after using it for about five months its a godsend. I read horror reviews of cheaper coffee machines either leaking, making coffee taste like plastic (OMG CANCER), or even turning on randomly and becoming a fire risk. So after all these horrible reviews, I settled for something slightly more pricey but ultimately functional. It does exactly what it says and it doesn't look to shabby either. It has the excellent option of choosing a brew strength as well as programed time, it also gives a little bleep when it starts and bleeps when it shuts itself off after two hours. The only thing I would say that could make this machine better would be if they installed a glow function for the display cause COME ON GUYS, its 2014 and even watches at the dollar store have that function.",

They sell a thermal carafe too. -Does not ship with the coffee filters. Neither metal nor sample of paper ones. Need the flat bottom 'cup' style (not cone) -Have to click the brew button twice to enter the brew later mode. Not intuitive but only an issue the first time (or when you ask someone else to set the coffee machine)",

I was pleasantly surprised when I opened it, I was expecting a little less pizzazz but once I got it out - Wow! This model has very nice features like a water filter over the coffee basket. It is also very easy to fill with water. Very easy to set up and it brews a very nice pot of coffee. I grind my own beans using the Mr. Coffee BVMC-BMH23 Automatic Burr Mill Grinder and use Mr. Coffee basket coffee filters and I believe I get a pot of coffee that could match most barista's pot of coffee. I have served coffee from this machine to family and friends and they all agree it make one good cup of joe! Highly recommend it with no reservations",

Although I can't really taste the difference when using the filters. I did try the permanent basket filter for this model, but went back to the paper ones promptly. I noticed a big difference in the taste of the coffee when I used the permanent basket filter (and not a good taste)....so paper it is.",

Plus it brews fast, allows you to select your coffee strength, is programmable, shuts itself off after 2 hours, and has an indicator to tell you when you need to clean the unit.

At the risk of duplicating many of the other reviews, here goes: Pros: - coffee is hot - programmable - no problems pouring coffee - I pour slowly anyway - water level side viewing window Cons: - no clock back light (consistent reviewer complaint). Fortunately, the programmable time is the same for me each day, so I never look at the clock once it's programmed. - problems with coffee filter collapse if I don't use the water filter. I have well water, so I filter anyway and I have no chlorine. I may try to use the filter insert without the filter. Having to put the filter unit in each time is one more thing to remember/clean/find/break. - I like the strong coffee setting, which, according to the manual, is \"sticky\" across brewing cycles (apparently resets if you press the button or unplug the machine). However, mine resets after every brewing cycle. Not happy - one more thing to remember. [UPDATE] CS rep says the setting should be sticky. I'm looking to verify the feature with another owner before proceeding with warranty process. - Could have done a better job on the manual. Some steps are poorly written and I'm surprised that they never discuss moving the spray arm back and forth during setup and cleaning. I wonder if some people forget and the spray arm ends up sending some/all of its water back into the reservoir. [UPDATE] I've learned from other reviews that the arm moves back into position when you close the cover. See, it pays to read the reviews! Is anyone else surprised that this model is NOT listed in Mr. Coffee's web site? I wonder what that means. I'll update in a month or so if there is anything new to report.",

When she read that this one really produced some of the hottest coffee, she was pretty much already sold, and since the machine also looked really nice, we decided to get one for ourselves for Christmas. It fulfilled all of the glowing remarks that we had read - but, unfortunately, it also lived up to the often complaint of really messy pouring anything from the decanter (either water or coffee). Sometimes it pours very nicely, but then it will dribble - or even pour - the liquid all around the pot or the cup. I would think that, after all the years of making coffee decanters, that having the liquid pour out neatly would be a piece of cake. But not with this coffee maker. But, we'll keep trying to \"get the hang of pouring\" because it's a very nice coffee maker in every other aspect - we really like the different colored lights, too - it really looks great in the kitchen!",

One of the things I noticed though, is that I see grounds being spilt somehow. I find grounds in the coffee, usually when whoever is loading the filter is uncareful. It may be because is sleepiness or trying to load it in the dark... But nonetheless, be neat about the filter, don't overfill it or there could be grounds all over. Just thought I'd give my honest opinion in hopes that it clears up confusion and mixed feelings. You get what you pay for, so if you're on a budget, this $20 programable coffee maker is perfect.

                "review_text": "First: It's a $40 coffee machine. So don't expect too much. My previous 10 yr old machine, a Cuisinart, died recently. Regarding some of the negative reviews. Yes, it ships in its retail box; however, the carafe is well protected by soft foam pads. My carafe does not drip when I pour a cup or fill the machine unlike some other reviewers complained. It pours great! (possibly manufacturing inconsistancies when the carafes are formed) I find it hard to understand why people were having trouble filling the machine. Like most standard coffemakers... You lift the lid and pour water in the back. Simple. No leaks. There are a couple of holes in the back of the machine near the top (above the fill line). I suppose if you are just (not smarter than a 5th grader) you might get water all over your counter by trying to pour more than 12 cups into the machine. I followed the directions and ran two full pots of plain water through the machine before my first pot of coffee. After the first pot of water I did notice a very slight 'plastic' odor. By the second pot of water the odor was gone. From the first pot of coffee to now (two weeks and 14 pots later) I've noticed no such odor in my coffee. I don't use the 'water filter' thats meant to sit on top of the coffee filter (weird/poor design IMHO) because I use filtered water from my frig. I set the clock. Set the timer. And every morning there's a delicious fresh pot of coffee waiting for me. Yes it beeps when the pot is ready and yes it beeps two hours later when it's about to shut off. My Cuisinart did that so I'm used to it. When you lift the lid you'll notice that the hot water spout is directly over the center of the coffee filter holder. It rotates out of the way so you can empty and fill the coffee filter. It is ever so slightly annoying that you have to move it out of the way (remember $40 machine). However, there's a little tab in the lid that moves the spout back into place when you close the lid just in case you forget to do so. The front is chrome plated plastic (kind of cheap looking) but it cleans easily and still looks better than plain black plastic. As it's only been two weeks I can't comment on long term reliability, but as with so many things these days I expect something to go wrong with the electronics or switches before anything else. So we'll see. If I get 5~10 yrs out of it I'll be happy. For $40 I think this is a well made simple coffee maker.",

SO I broke our old coffee maker's pot by accident and I along with other guys working there decided to buy this model of Mr.Coffee. At first we thought that we are not gonna get a quality coffee maker since it sounded too fancy with all those buttons and lights for such price ( we really did not want to go beyond the budget ). But then, after we brewed the first coffee, everyone loved it! I can say it is one of the reasons why I get up early in the morning very soon to get to the lab ( I know I can buy one for myself but I am taking advantage of this strong love in some way to achieve something academically). Coffee brewed by this machine tastes better than Starbucks if you use the right coffee. It can be programmed up to 24 hours before brewing your coffee and has all bunch of other cool stuffs for different brewing options ( regular, strong). The temperature of the coffee just feels so right, not too cold or hot. Also it has a beep sound which alerts when it is done brewing ( I guess it is such a simple and useful feature that many machines don't have ). Moreover, the chlorine filter is perfect which also improves the taste of coffee. You are avoiding a high concentration of chlorine entering into your body by a cheap filter which needs to be replaced every month. All in all, it is worth every cent which we paid for it!",

Setting its itme and time delay--a single button to roll the clock forward one minute at a time--was a royal pain and the thing broke a week after the warranty expired.) Setting the clock and time delay is quick since there is one button to set the hour and another to set the minute. The area around the hot plate where the carafe sits is sealed so that spills and over-flows do not seep into the base of the unit. It brews well from 12 down to 6 cups. My only concern is the water well never dries. The water well can't be dried by hand since it has has too many angles, ridges, small surfaces, channels, and tubing. All in all, a better product than most in its competitors costing costing as much as $20 more.",

This happened with both the Glass and Thermal carafes. I called Mr. Coffee and their customer service was outstanding. The person I spoke to was incredibly quick to understand the issue, offered to send a replacement of the same type of machine, or a different machine if I wanted. She knew that the issue I had has something they are seeing in current production and sent me a return label for the machine so it could go to their quality control dept. to examine. She made it clear that I should keep all the filter, brew basket, and carafe as spares - they just wanted the unit back for analysis. Well, the new unit works perfectly. It even seems to make slightly hotter coffee (measured just over 190F in the carafe for a freshly brewed pot), which is about 5 degrees warmer than previously - and enough to notice the difference. I use whole bean dark roasts and the quality of the brewed coffee has been excellent with this coffee maker. I'm happy to have the brew strength working as well now, but the \"regular\" setting also made very good coffee. I also purchased the optional Thermal Carafe, which is very well made and provides a nice option when I want to use it. A decent looking and good performing coffee maker if you don't get a defective one. If you do get a defective one, Mr. Coffee's customer service seems to be excellent (which is very hard to find today).",

The taste of coffee is okay; I am not a coffee expert, so I can't elaborate more than to say I find the taste okay and my husband likes it a bit more than I do. The big DOWNSIDE to this is its carafe. The plastic handle & lid seem cheap and hollow. The lightweight handle is ill-positioned and causes the center of gravity to be misplaced. It simply does not balance well in my hand when the pot is full. 8 month update: Coffee maker is dying. In the past couple of days, it has refused to let me manually turn it off. I usually turn it off after brewing to keep the coffee from burning on the hot plate. Now, it flashes 2 or 3 lights but won't turn off. We had to unplug it. Last night, it only brewed 10 of 12 cups. Upside -- Customer Service at Mr. Coffee is GREAT. The rep immediately diagnosed the problem and is sending out a replacement coffee maker. She asked if the machine has been releasing more steam than usual; it has. It turns out that even the build up of condensation in the clock is a symptom of its problem. There is an issue with the heating element malfunctioning. She couldn't say exactly what went wrong with the element, but was able to diagnose it sufficiently to warrant sending us a new one. She said it would likely completely stop working in the next week, so we called just in time! 2nd UPDATE: 2 days after I called customer service, the coffee maker died entirely. We haven't received a shipping notice, so we may have 2 to 3 weeks before the new coffee maker arrives. I think I will buy another brand and keep the replacement Mr. Coffee as spare. So, although I wouldn't repurchase this particular item, I would consider another Mr. Coffee in the future, since their customer service is so great, if the ratings are high enough.",

Not the case. We would move it to another outlet in the kitchen and it would turn back on, so we thought it was the outlet. My husband changed the outlet. That did not solve the intermittent issue. So I started looking for another coffee maker. I was alarmed to find that many people were complaining that their Cuisinart caught on fire. Then I looked at Bunn. I liked that because it was made in USA (?) People who had used Bunn for years were complaining bitterly about the recent models, saying they leaked all over their kitchen counter. It is supposed to be a bragging point that the coffee is done in 3 minutes? Sorry, I would rather have cowboy coffee than weak coffee that is brewed in 3 minutes. Finally I got PO'd and just ordered this Mr. Coffee, which cost about $35, and I had free shipping with Amazon Prime. I LOVE THIS COFFEEPOT. We have used it several days now- I bought the permanent filter, have just ordered 2 more so I can just put them in the top rack of the dishwasher. It has a setting for regular or strong coffee- so I'm kind of getting my cowboy coffee after all. I used to believe you get what you pay for. Perhaps I was wrong; this Mr. Coffee was about 1/3 the price of some of the high-falutent coffee makers I shopped for, and I just LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.

It's programmable and shuts off after 2 hours which makes leftover coffee reusable for iced coffee or reheating without tasting old and burnt. A stainless carafe is also available which I highly recommend. This coffeemaker recognizes either the glass or thermal carafe. The thermal carafe is 8 cup and the glass is 12 cup. The reservoir on the coffeemaker shows the water level for each and the burner automatically detects the carafe being used starting from the on position.

This is actually my second one - I had to return the first because it was defective right out of the box! But i literally received the replacement w/in 2 days of printing my return label and it's been working almost non-stop. Beware, it literally ships in the Mr. Coffee box with the label right on the top.",

It also has built-in functional features, like a protrusion hanging from the lid that shoves the drip arm over the basket (should you forget) when you close the top. This means that you can only err with countertop drip/spills by not closing the top lid altogether. We particularly like the brew strength button that lets you pick \"strong\" over \"regular\" so that we can get the stout cups of coffee we like while using less grounds. While the boxy styling isn't up to par as compared to sleeker, more expensive models, you'll be very happy with your cup of joe as long as you don't need to put on airs. Only drawback is the glass carafe, which--particularly when full--drips from its odd-shaped spout when it pours. It also seems flimsier than most (thinner glass?), so we bought the accompanying thermal carafe to tide us over if and when this happens. Definitely a BEST BUY!",

It pours water without spilling (I would recommend AGAINST a Kitchenaid for this reason), it doesn't drip water when removing the pot or the basket, easy to work, intuitive and a great price for what you get. I would never again spend more for one of the other brand coffee makers, as this one has all of the functionality of them, plus brews a comparable cup of coffee, keeps it hot after brewing and doesn't break the bank. The only small consideration is that you have to manually move the \"spout\" that sprays water on the coffee grounds in order to remove the basket, but a minor issue. After you replace the basket, it automatically moves it back to the correct place, which is handy. I wish they had done the automatic movement the other way as well, but not annoying enough to detract from a 5 star rating. Don't spend more when this is a great coffee maker at a better price!!",

It also has features which I've come to expect with coffee makers--timed delay, clock, and even a button which tells you how long ago the coffee was brewed. As many other reviewers have complained, this coffee maker did come with a rather strong plastic smell. I ran thru 2 pots of water to try and remove the smell, but it still lingered. Since I was doing a taste comparison, I ran thru a pot of coffee to compare taste and quality with the other coffee maker. The smell disappeared after running thru the coffee and never returned and wasn't discernable in the cup of coffee.

The brew cycle is quick, quite, and reaches a hot temperature. When brewing is complete the machine conveniently emits two short beeps. I purchased the stainless thermal carafe and we just love it! When using the thermal carafe, the machine recognizes it automatically and turns off after the brew cycle to avoid \u201cburning\u201d the precious java. The thermal carafe keeps the coffee very hot for hours! Kinda like the thermos I used in school long long ago. This machine is superior to others we tried. Very pleased and highly recommend.",

I use it to make both coffee and ice tea, eliminating the need for a tea maker. I like that it gives you the option of setting it to \"strong\" if you like stronger coffee. It beeps when it's finished brewing--an ok feature, but it usually takes 1-2 minutes longer for all the water to finish filtering through after the beep. There's also a delay brew, which I haven't yet used, but it would be convenient for someone who likes their cup of java as soon as their feet hit the floor. I've only used it with the glass decanter, although it has a \"thermal\" setting for a carafe. Overall, I like the Mr. Coffee coffee maker, and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again.",

The only draw backs have been that we always have to use the strong setting, but it's nice to have this feature. The water filter and holder is a bit flimsy and has already been lost, but we haven't noticed a change in the taste of the coffee. If your water needs to be filtered then it's best to use a pitcher filter to help with mineral build up anyway.",

Yes, you might get better coffee taste from a french press, but this one suits us just fine (ignorance is bliss right). The coffee is good; simple as that. Pick up a coffee grinder, a nice batch of fresh beans from trader joes or your favorite roaster, some quality coffee filters (cone shaped ones don't fit, but if you fold them on the bottom they'll work fine - i got them at TJ), and you'll be set. When you unpackage the machine you will smell the \"burnt plastic\". But I found that after washing and cycling water by itself, and after a cycle with coffee beans, the smell is barely present (and certainly I do not taste it).",

                "review_text": "I live in a house with 3 other adults, so in the five months since I purchased this machine it's gotten plenty of use (nearly a full pot every day; sometimes two) and has been quite reliable. To my knowledge, we've all been using the strong brew setting, and the coffee tastes fine (as good as you can expect from an inexpensive coffee maker), though I'm curious to test some people's claim that the normal setting will actually brew a stronger cup of coffee -- I'll admit I haven't tried brewing coffee on the normal setting. On days when I don't have to be anywhere early, I usually prefer taking the extra time to prepare a French press, unless one of the others in the house have already brewed a full pot (which is most of the time). Come to think of it, I haven't heard a single complaint from them about the machine, so take that as a thumbs up from 4 different people. The brew timer is a lifesaver for days when I need to wake up exceptionally early and might not have the time or energy to brew coffee in the morning. The only real issues I've had are just related to getting used to the machine. As others have mentioned, the coffee maker will produce a volume of coffee that is less than the amount you put into the reservoir, most likely due to evaporation. To solve this, I just add an extra half to full cup of water, depending on the size of the pot I'm brewing. I think the water filtration disc that goes above the brew basket may likely impact the amount of evaporation that occurs, so I tend to not use it, since I can just put filtered water in the reservoir anyway. (Honestly I think the quality of the local tap water is pretty good, but there are large mineral deposits, so I consider adding filtered water to the reservoir to be more essential than using the water filtration disc, especially as far as machine maintenance goes.) The other issue is also something mentioned by others -- that is, coffee spillage when trying to pour a cup of coffee with the lid down. When your brain hasn't yet met its full potential due to lack of coffee, remembering to lift the lid can be challenging. Even so, I think this is a minor issue. Overall, I've had a good experience with this machine and can recommend it if you're looking for a coffee-maker on a budget.",

After a good bit of research we settled on this Mr. Coffee model and we have been so pleased that we did. For a very reasonable price we got higher-end features like a water filter and moving \"shower head-style\" system which spreads the water over the beans evenly, producing a tastier cup of coffee. No weird plastic taste like some of the more inexpensive coffee pots have, a generous carafe (we chose the glass one) and it is very easy to set up and use the first time. Love the timer feature - waking up to freshly brewed coffee beats a groggy walk/drive to Starbucks any day. Would buy again and definitely recommend.",

We experienced no plastic taste. Directions are easy to understand, no leaks, no messes that others claim was a problem. We've operated the maker on both the normal-brew and heavy-brew settings, and there is a taste difference. Since we all have our own taste, you be the judge. (and we found we use a little less dry coffee between the two settings) The only issue (at first) is the clock is not back-lit. When we first set the clock and timer, they were tough to see. Once set though, we haven't had to reset them and quite frankly we don't need another clock in our kitchen anyway since there's the oven clock and the microwave clock and our stupid smartphones have clocks and who cares what time it is anyway.

The water gauge is on the side toward the back so you need to shift the pot to see it and the top opens to the side instead of from the front. This means you need to shift the position of the coffeemaker when filling it with water.The price of the coffeemaker plus the extra stainless carafe which is purchased separately was so much less than most coffeemakers(about $50). Great coffee and a bargain besides. The coffee is great and since I use the stainless carafe there is never a burnt taste and I save on electricity.",

Five stars if you could turn off the beeper. Avoid this coffee maker if you have a dog. Who thinks that a non-optional beeping noise early in the morning is a good idea? Don't try this unless you don't care about the warranty and are confident in taking your life into your own hands -- unplug the thing first!!! I was able to remove the beeper myself by removing six plugs hiding screws inside the water door -- they don't look like plugs, but look for the screw towers. The plugs can be removed by gently prying with a jeweler's screwdriver. The rest of the procedure is pretty obvious. A similar process is documented here: http://mongolianquill.net/2011/10/disable-the-obnoxious-beeping-on-a-mr-coffee-model-jwx27/",

But the coffee tastes good, it's easy to use, and has been reliable. The only thing I don't like about it is the shiny chrome trim, which my husband and I keep saying we're going to take a steel wool pad to so that it will be a brushed finish (haven't done it yet). The chrome is too bright, and I like my appliances to sort of fade into the background.",

I love the option of the regular or strong brew (I use strong anyway), the automatic starter for when you don't want to make the coffee when you wake up, and the shut-off time. It's also helpful if someone in your household is in a rush and needs to pour their coffee in their travel mug; it stops dripping when you pull the carafe out so you can send someone along their way, happily caffeinated. Another bonus is being able to pour water in the reserve without it leaking down the outside of the carafe. It was so annoying! This one lets you pour out 12 cups of water into the reserve without one drop spilling onto your countertops, and you can pretty much just dump the water in as quickly as you need to (just be careful where you aim)! Mr. Coffee is the way to go. I have a feeling we will have this for YEARS before we need to replace it.",

It does seem to make the coffee taste a little better with the chlorine removed. I probably won't continue to use it and buy replacement filters when the month of use is over, however, as our water taste is good without filtration. The controls are easy and intuitive. It is a bonus to have a \"Strong\" option. I am usually in to big a hurry to use it, and the coffee made the regular way tastes good. The only downside is that the water amount viewer is only on the right side due to the design. For me the left side view would have been better. It is a minor inconvenience to have to look around to that side for me, not enough to lower the rating. The optional carafe is a bonus for any one who would want to purchase that.",

The other, more expensive one I wanted was on backorder everywhere , so I settled for this one (my runner up). For the price point, it is great. Has all of the features you actually need and use. I think the only thing it lacks (that I've noticed so far) is the ability to set different times for the auto on programmable feature. I believe some of the more expensive models have this option. With this one, you can only preset one time. However, since it pauses when the carafe is removed...it isn't a big deal to wait for the first cup to be made if you need to wait till you actually get up to turn it on. The only downside is that you MUST set the time as soon as you turn it on. Otherwise, it will automatically set to 12:00 and you have to set your programmed time based on that. I learned this the hard way. The only way I found to reset the clock was to leave it unplugged overnight. This means when daylight savings time hits you can't easily/quickly fix the clock.",

That actually kept me from buying it, but when the price dropped to next-to-nothing over the holidays, I decided to take the plunge. We should have bought this thing years ago. It makes great coffee, albeit slightly on the strong side of the spectrum. We actually use less coffee than we needed with our prior machine to get the taste just right. The trick is that this machine preheats the water more than others, extracting as much coffee goodness from the grounds as possible. We haven't had any issues with odd smells or tastes. It just makes great coffee which is what everyone wants, right? The only negative is that the preheating creates a lot of steamy condensation inside the machine, so when you open it after a brew to toss the grounds, condensation droplets from the lid can make a mess on your countertop. I should also note that the process of priming the water filter before use takes a lot of water. I'm not 100% sure if the water filter actually enhances the taste, but we've been using it.",

The filter is a little gimmicky feeling to me, and sort of a hassle to use. It just sits on top of the basket and you have to take it off to fill with grounds, and put it back on to brew.

What was very impressive for this unit was that the coffee comes out very HOT and it's great because it's hotter than any other coffee maker I've had. The brew is much better with hotter water as well. I usually add one less scoop of coffee for the total cups of water I add. So 8 cups of water I add 7 scoops of coffee. You will have to experiment couple time. The only thing that would be nice is a meter or a counter to let you know when to change the charcoal water filter. I'll have to future out where to buy it as well when i comes to that point.",

Like the previous model, the lid, when raised, means this does not fit underneath cabinets, if that is an issue.

I would definitely recommend this machine. I would also recommend the permanent filter, it makes loading the grounds a lot easier. Some have mentioned slow brew times. I've owned a few different Mr. Coffee's and one Cuisinart and I'd say they are all fairly comparable in that regard. This machine can be set to start on a timer so worst case you can program it to start brewing based on whatever time you wake up in the morning.",

I love the programmable feature, so it was ready for whoever woke first and especially the auto shut off - yes, I always forget to turn it off.

Middle of the night, internet out, can't sleep... wonderful... The new coffee maker was set up and ready for its trial run. I hit the power, turned the strength setting to strong and waited. I started regretting the choice almost immediately because of the wait and thought of one of the machines that keeps the water hot and on hand. Then I remembered the timer and realized that this point would be moot if I had regular sleep patterns. Anyway... I poured the first cup, mixed it up to my taste and WOW!!! What flavor!!! I was so happy, I un-grumped and actually found the problem with my wiring at 3AM. Internet up! Day 2 just as good. Heading down to grab some more.

                "review_text": "I'm giving this product 4 stars, mostly because despite the great performance my new coffee machine gave, the charcoal filter that is supposed to filter out garbage in the water, I feel is a scam just to bring in higher numbers in sales. Had this worked the way it was advertised, I might have thought differently. I bought this unit, to replace an older model that did not have the charcoal filter option because some of it's parts needed replacing, and the total cost was just not worth it. The part of the coffee filter latch in my old model, despite proper cleaning, was getting stuck, which would cause the machine while making coffee, to over flow and the mess it made all over the counter of coffee grinds and coffee, told me it was time for a new machine. Unfortunately, the new model has the same latch in the filter cup, so make sure to clean it regularly and remove the filter hairs that tend to wrap around the latch spindle, or it will start jamming and cause the same mess my old machine did. As for the charcoal filter, it's a waste of money. I have made 3 pots of coffee so far using it. You would think, at least after breaking it in the first time, that replaceable filter would perform properly. It didn't. Watch when you make the first pot, and second, and third, as the how water goes from the spout into the coffee filter through the charcoal filter, instead of the water going completely through, it builds up faster then it can strain, then just pours over the top right into the coffee filter below. Moment it does this, and so far 3 times in a row it had, it defeats the purpose. There is one benefit to the charcoal filter holder though. If you choose not to waste money on the charcoal filter, at least use the holder. I noticed when placed properly, it helps prevent the coffee filter itself from folding over. Remember those days your in a rush to get to work, or get your kids to school, hoping for a nice hot cup of coffee, to find it full of coffee grinds, because the filter despite placing it correctly, would sometimes fold over on one side, allowing grinds to go over and into the coffee pot? This charcoal filter holder keeps the filter up and basically stops the filter from falling over. But it also can cause it to fold over if you place it incorrectly, so be careful. The machine works just as good as the old model. Everything works just about the same. You just got to get used to the buttons getting reversed. As I said above, this would be 5 stars except for the charcoal filter scam.",

After 3 weeks it had not arrived. I had received no tracking information so sent email to vendor. I received an automated reply that the vendor was no longer with Amazon.

                "review_text": "We live in a city with horrible tasting water. The extra filter makes a HUGE difference in the taste of the coffee. This was purchased as an early Christmas gift for my husband, and I happened to catch it on sale. I saw no reason to buy the thermal carafe, as it only holds 8 cups of coffee, and he drinks 12 cups on his own pretty quickly. Our nearly four year old son loves all the lights and the fact that it beeps when it's finished. The coffeemaker looks very nice in our kitchen. The only possible con that I could think of is that because of the direction the lid opens, to pour water in the reservoir, we have to pull it out from under the cabinet. Older versions opened another direction, which made it easier to pour water into it. All that said, that's absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things, and certainly not enough to take it down a rating star. The coffeemaker shuts off after two hours, so you do not have to worry about it burning the coffee. The carafe sets into the housing so it leaves less surface area for little hands to reach up and get burned. It has a timer for delayed brewing, and you can make strong or regular coffee. My husband is a fan of both. The coffee does not come out so hot that it will burn you but it is also not too cool. The recommended number of scoops of coffee per cup of water is not to his personal taste, but that is absolutely a matter of each individual's personal preference. We're VERY happy with the product.",

First off I have to say it is much more attractive then what I expected. People have already commented on that. One thing that surprised me was that a lot of steam did not come pouring out from the top of it while the coffee was brewing. May not be a big deal for some but my last two pots always had a lot of steam coming out.The coffee is nice & hot. One of my favorite features is the 2 hour shut-off feature. Personally I didn't really notice too much of a difference in the strength of the coffee when I selected \"strong brew\". I would have preferred that the clock would be illuminated, Definitely miss that feature. I have to slide the coffeemaker out from under the cabinet to prepare it & I was pleasantly surprised that it slid very easily. All around I find that I am very pleased with this purchase & the price was very affordable.",

I had a hard time figuring out how to set the delay because i lost my instructions (by the way you have to set it, and then turn the coffee maker on and off, and then the delay light will come on meaning it's set) but you can google this coffee maker's name and there are YouTube videos of people setting it. I used to use a Chemex, and I got tired of the difficulty of making more than 2 cups of coffee in a single go, and didn't really feel like I was getting coffee that tasted that much better (yes, I am aware there are techniques for doing it right), but in my busy/lazy life, a regular old press-one-button-and-voila-coffee set up is much much more practical. Plus, the fact that machine keeps the coffee warm after I walk away is also a god-send. So here's to waking up at 6am and having a warm, strongish cup of coffee ready for you!",

I love that I can get my first cup from it while it is still brewing (delay feature, I think it is called). It has a nice, wide area for pouring the water into the reservoir which is handy. My only complaints are that it is a bit noisy as it brews - it makes loud gurgling sounds until it is finished. And the heating surface seems to get extremely hot, altho' it has not adversely affected the flavor of the coffee.",

                "review_text": "Update 9/8/15: Consumer Reports magazine no longer recommends this coffeemaker because it no longer heats water reliably to the temperature required (195\u00b0 to 205\u00b0 F for five to six minutes) to nominally extract flavor from coffee grounds: \"Because the new models of the Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT no longer measure up, it is dropping in our Ratings from a recommended model to lower in the pack.\" Update 1/24/15 - after 2 years of daily use: LCD clock display has not failed due to condensation on its face. Impressive! Filter clogging with colossal spillage over rim of basket - never happened. No hint of plastic smell/taste after the first few brews: There was some when first used, but no more after that. Never had a mildew smell. Only big change is that the warming plate at base is corroding / turning brown. But I have a Cuisinart that does that, too. Conclusion: unit is working the same as when new. Totally satisfied. If it dies tomorrow, I'd buy another without delay - unless of course I saw better reviews for a different unit. Thanks all for your helpful comments! Original review December 2012: After using this Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT coffeemaker for a week, I thought I would attempt to address some of the complaints that other reviewers had on this coffeemaker. Some of the complaints are valid, others, well, it seems like they're describing a different unit altogether, or at the very least a defective one or a different production run than mine. Here we go: 1. Coffee overflowing out of the basket and into the reservoir and out to the countertop: I did not experience this. This could theoretically happen if one were to accidentally use 2 paper filters, which could reduce the rate of coffee going through the basket, which would then create an overflow situation. This scenario would not be limited to this coffeemaker, then. Overflow could also happen if one were to accidentally allow grounds to go into or remain in the plastic basket, which could clog it. Again, not particular to this coffeemaker. Could also happen if the carafe were incorrectly placed in the coffeemaker: not likely at all (see below). 2. Length of brew time too long: No reviewers stated how many minutes per batch, or how many cups and minutes per batch. This unit seemed to take a reasonable amount of time - the same amount of time that my Cuisinart maker takes. 3. Brewed coffee not hot enough: Using a good candy thermometer, I measured the temperature of a brewed pot of coffee (while in its glass carafe) immediately after brewing: 175 degrees. Scalding hot. Temperature dropped to 155 degrees within 5 minutes. Suggestion: to keep your coffee hot, move coffee to a hot-charged, insulated carafe immediately after brewing. 4. Plastic smell while brewing, plastic taste of brewed coffee: I definitely got the strong plastic smell with the first couple of water-only \"prep\" no-coffee brew cycles, and a bit less with the first few coffee cycles. This smell is no longer present after 6 days of use. Plastic taste: I did notice a slight plastic aftertaste with the first few coffee batches, but no longer. I suppose I may have gotten used to it, or it is no longer happening, or a combination of both. I think that it is the latter case. 5. Coffee leaks from basket onto the warming plate while using \"pause and serve\" feature (sneaking a cup of coffee during brewing cycle): I saw two or three drops of coffee go onto the warming plate: not too bad. Quick swipe with a damp paper towel keeps the plate clean. Not a defect. 6. Warming plate not hot enough, no temperature setting for plate: I do not use the warming plate - my coffee goes directly from the pot to an insulated carafe right after brewing. Applied post-brewed heat is the enemy of brewed coffee. The longer you keep your brewed coffee on *any* warming plate - regardless of temperature - the worse it will taste. 7. Correct carafe placement onto warming plate is difficult and likely to cause basket overflow: Despite my best, repeated efforts, I could not *incorrectly* place the pot onto the plate. The pot placed itself into its home 100 percent of the time. The only way I could get it to *not* place itself correctly was to barely balance it on the front edge of the maker, which was difficult in itself. 8. LCD Clock display not illuminated: True. A definite shortcoming of this unit, especially considering this is a programmable unit. A missed necessity. 9. Condensation on clock and buttons on front operating panel: True. Could have long-term reliability consequences. 10. Water spout not positioned properly over grounds: Impossible! The closure of the unit's lid forces (rotates) the spout into the correct position - that is of course unless one does not close the lid. 11. Filter paper collapse and fold-over onto grounds in basket, causing clog and overspill: It could happen, since I have experienced this with other drip makers. Not particular to this unit, then. 12. 2 hours post-brew auto-shutoff - too soon?: Nope. Coffee cooking for 2 hours on a warming plate would taste horrible. Want hot coffee two hours later? Move it from the pot to an insulated carafe directly after completion of brewing cycle. I would actually prefer that there were no warming unit on this machine. 13. Power cord length too short: It measures exactly 24 inches from the back middle of the unit to the male power plug. Dealbreaker? Not for many, I'm guessing. 14. Water filter placement onto top of brewing basket is difficult: Agreed. Must be done carefully. I chose to not use the filter at all, since I use purified water already. Plus, by not using the water filter, it's one more step I don't need to perform. Hot water seems to distribute nicely onto grounds without it - all of the grounds in the basket are soaking wet after the brewing cycle is complete. 15. Amount of coffee brewed is much less than amount of water used: After multiple 8-cup water brews, I consistently yielded 7.75 cups per batch. That's about 3 percent water loss to evaporation. Insignificant. Any more loss than that, then there must be some other cause at play. I could not cajole my unit to lose any more water than was lost to evaporation. 16. Condensation of water in reservoir after brewing creates musty or mildew smell: It could happen in theory. I leave the lid open after brewing for a while to avoid this possibility. Again, this scenario would not be limited to this unit. 17. Reliability after several months: Unknown. Only had it a week. 18. Amount of coffee needed to produce a given coffee strength: My unit yields similar strength as on my Cuisinart maker given the same amount of grounds/water/grind fine-ness. Summary: It seems that some of the complaints are totally unrealistic (IMHO), but others are totally valid. I hope this helps!",

The absence of any smell resembling coffee while brewing or when holding the cup to my lips is extremely odd to me. The absence of coffee taste, either brewed to regular or strong strength is strange. Mr Coffee has been making these machines for 300 years, so I would have thought they'd perfected the craft by now. I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews, and the price. I have run through at least 6 cycles of vinegar and water, with each of those cycles followed by 2 fresh water cycles. Nothing I have done has eliminated the scent of a hot rubber hose. I have brewed a few pots of a hot liquid with many of the same apparent properties as coffee, but it smells and tastes like water that was run through a hot rubber hose. I really do not like to give up easily, and am on my 7th cycle. I am honestly a little hesitant to waste another few scoops of tasty ground beans on this device, but holding out some hope that the awful smell and taste can be neutralized. One other thing to mention is that the smell is evident when only water is run through the system, the problem is evident by simply sniffing under the cover (after the steam clears). I don't know if the one I received was made from a different batch, or a substituted rubber hose, or something that otherwise distinguishes this one from the others sold. I like fresh coffee, but hardly think I am such a snob that I am being overly picky. Just perplexed right now.... UPDATE....I found an alternative solution in some obscure corner of the interweb, and it actually worked fabulously. Somebody suggested rubbing down the interior with alcohol. He had experimented and concluded that the yucky plastic residue is soluble in vodka. First, I removed the tube that carries the hot water/steam and ran it through the dishwasher. Then, I wiped down the interior with about a shot of vodka on a paper towel. I also left a small amount in the bottom of the reservoir overnight to saturate the part of the tube that was inaccessible. Amazingly, it worked. I raised my rating from 1 star to 3. I have not had it long enough to provide a longerm review, and the stink and rotten taste was a major problem that should not be an expected part of a purchase, in my opinion. But, I am content now.",

This coffee maker has rave reviews from those who did not get one with all that nasty chemical smell, both on Amazon and at other sites on the web. One customer review I read suggested perhaps the units were made at different locations. Hence the evidence that some of these coffee makers are fine and others have that horrible chemical smell, which by the way, I could not get rid of. Coffee brewed through the coffee maker after cleaning it with vinegar and running several complete cycles of clean water through it still smelled and tasted of whatever chemical is infused into the plastic. So, I rolled the dice hoping to get one of these that didn't have the chemicals, and lost. The coffee maker itself is a really good unit. But, if you get one where the plastic.(and all of the working parts through which water used to make coffee passes, are plastic) is infused with whatever chemical is causing the smell, then I doubt anyone would want it.

When I first bought it, I scoffed at the suggestion of a \"service plan\" thinking, these things last forever! You have to sneak them out of the house when hubby isn't looking just to get something a little more modern looking. The jokes on me as it seems it was built to break",

Prior to this purchase, I bought another mr. Coffee at Costco which also stopped working 2 months.

Deceptive marketing tactics on the quantity of coffee this unit makes. Mr. Coffee advertises that this unit will make 12 cups of coffee however it will only hold approximately 52 ounces of water. Either Mr. Coffee doesn't know how many ounces are in a cup or they redefined it to be 4.33 ounces per cup. Even their box shows that they have changed this to 6 ounces for a cup and not the standard 8 ounce per cup. Aside from deceptive marketing, the clock is a small LCD clock with a gray background and black lettering which is recessed deep into the unit. You have to view this clock straight on or you will not be able to see it. Setting the time and brew times proves to be difficult because of this design. The final problem that I find with this coffee maker is the way they've designed the water reservoir. It traps massive amounts of condensation inside the unit and this concerns me about bacterial growth.. Overall, I would not recommend this coffee maker if other alternative products are available.",

In actuality, it is a step backwards, in as much as their designers chose to put Design over Functionality. All of my previous programmable coffee makers had a LIGHTED ANALOG CLOCK and I thought that this one would have a lighted digital clock. Also, the designers failed, when they moved the reservoir water level marker, to the right side of the coffee maker. Now, you must depend on the accuracy of the markings on the decanter as the markings on the reservoir are out of view, It makes a good cup of coffee, but so did my old one's and it did not have the same bulk or shortcomings of this one. Had I realized it's short comings, I would never have made the purchase. I called Mr Coffee about these failures and looked at their web site, only to find that this particular model is NOT shown in their inventory, other than in Red and the suggested lighted models,were not shown either.

This is just simple stupid deign. Other parts of the machine are lit, so why not backlight the clock so one can read it? I'm not a designer and I can figure that out. I needed a coffee maker and it was a busy time of year so I did not return it. Every day I curse the person who designed this so you could not read the time unless you were hunched over the counter and staring at the clock on this thing. It also tiny and I need my glasses to read it, but I don't blame them for that, although, what would it t=have taken to make the clock s smidge bigger?

I've since ran two gallons of vinegar and a bottle of vodka through (each followed by water to flush out the vinegar/vodka) and there is still a faint smell of plastic to it. I'm going to run vinegar through it one more time, followed by water a couple times. If I can still taste plastic in my tea after that, I will return it. Save yourself some trouble and spend a bit more on a better coffee maker. I should have, between the vodka, vinegar, and time invested in trying to get this usable, I could have had a really nice coffee maker. *UPDATE* I was finally able to use this coffee maker for what I bought it for. After three gallons of vinegar, a bottle of vodka, probably 30 total cycles to rinse the vodka or vinegar out, it still smelled like plastic. I ran two cycles of tea each time and poured them out after completion. I then made a pot of tea that finally did not taste like plastic. Be warned, the coffee machine still smells faintly of plastic. I still would not recommend this product. Spend a litlte more money and buy a better coffee maker.",

I also liked the programmable feature and the sleek look of the coffee pot. It's easy enough to set up and use. Unfortunately, as with most products these days outsourced to China - this coffee maker was not made to be quality. I would expect a 40 dollar coffee maker to last more than six months before completely giving up. It was starting to leak almost immediately - first just a few drops under the maker, then within a few months, a little puddle underneath it every time we made coffee. I am so sick of products that were once good declining in quality and never price. We had a Mr. Coffee maker before this that lasted a few years. the last two now have had issues so I am all done with this brand and will seek out something more durable with the same features.",

                "review_text": "Good coffee pot for every day but I found two flaws. First let me tell you that I purchased this coffee pot in October of 2015. The first few brewing cycles it smelled a little found inside but I didn't find it to change the flavor of my coffee. After maybe 3 or 4 cycles it was already gone. So when you open it don't be alarmed. There's nothing wrong with it. Brew your coffee a few times and you'll get over it. Some \"perks:\" it brews quickly, coffee is very hot which is great (once you add cold milk it's still tasty hot coffee), extremely easy to use, looks great on the counter and is programmable. I use it every day and it takes a beating and it's holding up marvelously. The directions on the bags of coffee I have and the water tank are pretty accurate. You may want to adjust how much coffee grounds you are going to use depending on the strength you want but it doesn't take much to figure out and that's with any coffee and coffee pot anyway. Flaws: It shuts off after two hours. You have no control over that. I'd like it to be three hours because I drink my coffee slowly and not everyone in my house wakes up at the same time but whatever. Secondly, it gets VERY dirty- inside the water tank, the basket and inside the area around the basket all gets a coffee buildup of some sort. It's disgusting. I have to clean it often inside. Lastly and MOST IMPORTANTLY, after doing a cleaning today I found wires sticking out from underneath the rim where the water drips through into the coffee pot. If the wires were to break I could have a fire I think. Therefore, until I get a new coffee pot in a few days, I won't be using this anymore because I'm too scared for my safety. I took a video but I can't figure out how to post it. Recap: keep it if you don't see wires sticking out of yours. Otherwise, skip it and buy something else!",

Did everything in the user manually and finally called the help desk. The auto response system took way too long (4 min) and the fourth option on their auto response is \"won't brew\" (find that funny). Then the auto response tells me to clean the coffee maker by brewing it with vinegar.... c'mon guys... it won't brew!! After 4 minutes, got a prompt to ask for a Representative. The Representative was AMAZING. She asked me a few simple questions, and hurray they are shipping me a brand new machine! The part I feel bad about it filling up a landfill with this old one.

Note that only R.O water is ever used in it. I do agree that it is messy when opening lid as it drops condensation which gets around past the stopper and onto the burner or falls outside the sides, but I keep a towel handy to wipe up when refilling. I like that it allows for a hotter brew and rely on the 2 hour time-out and gentle reminder if I need to restart. The problem lies with build quality. I had my unit for 6 months and it stopped brewing. I read the reviews and see this quite common. As an engineer and ex-electrician I decided to look into the problem as I did not have time to do without while shipping it for warranty repairs. First thing I noticed was that as I opened the bottom that there was a rattle coming from a loose internal screw. Looked around and could not verify where it was from so I chalk it up to a bonus they provided, kind of like when you find a bug in your food and consider it free extra protein. I was concerned that the electronics may be bad but that was not the case as I heard the relay click when trying to start it. A little probing with the power off and using a multi-meter showed that one of the thermal cutout fuses was open. Seeing no potential damage, as well as the fact that the second fuse was still intact, meaning that it was more likely a bad fuse than an actual over temperature condition, I did some research and found replacement fuses (at Amazon), although I did have to buy five and only needed one. After a 2-day prime shipment, and cutting out the old and crimping in the new with trimmed down stak-on lugs and the pot is fully operational again. Also note that there are many you-tube videos to help if you have basic repair capabilities and weigh the risk that this is a safety item. So 2 stars is what it gets for good features but bad manufacturing. There is no way a consumer item should have such a short MTBF.",

So, don't expect it to last a heck of a long time, I guess they just don't make them like they used to. The flat water filter it uses is a joke. Water can't hardly pass through it, so it usually just spill over the sides of the disc and into the grounds. I replaced it once and the new one did the same thing, so I just tossed it altogether (I have well water, so I don't really have a need for it anyway). Also, the clock is slightly fast on it. If you want it to match the other clocks on your kitchen appliances (and be accurate) then you'll have to adjust it every couple of months.

It takes almost 8 minutes to make a 10 cup pot of coffee, this thing is really slow compared to other coffee makers I have had. Also has others have said this coffee maker has a very strong plastic smell. I ran several pots of water through the machine and it still taste like plastic so I am returning it, this is a piece of junk.",

The inside has fill levels for glass or metal carafes which is nice for using unmarked containers to fill but you must be looking directly down into the fill chamber. The water arm swings clear making filling easier to hit the opening than my previous top fill. The water arm takes a little practice to make sure it is in the correct place for brewing. My complaints are that the previous model had a lighted analog style clock that was a nightlight and easy to read and the new maker's clock is not lighted and deeply recessed, while surrounded with shiny chrome making the clock almost useless to see due to glare. It's a little annoyance but I use the clock a lot. I also don't think it was mentioned that the clock is unlit in the product description either. I also purchased the stainless carafe and the coffee maker senses whether you put in the 12 cup glass or 8 cup metal carafe and turns off the bottom heater for metal. The entire lid has to swing open to one side to fill so you cannot fill it under a low upper cabinet without pulling it out.",

After you added creamer, it was just warm. So we purchased this one after looking around a lot, and when it came, we were really pleased with it. After 4 days of working perfectly and delivering fresh, hot coffee, it started making the WORST noise ever, like that bubbling, gurgling sound of someone finishing a drink through a straw. The clock area also started to steam up, making the clock impossible to read. It stayed that way for over a week. My main concern with that was mold. After that, we noticed that the steam coming from the back of the machine caused the paint on the wall behind it to crack, blister, and peel off. This is a brand new house, construction was finished in October of 2016. This is ridiculous. Finally, to add insult to injury, the \"brewing finished\" beep sounds right after the machine starts to brew, instead of when it's actually finished brewing.",

Because of this issue, the basket raises up when the decanter is placed into the machine. The reason for this is that the basket's valve (at the bottom) is spring loaded and the top of the decanter pushes the basket up rather that opening the spring loaded valve. If the manufacturer simply put a tongue in groove tab at the front of the basket so that this point is held firmly in place, then possibly the shower head can hold the back side of the basket in place. Even that solution though requires that there is a tighter fit between the shower head and the basket. As a confirmation to my premise, I was able to easily rig the basket to stay in place by using two spring clips, one in front & one at the rear of the basket. I sent both devices back though because the product should never have been placed on the market in this state.",

It's roughly two years old at this point, and should still work. I bought a Mr. Coffee, because I am of the mindset that it is a quality coffee maker. I was hoping to get 5-10 years of use out of it before replacing, so imagine my surprise when without warning, it just stopped working. I'm waiting on my replacement which we ordered two days ago (yes, another Mr. Coffee--because I foolishly bought a 5-10 year supply of the charcoal disk type water filters for this machine, thinking, optimistically I'd get a lot of use out of this coffee maker). If this machine dies a premature death, I'm going to go back to a Krups, or perhaps a Braun. Much in the way Maytag used to be a name associated with quality, I had a similar mindset about Mr. Coffee--now my faith in the brand is, shall we say, LACKING. CAVEAT EMPTOR. (Original Review, 2015) When it was time to give my old Krups its funeral, I was glad I bought this to replace it. Sleek. Programmable. User friendly. Easy to clean. Produces a great pot of coffee. Great value for all these bells and whistles. Now *if only* the machine would load ITSELF! with the coffee grinds and water the night before--then I'd be in heaven:)",

The product looks as pictured and it certainly looks nice on my counter. But that's the only good thing I can say for this model. For starters, it's overly complicated to use: - Filling it requires pulling the unit to the edge of counter as the cover is very tall and can't open under any cabinets. - Water filling area is small - so don't miss (which is pretty easy to do). - You have to get both the basket and the water filter situated JUST RIGHT >> If you use the water filter disk, the water just pours down the middle, leaving the edges of the grounds semi dry and not brewed correctly. So I'm wasting a ton of money in extra grounds. If you DON'T use the water filter disk, the coffee filter falls in on itself and much of the grounds end up either clogging the \"pause and pour\" stopper or the grounds end up in the carafe. Huge design flaw, IMO. - Plus, the dang thing leaks water (tried making a smaller pot 3 days ago. . .. about 3/4 cup of plain water was under the unit. \"superduper\" >:-( At first, I thought I may have \"missed\" when filling the water reservoir - but I was very watchful the next day (confirmed no misses on my part) but it still leaked. I tried to return it, but I can't it's over the 30 day limit (I've used it less than 20 times but I should have opened the box and started using it right away. My bad.). Live and learn. I'll never buy another one of these again. So disappointed in this product. Grrrrr....",

I use standard coffee grounds, but the water drips onto the grounds slowly, and even then the basket fills up and sometimes takes up to twenty minutes to drain into the pot. I've taken the coffee maker apart and cleaned out the tubing, so I know it's not clogged. I've tried it with the permanent filter, with a paper filter, with the permanent filter on top of a paper filter, and with a paper filter inside the permanent filter, but to no avail. It still takes a very long time. Also, the coffee maker doesn't evenly saturate the grounds, so I often feel compelled to open the cover and stir the coffee while it's steeping (instead of draining). That's a pain that I shouldn't have to do. Coffee DOES taste better when I do this. I also wish someone could explain to me what the button for \"Strong\" or \"Normal\" actually does. Does the water get hotter? Does the water drip more slowly? What does that setting do that affects how strong the coffee is? Without a backlight on the clock, it's practically worthless as it can't be read unless very very close. I suspect that once I find a new coffee maker, Goodwill shall be the recipient of this one.",

During the 6 months that it worked, I have no real complaints other than the fact that the clock is not backlit on this model, which I really miss from our last one. We owned the previous model for about 9 YEARS before it failed. Mr. Coffee clearly is not making the same quality products these days. I am going to see what my options are with the 1-year warranty. Hopefully I do not have to pay for shipping, but if I do, I will not bother repairing it and will never purchase another Mr. Coffee product again. UPDATE 5/21/17: I received a replacement machine at no cost, which has worked fine until today. We have the same issue! The lights turn on when I try to start the brewing cycle, but nothing brews and the warming plate doesn't heat up. Very disappointed as we are no longer under warranty.

After following Mr. Coffee instructions to run a couple of pots of only water through the machine, the first few pots that I brewed came out fine. However, soon my wife and I started noticing a terrible chemical plastic taste in the coffee. I had read that others who had purchased the same model Mr. Coffee coffee maker had encountered the same problem if terrible tasting coffee, but unfortunately didn't heed these negative ratings, given many other positive ratings. It's hard to believe that anybody would find this plastic-tasting coffee to be acceptable, so I have to conclude that Mr. Coffee purchases its plastic raw materials from various providers in China, where just about everything sold by Amazon is made. So it appears that you take a gamble buying products made in China. I can't return the coffee maker to Amazon for reimbursement because I had had it delivered to a family member's apartment in Chicago where my wife and I were visiting, and Amazon's product return software will only print a return label for UPS with the original address listed as the return address. UPS in Costa Rica will only honor a return shipping label if the return address (i.e. the address to where the originally purchased product was delivered) printed on the label is in Costa Rica. To have Amazon ship a product to Costa Rica involves paying for import and custom services that make the shipping cost more than the item, which is why we buy stuff while visiting in the States to ship back. That essentially makes the Amazon purchase return guarantee worthless.",

Just up and died at the ripe old age of 8 months. Which is fine, sometimes things break, that's why there is a warranty. And that's where I ran into difficulty. I very clearly said the words, \"I am calling for warranty service\" when the agent came on the line. I explained that the coffeemaker wasn't brewing coffee. I was asked to look at the prongs on the power cord - the ones that go into the wall and get scratched up as the unit gets plugged in and unplugged, if it does, and ours does - and then read the letters on the prongs to the agent in order to make sure we're still in warranty. Well, the letters on the prongs were all scratched up, and what I was reading wasn't what the agent wanted to hear. This is getting dumb already. I got put on hold for several minutes as punishment for not providing the right letters. So we finally managed to get past that point and agree that I was in fact covered under warranty because I'd only bought the thing 8 months before. I was then informed that they would register my warranty but only give me 4 more months of protection. Well, obviously...I only expected 4 more months as I had had the thing for 8 months thus far and I knew when I bought it that the warranty period was 12 months. Why are they telling me this? I asked why I was being told this, and I was informed that I had called to register the warranty. No. No, that is not what I said. The exact words I said were, \"I am calling for warranty service\" and I also said the coffemaker wasn't brewing. At this point the agent wanted to argue with me, saying that they \"document all calls\" and the notes they had written thus far said that I had said I was \"calling to register a warranty.\" Oh, my goodness. Now I am getting impatient. *So* not what I said. This person isn't even listening. This is getting ludicrous. I never said the word \"register,\" I never call to register warranties. It's not necessary. I just keep the receipt and if I need service within the warranty period, *then* I call and I'm ready to show proof of when I bought the item. ANYWAY...so then I got put on hold for several more minutes as punishment, again. So we manage to get past THAT, because I indicated that even if I *had* said I was calling to register the warranty - which was NOT what I said - either way the coffeemaker is not brewing coffee. Not a drop. We clean it every month with vinegar like we are supposed to, and I need it fixed or a replacement or whatever it is we do in this situation. I got put on hold again for several minutes, as punishment. I use this time to contemplate my sins. FINALLY the agent takes my address and informs me a new machine is on its way and I can throw away the old one. What should have taken five minutes took over half an hour. The only reason I even want another of the same machine is because I bought extra water filtration discs and I have no way to know what else they might fit. My next coffee maker will be a d@mn Black and Decker. I had no idea they even made kitchen stuff, until I went shopping for a hand mixer one day and I found a Black and Decker hand mixer. Its all black and chrome and shiny and it lives in a MANLY black case and it does an awesome job and ithas lasted for years. And it's MANLY. Black and Decker from now on. Mark my words.

I am rarely this harsh, even in a negative review, but I've been using this brand of coffeemaker for years, since 1980, in fact, and never had I had such a bad experience with any Mr. Coffee model as I have with this one. This coffeemaker, the newest of which I purchased in November of 2015, is sitting on my counter top this morning, and is now nothing but a clicking digital clock. An attractive digital clock, but that's all it is as of 7 am today. AGAIN. Each time one of them has failed, it has been the same thing. I have set it up to make coffee, and all it does it click. The water won't heat, the carafe plate doesn't heat, and of course, no hot water, no coffee. It was working gangbusters the day before, so the failure each time has been without warning. Since this is my THIRD copy of this coffee maker, I'm thinking it's the model. I'm very disappointed. DON'T get this one.",

                "review_text": "Got this to replace an old old Mr. Coffee that came with my house when I moved in. That old simple one made the BEST coffee! But it shorted out one day..... disaster. So I bought this one, and after \"breaking it in\" by running a few cycles with no coffee, it is up to the level of the old one. My secret for GREAT coffee? I NEVER WASH the basket or the pot. HA! You may think this is weird or funny...... but the coffee oils accumulate, and give your coffee the best flavor. I just rinse the pot - no soap..before I fill it, ...and rinse the coffee basket once in a while. No soap! You WANT those oils to enrich your next pot. I make a new pot every day, so nothing is left to get funky. Like someone else here mentioned, I just pour a cup separately and reheat it in the microwave. I don't let it sit on the warmer too long. Try my favorite coffee - French Market Medium Roast. Use 10 cups water to 1 scoop ( I use a scoop from the Whey Protein Powder ) - it's a full shot-glass size scoop. Or a jigger-and-a-half, if you have one of those. That makes some mighty fine java, my friend! Be sure to seat the coffee basket CORRECTLY - it's a little tricky. I find that the \"tab\" should be facing 1 O'clock. And make sure the basket is seated by testing with a push. Before you turn on the machine! The one time I didn't seat it correctly, it didn't allow the water to enter the coffee pot, and made a mess with the grounds and water overflowing inside. But that was MY mistake. Also, I lift the access lid before the pot gets full, to let all the steam that has condensed back into the water chamber. There IS a lot of condensation. No big deal. Makes great coffee! Note- I am amending my review - after using the coffee maker for 3 years, the basket spring is not working, and the coffee overflows and leaks all over the counter, creating a real mess. I guess they just don't make things the way they used to. Buying a different brand. Really, it was nice while it lasted, but I would expect it to last longer than this.",

It's harder to do due to the cabinet above, and water ends up spilling I end up with coffee grounds in my coffee Inconsistent coffee temperature I am disappointed in this machine.

                "review_text": "My name is Michael, and I'm a coffee addict. Coffee-wise, this coffeemaker is everything that \"major consumer magazine\" says it is - it heats the water HOT, its \"strong\" option is handy (although I wish it was the default) and it looks kinda stylish. For $40 or less, you can't get a better cup of coffee. That said, there are a couple of issues with the Mr. Coffee (\"BVMC-SJX33GT\" seems so formal) that you'll want to know before you buy. The primary problem is the seating of the filter basket. It's atrocious. There's nothing to hold it firmly in place, so it \"floats\" as you remove and replace the carafe, even with the lid closed. It also has a spring-mounted \"drip stop\" plug, which is supposed to stop the coffee from flowing when you remove the carafe. Of course, as in all coffeemakers, the coffee is still actually brewing, and you need to replace the carafe in a reasonable amount of time or the filter will overflow. BUT because the filter basket in the Mr. Coffee is not firmly held down, you must make sure the carafe is COMPLETELY seated under it. If you quickly put the carafe under the basket but don't manage to push it all the way back, the plug stays closed and you will return to coffee and grounds on the counter, on the floor, and in every nook and cranny of the coffeemaker itself. Waking up to that will NOT make your day. I've only managed to do that twice in the nearly one year that I've owned it, but I still have to make the conscious effort to push the carafe all the way in, because the one time I don't think about it -- coffee everywhere. But think of it this way: even with the hour of my time I've spent cleaning up after this, I'm still ahead of the $300 I'd have paid for a Technivorm. The other issue is minor but also design-related: condensation on the bottom of the lid. When I flip it up, all the condensation runs back into the filter basket and reservoir (the latter means more frequent cleaning). If the basket and lid were designed better, this would be a 5-star coffeemaker and there would be no reason for a sane person to even consider anything more expensive. But as it stands, for some people its flaws will outweigh the great coffee it's capable of making.",

About the only good things I can say about it is that it makes coffee and the timer works. These are my objections to it: 1. The coffee is not hot. The first cup is usually okay but subsequent cups are just warm. I reheat them in the microwave. 2. It only comes with the chrome front and black top and sides. I don't like chrome fixtures (too hard to keep clean) and would have preferred white. 3. The brew now and delayed brew are controlled by the same button. Press once for brew now and twice for delayed. These should have been separate controls. 4. The water filter is a separate disc that sits on top of the coffee grounds area. Although it seems to do the job it was designed for, it is awkward to have to move and relocate this for each pot of coffee. My previous coffee pot (Cuisinart) had the filter located on the water line and only had to be moved to change the filter. 5. The 12-cup claim is based on a tiny 6-oz cup. The glass pot actually contains more like 7-9 regular size cups and the thermal carafe holds even less. I can usually rely on Consumer Report recommendations, but this time they really let me down. I'd recommend just buying a simple coffee pot with a timer instead of this one.",

After its first month of usage, my coffee maker won't heat consistently. Sometimes it's hot, other times it's lukewarm and I have to reheat it in the microwave.

It's easy to use and I like the functionality (timers, settings) but I have 3 main issues with this machine. 1) I've noticed that if I get a cup right when it's done brewing the coffee it is not hot enough. I have to put my cup in the microwave for 30 seconds. Once it sits on the warmer for a while it does get hot so I just set the timer to make the coffee earlier than I need it. 2) Before I got the gold mesh basket and was just using a paper filter, often, even though I put a full carafe of water into the reservoir I'd only get about a half pot of finished coffee. I discovered that the water was backing up into the machine and realized that the basket with the filter and coffee grounds did not have enough weight (or something) to push the spring down to open the bottom of the basket so the water could drain into the pot. It was a mess! I thought I was going to have to send it back but once I got the gold mesh filter the coffee maker has worked like it is supposed to. The coffee maker's basket does not lock into place like other coffee makers I have owned so if there is not enough pressure in the basket the liquid can't exit through the bottom. 3) This coffee make is noisy and VERY slow. The first time I used it I set it to come on 30 min before I had to get up. I was awakened by what sounded like someone breaking into my house... scared me to death. I got up only to discover it was the coffee maker. It takes this coffeemaker a good 15+ min to make a full pot of coffee...very slow by comparison of other makers I've owned. I've worked around the issues I've had with this machine but I wouldn't buy another one or recommend this one to anyone. Been using this coffee maker almost a year now. Broke the glass carafe last week so tried to order a replacement... Mr. Coffee doesn't make a glass replacement. There is a stainless steel thermos which is more expensive and doesn't hold 12 cups. I ordered a universal fit 12 cup carafe which says it fits my coffee machine but it did not. Perhaps if I had kept the top to the carafe I broke I might have been able to make the replacement carafe work. I can't believe I'll have to buy a new coffee maker just because I broke the glass carafe. One more reason I won't buy another Mr. Coffee anything!",

I cleaned the coffee maker per the manufactures instructions with plain water, then a brew with white vinegar. Then made a couple full pots of coffee with some old decaf I rarely use. Finally I brewed a pot with Starbucks french roast and I can say it made excellent coffee, no plastic taste and very hot! The jury is out on how long the maker will last! Update 11/27/2014: Changed the star rating from 5 to 3-stars! I experienced the plastic taste some of the reviewers have commented about. What I have discovered is if I prepare the coffee the night before, and the water sits in the coffee maker reservoir over night, the coffee has a plastic taste when brewed in the morning. If I pour the water in the reservoir just before brewing, I don't experience the plastic taste. When opening the lid to the reservoir the plastic smell is very strong, I am hoping this will go away in time?",

But now I have to give it one star because this coffee maker stopped working altogether, it died, completely, completely dead, no clock, no lights, no brewing, no nothing, just an empty dead plastic carcass. We have been using it a few times a week to brew 6 cups of coffee per day, it's on the kitchen counter and it has been used in a careful, responsible manner following all the manual instructions, so, there's no reason whatsoever for this appliance to break this way. I called the 1800 MR COFFEE number, after 3 attempts and talking to 3 different people I finally got my warranty recognized and they will be sending me a new one in the next week. I'm really hoping I don't have the same problems again, but because it's under warranty I'll give it a try and see how it works. If it stops working again and dies, I'll just get rid of it and buy a different brand. Crossing my fingers :) ---- OLD REVIEW: I love this coffee maker, I didn't get any of the problems with the \"plastic odor\" some users have been writing about. After reading the instructions on how to clean it and running a whole cycle just with water I started using it right away and it made a great coffee. Very easy to use (please, read the instructions before complaining on how this or that doesn't work) and easier to clean, it looks stylish and beautiful and it works really fast!, I was used to my old coffee maker, and it used to take twice the time to brew some coffee, this one brews it in few minutes and a beep tells you when it's done. I love everything about this piece, and I will definitely buy it again in the future, for me or as a present, because the price is also excellent. I been reading some of the complaints about how to use this piece and most of those problems can get easily fixed by reading the instructions first. There's also tutorials in YouTube if you prefer. Five stars for this coffee maker.",

You cannot turn off the burner during brewing because this unit heats the water by passing it through a rubber hose and then into a metal coil which heated by the hot plate burner. You cannot turn off the burner after doing a timed brew without purchasing the metal carafe for an additional cost (You get around this by placing a magnet at the back of the burner to make the coffee maker sensor think you are using the carafe) 2. The burner and the water get extremely hot which gives the coffee a horrible burned flavor and also causes the burning plastic smell that most of the other reviews mention. I measured the temperature of the burner using an infrared thermometer and it showed over 700 degrees. Everyone knows to make a good cup of coffee you never want the water to go above 200 degrees.",

We have had Mr. Coffee makers in the past and really never had a problem with them. We received this maker and it had the problem of smelling and tasting funny. I did everything, cleaned with white vinegar solution, hand wash as far as I could reach, changed water charcoal filter and even made coffee without the water charcoal filter. After 2 weeks of struggling with this coffee maker, reached Mr. Coffee support. They asked for the letters on the electric plug prongs and after reading them to her, they shipped me a replacement maker. Received the replacement in 1 week and ran the maker through 5 cycles before making the 1st pot of coffee. Had the same taste and smell as the 1st one all though not as strong. We give up. Going back to Black n Decker.",

I don't use this that often, but others in my house do and like it for a big pot of coffee brewed and ready pretty quickly. It's good for when you need coffee for fuel and less for flavor. You're not gonna get nuanced \"berry\" and \"chocolate\" notes out of the coffee you put in this thing. The initial plastic taste is incredibly overwhelming for... a while, but it eventually goes away/lessens. We've had this for a few months, use it 1-3 days per week. The plastic basket for the coffee grinds is also weirdly designed. It has to be placed in exactly *so*, or else it doesn't go down fully and brew correctly. We had a few overflows and figured it out quickly. But jeez, just make it so the basket can get plopped in, not so one nub is precisely at 1 pm. Is it the biggest deal? No, but if you're one of those folks that wants coffee quickly, well, you don't expect to have to clean up your whole counter.",

                "review_text": "Let me first say that the \"strong brew\" feature is not just broken on my pot, it is universally broken. I spoke with Mr. Coffee about it and was informed that this is a known problem with this pot, they're ALL broken, but because not everyone uses the feature they continue to make and sell these. I was actually told that if I wanted a pot with the strong brew feature that I'd need to return this pot and purchase an entirely different model. For a pot that has been in circulation for a few years it astounds me that they haven't fixed this. They did give me the standard disclaimer, \"we're working on a fix\". With that said, I bought this pot based solely on the fact that Consumer Reports rates this pot very highly, because reviews here are mixed. At this price ($24) I figured I'd try it. I was replacing an older Cuisinart DCC-1200 which has given me years of good use until recently. My first impression was how cheap this unit seemed, both in fit and finish. I mean, I expect consumer electronics to be cheaply made nowadays, but this was really something. The filter basket just rests in the maker, so when the pot is in place the spring that is supposed to \"close\" the filter basket actually lifts the basket up and out of place. This is hard to explain in text, but my Cuisinart filter basket actually clipped in place to prevent this problem. This is just one example of the poor quality, I could list more. As a person who really goes through a lot of coffee I was quickly able to determine the good and bad of this pot. I typically brew 2-3 12 cup pots a day, using the thermal carafe on this unit that increased since the thermal carafe only holds 8 cups. I did like some of the features, but there was nothing new or innovative about them to set them apart from other machines. Mine did have a bad plastic smell/taste even after running 6 or so pots through it to clean it, but after a few more pots that went away and wasn't a problem again. The thermal carafe did an ok job of holding the coffee warm if I pre-heated it with hot water before actually brewing coffee into it. The design of the lid for the thermal carafe was really \"clunky\" (for lack of a better word). It screws down onto the pot and it was oddly difficult to get the threads started without it wanting to cross-thread. When it came time to pour coffee a half-turn of the lid would let coffee out but SO SLOWLY. The lid is also equipped with what is supposed to be a \"one way\" valve, but since it's gravity operated it opens when pouring and, with a full pot, you end up with coffee coming out of 2 places at once. To get the last cup of coffee out of the pot you had to remove the lid entirely and basically turn the carafe upside down. I could go on, but I won't. The only reason I give this pot 2 stars is because, at the end of the day, it did make an OK cup of coffee. My biggest problems were with the quality of the unit, the thermal carafe (which is a separate purchase), and my biggest issue - the broken \"strong brew\" setting that they aren't doing anything to fix. I hope this helps someone else!",

Since I was very satisfied with that Mr. Coffee I looked for the current Mr. Coffee item that was closest to the one I had. This item had the same features and I felt confident it would be a worthy replacement. On the positive side it works well in brewing the coffee. The coffee is hot from the first minute it is brewed up until it shuts off. You can use the timer to have it brew your coffee at the desired hour. It will shut itself off after two hours. The negative aspect so far has been it persistently drips when you remove the carafe to pour our coffee. I have learned to pull it back a little to get it to drip for @ 15-20 seconds and that helps most of the time. When I try to take it out before it has finished brewing it will drip unlike my previous model. The carafe itself looks and feels less sturdy and less well-made as my previous model. It flexes when I clean it and I am pretty nervous about how fragile it feels when it is full of scalding hot coffee. also you cannot adjust the heat level. It gets annoying that I have to constantly clean the hot plate due to the dripping but it is functional enough to where I will put up with it until it fails and needs to be replaced. So like so many things in life, it isn't great but it isn't terrible... it is just tolerable.",

Thankfully, Amazon customer service is very good and they shipped me a replacement the next day. While I cant speak to the efficiency and dependability of the new one (as it has yet to come in), I am really hoping it is much better than this other one. I bought it for my office so it gets used daily, and it was truly a horrifying moment when we realized coffee wouldnt be made that day. It really looks very nice and has the aesthetics of a coffee maker twice as expensive, but I understand this might be a common problem with this model. I have a Cuisinart at home which works beautifully, so if this coffee maker does it again, Ill probably just invest in another Cuisinart for my office instead.",

The biggest disappointment is it lasted less than one year before dying. The electronics light up, but nothing happens. No brewing, no heat. It is very disappointing when one wakes up to a cold, unbrewed/empty coffee pot. I previously owned Cuisinarts, each which lasted 5 years before dying.

I'm sick to death of appliances that won't last and our throwaway culture. I don't want to buy 16 different coffee makers over the next 10 years. I want one. ======================= It's a pretty good unit for the price point. I am dismayed at how ridiculously expensive decent coffee makers have gotten, and this was the best one I could find for a reasonable price that didn't have abysmal reviews. Cons: - The carafe sits too close to the top of the drip area, resulting in major condensation above the carafe so when you remove said carafe, it results in drips all over the hotplate. - The \"strong\" brew choice seems to not work at all. If I set it onto strong, the unit runs for about 30 seconds then apparently thinks it's finished and switches off. It's not a total deal breaker for me though because the coffee on the regular setting turns out just fine. - Didn't include a metal filter, which I had to purchase separately for $10. Pros: - Thoughtfully designed. The spray head swings out of the way to access the brew basket, and the lid has a piece that will automatically push the spray head back into place when you close it so you don't have to worry about forgetting to re-position the spray head. - Good quality carafe - Hotplate / burner is teflon coated allowing very easy cleanup - Auto brew timer so you can have coffee ready when you wake up - Very reasonable price - Classic drip brew style! I can't stand the \"brew stations\" and all that nonsense that has been so popular lately and seem to be pushing classic drip brewers out of the market.",

The water is clear and the longer the unit sits with water in the reservoir the more water is on the counter top so I surmise it is an internal reservoir leak.

They just get so nasty and clogged (we have very hard water where I live) that buying a new one makes sense. This one didn't clog or get nasty. It just stopped working. The clock still worked, but that was it. I pressed all the buttons and nothing happened. I checked the fuses and switched it to various other plugs around the house. Nothing. It was done.

This causes the element to overheat over time... about 90-120 days, and the whole unit stops working when that happens. As the warming system has a max of two hours time at a fixed temp you're stuck reheating in a microwave if you don't use up your brew the first pass. We strongly suggest a rewrite of their manual to advise AGAINST restarting the warming tray, or a redesign to avoid whatever element failure is happening that breaks the whole thing.

The major issue is that there is an auto sensor on this model that was broke from day 1 that switches to \"Thermal\" or \"Glass\", It is stuck in the Thermal Mode. In the Thermal mode, it switches the hot plate off and unless you have a Metal Thermal Carafe you can't get hot coffee after the first cup. We do NOT own a metal Carafe, so it was quite frustrating...Luckily, I found a YouTube video (that said this model is notorious for this device failing) for advice and I opened up the bottom of the machine and removed the Thermal sensor (wasn't too tough), and now the problem is solved, but I'm sure I voided my warranty. Minor issues - I don't care for the flat bottom filter either, seems like we use more coffee, and I don't really care for the organization of the components in the tray area. They don't easily fit into each other and you have to move the water tube spout over each time you access the coffee tray and the water filter that sits on top gets dirty each time you brew coffee.

At first, I figured that the smell was simply part of the manufacturing process and would come off after a few days. I tried everything. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I ran 2 vinegar brews, scrubbed the inside of the reservoir with vinegar (and on another occasion with vodka like one reviewer suggested), ran 5 hot water brews, left the lid open over night, ran another 3 hot water brews the following day and then 3 more the day after that. I didn't notice the offensive plastic smell anymore so ON THE THIRD DAY I decided it was finally ok to brew my first pot of coffee. Much to my dismay, the plastic smell reared its ugly head again and worse, I could taste it in the coffee. Literally could not stomach it and had to toss the entire pot out. Sorry, but appliances should be working properly from the moment you take them out of the box. I went above and beyond to give this product a chance, but now strongly believe it's defective and needs to be redesigned with a different manufacturing process.",

It still works. The second one I just replaced had a thermal carafe (a 95 model) with a crappy top that eventually stopped working and could not be replaced so I had to get a new unit. The old one made good coffee but the carafe didn't keep the coffee hot. I read a bunch of reviews before buying this one because I like my coffee. The more expensive ones did not seem to justify the extra money. This one works well enough, but it does have that weird plastic smell. I thought it would go away after awhle but ten or so brews along it's still there.The coffee seems to have an off taste - maybe it's my imagination. I will try the vinegar treatment but this is something the manufacturer should not let out of the factory. When you take off the carafe to pour the first cup, a few drops of coffee always get on the heater plate and sizzle away. The glass carafe seems flimsy. I expect it to break some time soon. The heater burns the coffee in less time than it takes for me to drink it all so I pour it in a real thermos carafe which works much better than the Mr. Coffee one. I don't use the program function so I think I am going back to the old Chemex or Mellita my wife always teased me about . PS- I didn't go back to the Melitta and Chemex is too expensive. After three years of service, the carafe was okay but the water reservoir started leaking so I replaced it with a non-programmable model. The old stained one I gave my daughter is still going strong.",

The clock is set into a deep recess so it is unreadable unless you are on the same level. Be prepared to get on your hands and knees to read or program. The glass carafe does not \"clicK\" well onto the warmer so unless you position it exactly it runs over. When the maker starts, it emits three LOUD beeps, which may wake you up if, like me, you have it set to come on ten minutes before your usual arising time. The optional thermal carafe does work very well though. Mr. Coffee needs to give the 70s their technology back and make just a few inexpensive changes to make this worth buying. Since this was only about $30, when this breaks, I will toss it without a second thought",

That one made it 6 months before just \"up and quitting\" like the first. So...now I am using the first warranty replacement and am going to get replacement on the second one. Really disappointed in this unit, thought Mr. Coffee would be a better brand. So, I don't recommend buying this model, although when it worked it worked fine.

I'll cover what you need to know in two categories; PROS: Programmable -- Can set up your pot of coffee for when you wake up next morning. Burner -- Features a burner beneath that keeps the coffee warm (without cooking it) for up to two hours before automatically shutting off. Fast Brew Time -- Your pot of coffee will be hot and ready within 5 - 10 minutes depending on how much coffee is being brewed. CONS: Dual - Brew Settings -- Only the \"Regular\" setting seems to work properly, while \"Strong\" attempts to brew a stronger batch of coffee by brewing it hotter. Instead the unit will just burn off most of the water leaving a small puddle of sooty coffee in your pot. Yuck Water Loss -- Despite using the \"Regular\" brew setting, this coffee pot seems to completely evaporate 1 - 2 cups of water with every batch you make. Effectively contradicting the \"12-cup\" in the product title.",

                "review_text": "Based in part on the review by Consumer Reports, I purchased this coffee maker in haste as ours, a Cuisinart is breaking down. For years I had always found Braun to be the best drip coffee makers. However, when Proctor & Gamble bought Braun they were quick to shut down the small appliance division hence bye-bye Braun. Cuisinart suffered a similar fate when Conair bought them out. Manufacturing from Paris was farmed out to China and both the build quality and performance of most all Cuisinart small appliance have suffered. First the immediate problems associate the Mr. Coffee. I find the build quality less than sub par, virtually free of metal and all plastic construction makes for a flimsy product. The construction is cheap and it feels and looks so. No ABS plastic as you would find in higher end machines such as those made by Bunn, Krups, Kitchdaide and others - instead this is the stuff that's sharp and brittle like bottom basement, Dollar Store toys. In addition the carafe is made of such micro thin glass that I fear any un-intentional tap against a counter corner or other mishap will result in a crack or shatter. The filtering system is useless - and here's why. Having kept fish as a hobby for over 40 years I use a great deal of Activated Carbon to remove chlorine, trace metals and medications. But I use it sparingly and only for short periods of time. I mention this because if you do choose to use the filters be aware that many people suffer acid indigestion, Gastric Reflux and myriad of other problems to even small traces of Carbon. Activated Carbon also turns bad in time and instead of removing unwanted chemicals and gases from your water it does the opposite - it releases it's own set of pollutants which raise the PH of your water, making it quite a bit more acidic. The message here is, if you're going to use the carbon filters I urge you to swap them out every three - four weeks. * The filtering system - The Mr. Coffee filtration system is poorly thought out. It's awkward and difficult to replace and remove. This is hassle you get yourself into when you commit to on going purchases of replacement filters. * Low heat - Regardless if you drink pure Kona and grind the beans yourself or are just as happy with pre-ground Maxwell House most coffee lovers would agree they want their cup of Joe piping hot. In this regard I agree with many of the reviewers here in that even on the highest setting the coffee just isn't hot enough. Nothing worse than having to micro-wave your coffee immediately after brewing. Of course, this albeit a common trait may not be important to you as we all have different tastes. I will give this model accolades as far as it's aesthetic in relationship to it's rock bottom price. Few models in this price category have any integrity of design what so ever. At least the unit itself although plasticy and toy like - has a clean and gleaming face. However, another design I'm not happy with is the attached lid - making for yet another hassle when running through the dishwasher. Perhaps in a college dorm room or as a back this unit might be the ticket as the price is so low. For us it has proved to be of poor design, cheaply made and a poor performer.",

This eventually went away for the most part, but ever now and then the smell returns. In addition, the coffee has a hint of the taste of plastic even though I am using the water filters. Not good, but I am hoping that it will eventually go away. The other negative, which I admit is minor, is that the opening on the carafe is kind of small, which makes it difficult to get my hand inside the carafe to wash it. Not a big deal.",

So, I bought a huge jug of vinegar and ran 5 pots of a 50/50 water/vinegar solution through the machine followed by 5 pots of plain water. The taste was better (drinkable), but still tasted like plastic. So I ran 5 more pots of 50% vinegar followed by 5 pots of water. This time the difference was less noticeable--still tasted like plastic. Not good. I thought maybe time would take care of the last of the plastic taste or maybe I'd just get used to it. I used the coffee maker for a month--2 pots a day, every day. This morning I poured my first cup of coffee for the day and...blech! I give up. I've had my last cup of plastic coffee. I'm buying an all metal percolator. I gave the coffeemaker 2 stars instead of 1, because it looks nice, works well, and is easy to clean. If only it made better coffee.",

Mostly gave us 1/2 a carafe or lesser seldom more, then after a month lesser and lesser until 2-3 ounces only and then not even hot and finally nothing! No coffee no heat no brewing! When I called Mr Coffee they said they will send a replacement. That was 4 months ago and even turned a new year! No replacement and no shipment email or explanation of any kind. Recently I stopped at a garage sale and they had the deluxe model thermal carafe with the double pipes 12 cup programmable. Seller said it didn't work for them either. Worse the insulation lining peeled off and now it may be dangerous to use. Do not waste your time and money buying this brand. It is not the same company and for me little integrity.",

I have had this for just shy of 5 months, so this review is based off of actual use and not just first impressions. My initial thoughts were positive and I had so issues to start, but while disappointing for such a highly rated model, they were not deal breakers. Initial Issues - Clock is not back light and is almost impossible to read. - Hard to clean if coffee grounds go anywhere they are not supposed to. - The removable part that holds the filter, needs to be placed back just right. If not all the coffee builds up inside and causes quite the mess. After a bit over 4 months, I ran into issues with the burner. It was getting so hot that the coffee in the carafe was starting to \"pop\" as I think it was close to a boiling point. After that I did not want to use the auto timer or have it on when people were not around. Shortly after that issue it stopped brewing at all. Lights and all that go on and it appears like it should work, but nothing happens. After doing a bit more research on this, it seems to be a VERY COMMON problem with this model, which is why it is currently rated only a 1.7 at Mr Coffee.",

However, since then, the condensation has built up so much that the clock cannot be read at all. Luckily, I always do my delayed brew at 6:00 a.m., so I don't have to change it. But if I ever do have to change it, there will be no way to set it for the right time again. And if I ever have to unplug it for any reason, I'll be out of luck. The Start/Off button does NOT turn the unit off. Luckily, since I am using the glass decanter, it shuts off automatically in two hours. And luckily, I have not had the need to brew another pot before it shuts off, since you are supposed to turn it off to do that. If I ever really have to turn it off before it shuts off, I would have to unplug it, which would suck, since I would never be able to reset the clock because of the above problem. I also do not like how you have to fill it. Trying to pour water from the glass decanter into that small fill area is not easy, and the water always spills out around the machine, and some goes through the filter area and down into the burner. I always have to wipe up a lot of spilled water every time I fill it. I liked my old coffee maker that had a removable reservoir you could fill at the sink...no pouring. And finally, there is always a lot of sediment at the bottom of every pot. I use the proper measurements, and am using the gold tone permanent filter which I ordered with it. I don't even use the strong setting very often. I don't know why I'm getting that sediment, but I can never drink the whole pot to the bottom because of it. I thought the pot would be okay after using it for a week or so, and I discarded the box and all the packing materials, so now I can't return it. Very unhappy with this pot, but will have to live with it as I'm not going to rush out and spend more money on a new one.",

Even with the glass pot if you try to use the strong brew setting the coffeemaker beeps, the strong brew indicator shuts off but at least it makes a fair pot of coffee. No one at Mr. Coffee ( Jarden)knows what to do. So do not expect to brew with the thermal pot if you like strong coffee. Amazon was good and at first sent me a replacement but that did the same thing so I called Jarden and then they started sending me coffeemakers.

The other morning it was accidentally left plugged in, and in the middle of the day it turned itself on with lights were flashing wildly, then off, then flashing again. It has now been removed from the counter top and our old machine brought back out until a replacement is purchased. The electrical problems are well documented.

The display, buttons, and lights all continued to appear to work, but the machine would no longer heat the water and feed it through the grinds. I assume that there was some disconnect in the wiring between the display and the heating mechanism, but I'm not sure. I should also say that twice I had the problem of the plastic basket filling with water and overflowing. Contrary to D. Diggler's review, it is *not* difficult to make this mistake, for it lies not in using extra filters, grounds clogging the plastic basket, or placing the carafe incorrectly. Rather, the problem is that you have to carefully replace the plastic basket: it's fairly easy to place it so that it doesn't rest as far down as possible in its holder, so that the spring mechanism that opens the valve when resting on the top of the carafe doesn't actually reach the carafe and so stays closed. The plastic basket does have a correct orientation (the back has little plastic guides), but they leave enough wiggle room that you can still place it such that it'll overflow. When the machine stopped working, I initially considered buying the same one again (and I considered giving it three stars), but the fact that I've had one just stop working on me without warning changed my mind. I'm not buying another.",

But one thing that is does, that some of the other Mr. Coffees are not so good at, is it pours smoothly, without dripping all over. Now for it's failures: The hot water drips too forcefully causing the coffee grounds to go to one side, resulting in very weak coffee, and dry coffee grounds. I had dealt with this by packing the coffee grounds down. But it still happens. When brewing coffee you have to press two buttons to make it strong. It's default is always \"regular\" (weak, tea like). The place where you pour the water in, is really close to the coffee filter, leading to cold water pouring into the fresh coffee grounds; this results in coffee grounds going into the coffee.

If you're the type who only has coffee once a day, first thing in the morning, and want it ready when you wake up, then this coffee maker would be perfect for you. You can set the auto start time, and it always functioned as it should, and who cares how long coffee takes to make when you're not awake yet.

It will beep ( stating that it's over) 30-45 minutes after its finished..makes no sense lol. After making a pot of coffee and if I run out and make another one, when I pour in steam pops down ( really scary with the noise and heat ). This morning, brewed coffee just like any other day, for some reason half of it spilled on the counter and there's a burnt smell.. I've never experienced coffee machine like this. I make my husband coffee daily... today we just gave up and he told me to buy a new coffee pot.... I'd give it 0 stars but no option.. Worst machine ever",

Make sure the carafe is properly set when making coffee with this one, and it's probably a good idea to keep an eye on it for a few minutes to make sure that it brews in the pot, and not all over your counter.

Second time I didn't have the pot pushed back enough. It looked right but wasn't. Third and fourth times were when the inside basket looks like it's in snug but once the water pours in it floats making it like a little boat of coffee grinds getting everywhere except in the coffee pot. You have to be careful it's in the exactly way and then double check before using if. The cord is short on the counter which is good and bad. Pulling it towards you to open the top to fill the water and put coffee in has to be able to clear the counter and I usually have to unplug it. Kind of annoying. Price was right.",

When you take the carafe out it drips faster than when the carafe was in and makes a mess. We used the included filter to see if that would slow it down, but unless we are only making a 4 or 6 cup pot it's a mess. We've tried different filters and different coffee's, no success. After a very good experience with Amazon Returns (the first one that arrived had a cracked carafe), we were very excited to try out our first \"decent\" coffee maker after using the cheapest ones we could find for a few years. Extremely happy with the features and the only thing amiss that we can find is that the measuring lines on the carafe do not equal the measuring lines on the side of the coffee maker. If we fill the carafe to 8 cups, it is closer to the 10 cup line when we pour it in. But that is minor all things considered.",

However, when the lid is raised there is still a strong plastic smell. The pause function is on all of the time. I have taken the basket apart trying to adjust the spring inside but it still does not work. The water fills up the basket and I have to raise the coffee pot up - hold and keep pressure on it- so the coffee will actually drip into the coffee pot. It does no good to set the timer because the coffee is held until I lift the pot up. Because of this, there becomes an issue with coffee grounds as well.

I saw that a consumer mag gave this unit a high rating based on this and that. Fine. All that is great. But it's 2014 and why is coffee dripping onto the warming plate when I take the carafe out during the brew cycle? It didn't used to be like that. Go back far enough and the spring/gasket in the brew basket on earlier models (80's 90's) were far stronger. It's not just Mr. Coffee, it's all of them in my experience.

So I called, and explained the situation, giving \"him\" my model number and reading codes off of the plug prongs. I was told that the item was a few months out of warranty, but didn't want to leave a bad review of a resolution was possible, as it was clearly an ongoing issue with this model. Alas, \"he\" could only offer me free shipping on a similar model. PASS. It looks like the newer similar models have newer similar issues! At least \"he's\" consistent?

Amazon has already agreed to replace the item, but that's less of a concern to me than the safety of the decanter. The way the decanter is constructed is by pressure alone. There are no pieces that screw it together, so if something is off, even a little bit, the whole thing can pop off of the decanter and fall out of your hands. Test carefully with cold water.",

After cleaning the coffee maker, I used the machine once and immediately noticed the burning plastic smell about which others have complained. That smell did diminish as I used it, but never completely went away. Worse, I do think it makes the coffee taste like plastic as well.",

On the sixth pot, that I brewed through the water filter, I noticed the coffee in the pot was not as dark as usual. Over half of the grounds, in the permanent filter, where DRY!!! I had to re-pore the hot colored water, to re-saturate the grounds in the filter, from my 32 oz. cup!!! Needless to say, spend another minute or so on clean up. SO, I may have to design and fab a \"distribution plate\" and place it on top of the filter OR perhaps, silicone caulk the bottom and 1/4\" up around the side of the permanent filter, to ensure full grounds saturation, FROM THE BOTTOM UP!!! WTF, MR. COFFEE... Do you just build stuff and not use them??? Why even bother with a clock you can't see??? Why have a brew strength button to push, when the water can only filter through, as fast as the water filter will allow anyway??? My last coffee brewer was made by Kenmore and though it wasn't perfect, it only cost me $25 and lasted me 7 years. I gave you the benefit of the doubt but don't think I will ever buy another one of your products!!! NUFF SAID >:(",

If I shine a flashlight directly on the LCD, I can make out the numbers enough to use, but that is ridiculous to have to do that when it may have cost all of 5-10 cents to backlight the screen. Also, their idea of placing a charcoal disk over the top of the filter basket to filter the water is absurd! I (used to) like Mr. Coffee, so the shoddy construction really caught me off-guard. Laying a round disk of charcoal on top of the filter basket is just so incredibly stupid, I am at a loss for words - did NO-ONE in this country see this crap before approving the design? I doubt it. And if this coffeemaker was built in the USA, then the engineering staff should be fired immediately! Never again will I waste my money on anything Mr. Coffee, I'll spend the extra bucks for a European design that can be used as intended. I expect this junk from China, not from us (the USA)!",

On the plus side, it is easy to use and looks good in my kitchen which has other black appliances.

We rely heavily on the delay brew function and love having the coffee freshly brewed hot and ready when we wake up. About a month ago we noticed the coffee began brewing earlier and earlier even though we had not changed the brew time. Upon further investigation we found that the problem was actually that the clock was gaining time. So every evening before bed we would adjust the time to correct it, this worked okay for a few days with the clock still gaining time but only a few minutes. Now the clock gains time randomly anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes overnight. Since the time is randomly gaining there is no way to predict a good brew time. So,if the delay brew function is used...it results in morning coffee that can be almost an hour old...not the same as fresh brewed! Now to ensure a fresh cup of coffee in the mornings we must manually start the machine. We spent the extra money for a programmable model....not a manual brew model. VERY Disappointed in this purchase!!",

Two main complaints: 1. It seems to require quite a lot of grounds relative to the amount of water in the reservoir to make coffee that isn't completely see-through, even on the \"strong\" setting. Changing the fineness of the grind, brand of coffee seems to have no effect. I'm Mr. Coffee paper filters, and didn't want to invest in the cage filter because... 2. There's a strong burnt plastic taste/smell in every pot even after 2 weeks of brewing, regular cleaning of the pot. Using filtered vs. tap water makes no difference. I wish I'd read more reviews (quite a few of which point out this issue) before I purchased this model. My frustration with this machine was bad enough that I decided to give up on drip altogether, bought a Bialetti Moka for the same price.. Apples to oranges, I know.. but it makes infinitely better coffee with only slightly more effort and grounds expended per brew. I'm only brewing for myself (gf drinks decaf) so the smaller capacity and lack of timer doesn't really bother me. The Moka also saves on counter space, still works when the power is out if you have a gas range :)",

It was a spring-loaded nightmare waiting to happen and an utter disappointment, not to mention the 16 minute brew time. Finally, we bit the bullet and went for the no-frills Mr. Coffee. Having had it for about 2 weeks now, it is a fine brewer. Pros: easy to set up, doesn't drip, acceptable brew time, user friendly. Cons: cheapo construction, basket-style filter (I prefer cone), no backlight on the clock (WTF?), tons of condensation on the lid after use, doesn't brew quite hot enough. Overall, not great by any means, but it brews a decent cup of coffee and that's that.",

The settings are easy to use and I can easily set it to make coffee before I wake up. The major downfall of the coffee maker is that the filter overflows when brewing. This results in coffee grounds in the pot. This problem can be fixed by using fewer coffee grounds, but then you have to brew less coffee each time. I have tried multiple solutions to the problem with no satisfactory result. I have tried to weigh down the filter, thinking that the drip stopper was not fully compressed while brewing. However, it still drains to slowly and overflows. I have tried cleaning the product with vinegar with no change. I have used fewer coffee grounds, but this results in having to make smaller amounts of coffee. The problem I am having is not serious enough that I want to go through the trouble of returning it, but it is definitely a drawback. When it comes time to replace this one, I will be looking for another model or perhaps another brand. I understand that this might be a problem with the specific item I bought and may not be present on every coffee maker of this same model. However, I'm not testing multiple coffee makers.

I can't believe that some reviewers find this product satisfactory. The design of this product is abysmal. I don't know if it is lack of knowledge on the part of the industrial designer, margin squeezing on the part of the bean counters or just failure to follow design specs on the part of the Chinese manufacturer and quality (what a joke) control. For starters, the drain hole in the basket is too small to handle the flow of coffee into the pot. Secondly the shut-off valve doesn't allow coffee to drain into the pot. The result is that coffee overflows the basket and grounds end up in the coffee. If you don't mind coffee grounds in your coffee, I guess it's okay. I managed to create groundless coffee by watching the basket and shutting off the coffee maker when the basket filled with fluid, turning it back on when the basket emptied. See my comments on the gold filter that Mr. Coffee is selling to go with this pot. It was designed by someone who never saw a coffee maker or else the bean counters decided plastic was cheaper than screen mesh and substituted plastic instead of mesh for the bottom of the basket. It isn't especially fast. It take the c.m. 15 minutes to transfer 12 cups of water into the pot.That's just adequate in my book. I really can't understand what happened. Years ago we had a Mr. Coffee maker and it was a great machine. Had a timer and made great coffee. I was influenced by that experience and by the most purchased rating to buy this one, although I did notice mixed reviews.Save your money. Don't buy this junk.

I always gave credit to the coffee we used and the blend I would custom create rather than give credit to the coffeemaker. Unfortunately the unit quit working. I read many reviews before making another choice. Since we had such good luck with the older unit, I decided to disregard the negative reviews regarding new Mr. Coffee units. They stated that the plastic in the current units gave a strange taste to the coffee and that the coffee was was not very good. I should have given high regard to these negative reviews, as we are finding that they were accurate. Along with the taste, comments about pouring from the caraffe are definitely accurate. Although the coffee is drinkable, it is not up to the standard set by the older unit. I am using the identical conditions that I used with the older unit, and I received the replacement unit within two days of the old unit, so it is not as if my memory had tempered my judgement. And other people have also commented on my findings. Hence, I have received authorization to return the unit to Amazon. Their return policy is great, especially under a situation like this.

After about two months, the internal clock fried itself, so both the automatic brew function and the automatic two-hour shut off stopped working. Now it starts, but just cuts the power halfway through brewing. Definitely skip this one.",

My biggest complaint with this one, and in fact most Mr. Coffee makers, is the design of the 'sneak a cup' feature where you can remove the pot while it is still brewing. When the pot is placed in the maker the lid presses on a spring in the coffee basket which allows the brewed coffee to flow into the pot. However, if the pot isn't pushed all the way to the back of the maker then the spring won't be engaged so coffee will overflow the basket and start pouring over the sides. When that happens about 20% of the coffee will make it into the pot but the rest will end up on the counter, in the drawers, and on the floor. That's a terrible way to start your day.",

I purchased the coffemaker in March 2014, enjoyed it for ten months, bought a thermal carafe for the coffeemaker in December, and in January 2015 the coffeemaker stopped working. The pump has stopped efficiently delivering water to the grounds, the coffee brews much more slowly while mixing in too much air into the water being delivered to the grounds in the basket, and when the coffee maker 'thinks' that it is finished, there are at least a few cups of water remaining in the reservoir. It is broken! I wish we could replace the pump without trashing the whole coffeemaker, but it isn't obvious how that could be done. We did try running several cycles of diluted vinegar through the coffeemaker, and cleaned the part of the pump we could access with a pipe cleaner, but neither seemed to have any effect. Too bad!

Major problem is that the water is not heated sufficiently when the coffee is brewed to deliver a hot cup of coffee when the brewing process stops. As cold tap water temperatures are somewhat cooler out of the tap in the winter I tried slightly preheating the water before placing it in the coffeemaker...no major improvement. Temperature of coffee in pot immediately after being brewed about 145 degrees. What's interesting is that the coffee did indeed get hotter after sitting on the heating element than it was after it initially brewed. Unfortunately, we like to drink coffee immediately after it has been brewed not 30 minutes or an hour later. Our old Braun coffee pot delivered much hotter coffee. A few minor points include the area where you pour water into the coffeemaker being a little smaller than expected,and the need to move the brew water delivery arm back and forth. This coffee maker was bought as one of a few small things that we put under our Christmas tree to give ourselves so the 30 day return period to Amazon has past otherwise it would go back.",

I will keep using it for now, but this is actually the last Mr. Coffee I will ever buy as my last two, which were even more expensive units, died within 18 months. Those did not have the smell issue at least. Pros: Makes coffee, has a timer to auto brew in the AM Cons: smells like a plastics factory, no temp control for the burner underneath, and the cheap \"chrome\" bubbled and scuffed on the first use.",

We have made a a real effort to keep it dry after use - as our last Mr. Coffee had the same problem. This looked like a better quality model and we hoped it would last longer but it is not the case. We have had other coffee makers in the past that lasted for 10+ years without any corrosion. This is a product design flaw I am sure trading off cost savings with long term reliability. This company needs to design integrity back into its products. I remembered my Mom having one that must had lasted 20+ years.

I also love being able to set a time to have the coffee start. I know this is standard on a lot of coffeemakers now, but it was the first time I had one that could operate that way. It also comes with a water filter which seems to help the quality of the coffee. I was disappointed to find that the overall coffee quality still had the plastic-like taste that many coffee makers with plastic filter baskets seem to possess. However, I'm not sure if it is possible to get rid of this taste without a metal filter basket. All said, this is the best coffee maker I have owned, but I still prefer the taste of coffee shop coffee.",

Don't know why it doesn't brew as strong as other brands. We have never used the strong brewing setting on others. So, if you like your coffee even somewhat strong, this may not be the coffee maker for you. Also, it's REALLY bright chrome, doesn't look great next to my stainless appliances.

For instance, the manual claims that once you set the brew strength to \"strong\" (my preference), it will remember and default to it in the future. It doesn't - not a big deal, but it means pressing an extra button every time I use it. More annoying is that when set to \"strong\", it starts to brew for a few seconds, then the sensor decides it's finished brewing for some reason, gives the beep-beep that it's ready, and turns off the \"brewing\" light. Luckily, it still continues brewing coffee after this, but the handy signals for when it's ready don't work right. It seems to work fine with the \"regular\" strength setting though. There are 1 or 2 other minor things like this too. I got as a replacement for a previous Mr. Coffee maker that broke, and it did not have these weird issues.

Next morning attempted to brew a pot of coffee...what a mess. Hardly any coffee in the carafe, but tons all over the counter. During the process of coffee running out of the machine all over the counter it shorted something electrical and now the unit is dead in the water. Threw it away and bought a Kitchen Aid. The KA works great. I think some of the cons of the Mr. Coffee are: The so called water filter is actually a stand alone unit that you place on top of grounds. Seriously, what? Perhaps that led to the water now draining incorrectly. The unit itself is made of cheap material. The \"metal\" accents are actually cheap plastic painted with shiny silver paint. Okay I get that it is a inexpensive unit, but coffee is all Mr. Coffee does. Can't they improve this? Will NEVER buy another of their products.",

It isn't mentioned at all in the manual, except to list it as a part, but you need to remember to move it out of the way to remove the basket, and then remember to position it back over basket to brew. - Clock isn't backlit which makes setting the timer a real P-I-T-A.

I promptly contacted Amazon and, as usual, they processed a replacement quickly and efficiently. I received the second unit and it tripped my circuit breaker the first two times I tried to use it. I was just about to return it, but I tried it one more time and it started working. Rather than return a second unit in one week, I decided to give it a shot. Big mistake. It worked for the next two months but has now stopped working. It sounds like it is about to brew but then starts pumping out steam and then straight smoke. The pump does not appear to be working as water never flows correctly and it seems to be over heating. I am glad it did this while I was watching because the smoke sure seemed like it was about to catch ON FIRE. I unplugged it immediately and it stopped. This model clearly has serious quality control issues. I can't believe it was so well rated on consumer reports. This is a dangerous product. Amazon's return policy doesn't allow me to return outside of 30 days. So, I guess I can deal with the manufacturer and try to get them to do something with this $29 piece of crap. Do yourself a favor and stay away.",

My wife and I just want to have about 3 or 4 cups a day total between us, but the the water level sensor for glass is for 10 or 12 cups. So we have been trying to make more than we need because the coffee maker shuts off before we finish our first cup- A feature for thermal. So now even with the extra needed to register glass it still only registers thermal and shuts off.Grrr. I called Mr. Coffee and spoke to a very matter-of-fact rep who told me essentially that's just the way it is. Thanks a lot! I threw the box away so I now I have to buy another coffee maker. Bet it's not Mr. COFFEE ; )",

However, there seems to be a bug: When I try to use the \"strong\" setting with the optional thermal carafe, the machine starts brewing, and then shuts off completely after 10-15 seconds. I can turn it back on, set it back to strong, and let it start brewing again, but 10-15 seconds later it once again shuts off. The only way I've found to get a pot of \"strong\" coffee with the thermal carafe is to repeatedly do this all the way through the brew. (I didn't count how many times I had to restart it, but it's probably a couple dozen or more.) Just as a test, I tried with no coffee or filter or filter basket in place -- just plain water -- and the same thing happened. When I reported this to Mr. Coffee support & service, they very helpfully sent me a replacement and a postage-paid return label. Unfortunately, the replacement unit does exactly the same thing. It looks like a design flaw, not an isolated manufacturing defect. When I called again, tech support said they could replace my machine with a different model, but said they have no other models that can take both a glass and thermal carafe. *sigh*",

What the heck, Mr. Coffee. If I was a nocturnal bat, do you think I would need this coffee maker? When I received the coffee maker, it was upside down in the box but I figured that is no big deal. I read the whole manual, cleaned it out as instructed, put the pieces together, THEN I noticed that the logo was upside down. Despite it looking a little ridiculous, I figured an upside down logo never hurt anyone so I'd keep it. Before this machine, we used a single-serve coffee maker and a French Press. It has been a while since using a machine with a carafe, but so far it seems to do its job. We purchased the reusable coffee filter and some more water filters. I did not realize that when I bought the machine originally, but you will need to replace the water filter every month. It's not costly... it is about $5 for 6 filters on amazon. The beep on the machine caught me off guard at first... it beeps about four times and sounds kind of like a smoke detector. It will beep when it's done, and then beep again when it turns off automatically. Overall, for 35 bucks, I'd say it's worth it.",

Then the regular drip slowed to a crawl, brewing 6 cups of coffee took 22 minutes, REALLY!!!! The \"shower head\" that the hot water comes out of is limited at best and does not thoroughly saturate the grounds so you have to use more coffee. The water tank is difficult to fill as it is hard to see the lines, I oftened uses a flashlight just to see the markings.

                "review_text": "I'm coming up (or just passed) about the three year mark using one of my EC155 machines (one is used much more than the other) and I can say that I've just about reached the end of the machine's lifetime. For the first two years of use, I pulled 18g shots two to three times a day and this past year has been an average of one pull a day in the morning (16g of coffee). If I compare the performance of the machine I use much more often and the machine that has about half a year's worth of use on it, I can definitely say that my three years of heavy use have just about knocked my EC155 out of its full capacity. The power of the pumps in the two machines have a night and day difference - I have to be very careful with how much coffee I load in the portafilter in the machine I use more to make sure it can still push out anything. As a side note, I can still achieve proper crema and pour lattes in both. Seeing as it's time to replace the dying EC155 I've reached a crossroads that speaks to the quality the EC155 provides at its price point. A lot of the \"higher-end\" (~$100-$500 range) espresso machines have issues that are apparent in the EC155 such as unstable temperature control and poor steam generation. For a sub-$100 machine, the EC155 does a great job as long as you know a few important tricks! Here are a few I've picked up through refining my coffee rituals: 1. Toss aside the pressurizer that comes with the portafilter (the small black circular object that screws into the plate and the black plate). This pressurizer works via a spring loaded system that attempts to introduce artificial pressure into the grounds so that the water coming through the portafiler needs to achieve a certain pressure before coming out. I've found that if you load enough grounds in and tamp properly it isn't necessary at all for achieving a crema. In the end you should just have three pieces: the outside of the portafilter, the gasket, and the metal holder 2. Either take off the bottom half of the portafilter handle or cut off the plastic underneath the portafilter to get yourself a sort of bottomless portafilter system. You'll be able to watch your shots come out of the machine and I've found that a lot of coffee liquid gets stuck in this piece without there being any big benefit. Also this frees up some much needed room for a taller cup. 3. Put a book or something under the machine to have more clearance for a frothing cup. 4. My routine for preparing a latte is to preheat the machine for anywhere between 30 minutes to hours (I used to have a outlet timer that would automatically turn my machine on in the morning). The top of the machine should be hot to the touch by the time you're ready to go for it. There will be a few cycles of heating in this time (i.e. green light on/off/on). I first weigh out my coffee (I grind mine fresh but I have used pre-ground before and there is a bit of a difference) and fill the portafilter and tamp it down (I usually use 18 grams in the larger portafilter). You lock the portafilter in as much as you can - it won't be completely straight but you should feel the gasket get tighter as you turn it. In accordance with espresso theory of not leaving a shot for more than a short time out, I heat/froth my milk first before actually pulling my shot. Frothing the milk to proper latte consistency to be able to pour art was probably the most difficult thing for me to achieve. Any machine has a little bit of water come out of the frother once you turn the knob so its best to have a cup to just purge out some excess water before you froth your milk. Since the EC155 has an auto-frother (i.e. has those holes in the top of the frother), you don't need to pull the milk and listen to the clicking noise as if you had a \"legitimate\" machine. Simply stretch the milk a bit (introduce air to create micro bubbles - should increase volume of milk) before finding a sweet spot where the milk is able to whirl around from the frother's airstream. This should incorporate those bubbles into your milk to get that silky consistency. I learned from SeattleCoffeeGear to leave the steamer valve on all the way and turn the knob to the coffee pull setting (all the way to the right) to purge out one shots' worth of coffee from the reservoir (until the green light turns off) just so that the machine is forced to heat a fresh amount of water to try to get that ideal temperature. 20-28 seconds of a pull and a bit of milk swirling and pouring later and you have a latte! 5. I descaled my machine a few times which helped the performance out a lot back in around year 2 but it looks like at this point the machine is going to have to be retired :/. The EC155 is really a great machine (especially for someone in college/grad school who needs to justify the price). Theres a lot of little tricks you can pick up that give the machine all the more character. I'm not sure if I'll stick to getting another EC155 next, but for anyone who's shell shocked by the prices forums and websites list for their machines, the EC155 is that affordable alternative. Like any culinary activity, if you focus on the ingredients (fresh roasted coffee) and prepare appropriately (burr grinder to achieve a consistent grind), you leave more leeway for the machine to work well. FYI I would rate myself as a budding coffee enthusiast, buying fresh roasted beans (light to medium roast) and I use a burr grinder.",

                "review_text": "I am Italian, born and raised. Moved to US at 30 yrs old. Moved to an area where there's no Italian-American influence, no chance of going out for an espresso. Only Starbucks... no thanks. Thought I could go by without espresso for 6 years (what was I thinking??? I don't know). Then sudden espresso cravings made me buy this espresso machine. De Longhi is a very common brand in Italy for any type of home appliances. I've had this machine for 6 months now, using it every day. It's awesome. Like the espresso cup you'd get in Italy \"al bar\". It gives a thick layer of \"crema\" on top of each cup. Here some answers to other reviewers' cons: * somebody wrote the water was not coming out and returned the machine: you need to bang the water tank real hard in position, otherwise it doesn't connect. It happened to me first time using it... I thought machine was defective too because coffee was not coming out. My husband banged it in there and started working right away. * ground basket is soupy: with espresso machines you have to fill the basket to its fullest, nothing like drip machines. You need to have coffee heaping out like an upside-down cone and then gently press it down with the tamper. Don't press too hard otherwise the water doesn't make it through. * built-it tamper sucks: this puzzles me. A tamper is whatever flat surface you have handy. In Italy people don't use tampers, considered a fancy thing for coffee shops. People just uses the back of a spoon to tamper the coffee down. The spoon that comes with this machine is perfect for that by the way. You just need a flat round surface of same diameter to have a great tamper. The built-in one works great. You only need a minor pressure otherwise you compact coffee too much. * takes long to heat up: maybe older version? Not sure about this. Mine is ready in one minute or less. * no cup warmer: in the manual says the top metal part is the cup warmer. It is warm if you let it warm up. I personally live in warm climate so don't need cup warmer, plus the coffee comes out very hot. True that there's no railing so cups can fall off easily (done that...). * frothing wand placement/length: I can't say much about it because I don't make cappuccino, I just drink straight espresso, black. One thing I'd say is that cappuccino in Italy is not what you know as cappuccino here, size wise. This may explain the wand dimensions. In Italy cappuccino is a single shot of espresso, with some frothed milk on top. When I say some, I mean really a little bit. The total output is less than one cup size for your cappuccino. That is very small. So when you need to heat up your milk, in theory you'd use a very small and short brick. If you'd see one of these you wouldn't believe it probably. * bitter coffee: this is very important. Espresso is supposed to be a very sweet cup of coffee. I never got used to the drip coffee or store bought cup of coffee just because it's too bitter. Not used to it. The difference is in the roast and grind. You cannot use coffee you'd use in the drip machine for the espresso machine. For your first espresso, just buy Illy ground espresso coffee. I recommend the black label. Just try it and that is your standard to compare other coffee to. That is the sweet taste you should get. I also recommend to buy pre-ground coffee, because the grind for espresso requires a serious (expensive) burr grinder, professional level to obtain a fine and homogeneous coffee suitable for these type of machines. To buy ground coffee, a cheaper option (cheaper than Illy) is Lavazza. I recommend \"Crema e Gusto\". This is the most commonly used brand in Italian families, that's all I drank in my family for instance. The \"Crema e Gusto\" variety gives a nice espresso. I think I covered all the points I wanted. I will add if realize I forgot something worth mentioning :-) Enjoy your coffee! April 2015 Update: we have been using this machine daily since our purchase in 2011 and it hasn't had a single issue so far.",

From my perspective, here\u2019s the good and the bad\u201d Good: (1) the espresso is good and has crema, (2) milk steams quickly, (3) water reservoir allows you to make multiple cups of espresso before refilling and (4) machine cleans easily. Not so good: (1) instructions are pitiful, (2) notch at top of dial where you choose coffee or steam is not easy to see\u2014on my first machine, I don\u2019t even think it was there (returned that machine), (3) only a small cup, no higher than 2 inches, will fit in machine and (4) it has to be warmed up before it makes a good cup of espresso\u2014I usually give it 15 minutes, but have made coffee after 5\u2014if you listen, you can hear it kind of gurgle when it\u2019s ready.",

                "review_text": "My Cuisinart EM-200 espresso maker is failing after just one year. Under warranty, but it would cost a lot shipping both ways, so I am trying a less expensive machine. I feel like I know my way around espresso and cappuccino so I think I'm qualified to critique this machine. First reaction was, it's pretty light weight, but that is not really a deal breaker. I like the simplicity of the control switch and really don't miss the automatic timer on pulling shots. I'm not sure why, but the crema is much much better than the Cuisinart ever made. Also, the milk frother works very very well expanding or \"stretching\" the milk into a thick foam like it's supposed to. The Cuisinart never was great in this regard. The drip pan doesn't have to be emptied every time it's used like the more expensive units that flush the hot water into the tray, wasting a lot of water. The steam control on top works very well and permits turning on and off for flushing before and after use. The Cuisinart automated electronics prevented flushing easily. So far my only complaints with this DeLonghi machine are the following: The steam wand is too short before it bends making it difficult to get to the bottom of even a small milk pitcher. The water reservoir is pretty small. The retainer on the portafilter does not hold the basket very well when emptying the used coffee puck. The portafilter does not have a latched position when installing. The tamper is kind of useless. Cup height max is about 2-1/2\", so even if I remove the drip tray, I can't use my insulated cups any more. I use either small espresso cups or wide low cappuccino cups. No problem. All things considered, this machine actually makes much better coffee than the Cuisinart so the minor complaints are tolerable. Update 10/7/17: Unit still works great. I'm very pleased with its simplicity and ease of use. The steam valve seems to be more robust than those on other espresso machines I have owned. The ECP3420 and EM-200 side style valves are prone to failure and leaking. One really should consider when buying an espresso maker, what do you do when it breaks? If it costs $80 or so, you can just throw it away, but if it's a $300 machine, who's going to fix it? And warranty repair is useless, they make you pay shipping both ways. Update: 12/1/17 Still working just fine. I always use distilled water so I have had absolutely no issues with having to de-calcify. I have changed my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars, because I am convinced that I could not do better for this price. If it does fail, I would buy the new -M version with a little more user friendly basket retainer.",

The only thing I will mention is that if you get your coffee already ground, don\u2019t use espresso grind! I bought some like that from Starbucks and when I tried it with the machine the water could t get through it and started spewing out the top. I tried it a few different ways to make sure I did accidentally pack it too tight but it did the same thing every time.

Also, I didn't have 2 1/2 inch tall cups, short enough to fit under the grounds holder that were also large enough for the amount of espresso needed, so I ordered the Konitz Coffee Bar Cappuccino cups (size 4), and I'm all set! It produces good espresso, is simple to use, steams well, warms up pretty fast, and is, so far, my favorite of the more inexpensive espresso machines (under $100.00).

You simply add water to the reservoir, turn the knob until red lights, add coffee to the (it must have a proper name) that has a handle and turn it counterclockwise. By that time the green light is on and you turn the knob further and presto. Yes, you have to empty the coffee to make another one but that is easy and cheaper than pods.

My normal morning coffee just wasn't doing it after indulging in weeks of rich espresso and cappuccino. This is the perfect little machine--totally legit. It doesn't take up a lot of space. It does exactly what it's supposed to do--produces a perfect espresso every time with lovely crema on top, and froths the milk to perfection. It is an Italian machine and therefore not made for tall, American coffee cups. I bought several cappuccino cups (Crate and Barrel has the best ones) and espresso cups that fit in the relatively small space. The scoop that comes with it works well for initial tamping, and then I press it under the machine's tamper to finish it off. Illy black espresso is the best, and I buy the two-packs on Amazon and always have it on hand. I love having a perfectly made cappuccino every morning now. I highly recommend this wonderful, inexpensive little machine.",

I've had machines that cost in the $200-$400 range and this machine performs as well or better than those! I would also like to address some of the complaints here. First, the noise. The only time this machine was excessively noisey for me was the first time I used it. After that, it's pretty quiet for an espresso machine. Next, the 15 minute warm up time. I know that's what the directions say to do, but it's absolutely not necssary. I have tried making a shot right after the green light goes on (a couple of minutes) and once it has warmed up for 15 minutes. I find no difference in the quality of the shot. Next up - the built in tamper. It works just fine. I've used my stainless steel tamper and I've used the built in tamper. When I tried my stainless steel tamper and tamped down hard, it did nothing but slow the machine way down and the shot tasted the same as when I use the built in tamper, just compacting the grounds. Finally the frother. Why does anyone bother with a built in frother? I heat my milk in the microwave and then froth it with a hand held milk frother I bought on Amazon. Just do a search for \"milk frother\" and you will find numerous brands to choose from. A bit of advice for those who don't get good crema on their shots. Buy fresh beans and grind them yourself with a burr grinder. If you do that, you will get good crema every time!",

It heats quickly, cleans easily, and produces quite good espresso with nice crema. It comes with one and two cup capacity strainers, with a seat under the lid for the one you are not using. For cappuccino, the frother works well, once you get the hang of it. Give yourself several tries to get your tamping right, and especially the use of the frother. The instructions say to use nonfat milk, but I've been using half and half successfully (fewer carbs). I had a dozen years old earlier version of the Delonghi espresso machine. The comparison is night and day. Not even close. After cleaning make sure the removable plastic water vessel is properly seated, then just top it up after each use or two. For the price I don't think you can do better. Enjoy. P.S. Be forewarned - there is only 2 1/2\" clearance between the strainer holder and the drip plate, which means you need a demitasse or other shallow cup.",

My previous machine was a Breville, which was not a pump version, and produced unsatisfactory results. The Delongi has been in use for over six months, and I have made a couple of modifications to address design shortcomings: 1. The issue with the frothing tube being unable to easily accommodate a 12\" pitcher was solved by raising the height of the machine by setting it up on stacked, glued-together ceramic tiles, which I then placed on a thin piece of flexible plastic used to put under rugs so they don't slip. Machine raised; problem solved. 2. The plastic frothing nozzle threads can easily be worn so steam escapes from the top. It was advised that the nozzle be removed after each use, but I didn't want to deal with the stripped threads at a later date. So after each use, I run a pitcher of clear water under the frother, turn it on, and let the water spit and froth up, cleaning the inside without having to remove said nozzle. 3. I hardly ever have to heat it up beyond 5 min. or so, and it works great. 4. Forget the cold milk thing. I'm crazy about half espresso/half milk. So I put the amount of water I want, right out of the tap, then add skim milk powder....mix it up and hit it with the steam. The forth is so dense it comes straight up over the side of the pitcher! You may not like it that stiff, but it's a suggestion for those who do. 5. Try an Italian roast coffee....darker and sweeter. Mmmmmm. When this baby dies, I will replace it with the same machine. A lot of bang for the buck here. It's a great product.",

I had to put the machine up on a 6\" platform to make it easier. I purchased a 10oz steamer cup but it was too tall until I raised the machine up... even then I found a 2 cup pyrex measuring cup worked best for the froth of the steam milk as it gave more volume to get the frothy milk. The machine is easy to clean. I typically just fill the pyrex measuring cup with water and run the steam to clean out after each usage. So I am not taking the plastic steamer piece off as it seems the threads will strip doing this alot. It produces nice espresso and frothy milk... so it is a keeper at this price! If DeLonghi would just increase the space where the cups go it would make it nicer!!",

                "review_text": "I have been using a Salton Three For All steam espresso machine for about 30 years (yes, the same machine). I could never bring myself to spend the money on a pump machine (they used to be really expensive). I decided I really needed to upgrade, so I did some research and found this machine is highly recommended all over the internet. Here is my experience with this machine: The instructions that come with the machine are almost completely useless. Really. I learned how to use it from YouTube and Amazon reviews and questions and answers. I let the machine warm up for 20 minutes, followed the instruction booklet to make espresso, and nothing happened. I watched YouTube videos, I searched the web for instructions, and found nothing. Finally I read the questions and answers here on Amazon - WOW, you folks are super helpful. I followed one person's recommendation of putting some water into the machine's reservoir, and pulling the reservoir out and re-inserting it a few times - then turn the dial on the machine to the steam function, turn the steam dial on top and run it till water comes out of the steam wand. This primed the machine and, yay, out came espresso! Now it works perfectly every time with no additional priming needed. Now I leave the reservoir in place and just refill it through the top of the machine. I saw a YouTube video where a guy had his machine set on top of a rectangular Pyrex baking dish and this is a good idea, I do the same. I might build a nice stand of some kind because the machine is not exactly the right size for the baking dish and I wouldn't mind something that looks nicer. I don't understand everyone's problem with the tamper on the machine. This thing is great! I scoop the coffee into the filter, then, holding the filter with my fingers, place a thumb on the tamper and pinch the filter and tamper together to tamp the coffee. You can go as firm or as light as you want. I can't see buying another gadget just to smoosh my coffee into the basket. The steamer wand is the ONLY thing on this machine I take issue with and I really don't like it. The wand has an internal spring holding it to the machine, so if I pull the wand out to steam the milk, it springs back and drips milk all over the machine before I can get a cloth to clean it. It also has a bend that doesn't allow the tip to get into a deep container, yet if the container is too shallow, the milk can overflow as it is steaming and expanding. It's not quite a deal breaker for me, but it is irritating. I steam my milk in a coffee cup or a pyrex measuring cup. I can't justify buying a pitcher just to steam milk. The clearance under the filter holder is very low - 2 & 1/2 inches or 6.35 cm. I use a large shot glass and it works great for me. A small cappuccino cup or a demitasse would definitely fit. The machine takes time to warm up. I turn it on in the morning, go do something else for a few minutes, then come back and make my coffee. I have to hold the cup while the machine makes the espresso - the machine vibrates and the cup moves back away from the coffee spouts - I have to hold it in place. I have a bag of Caffe D'Arte \"Taormina\" coffee and I ground up some with my blade grinder and made an espresso. The sky opened up and the angels sang! It was great. Then I went out and bought some illy and some Lavazza, already ground, in a can. I made some espresso with each and it was truly, honestly, awful. I just did a test this morning with all three coffees, tamping lightly and tamping heavily, and the Caffe D'Arte wins, with illy coming in second. The Lavazza just tasted super bitter. Maybe it's because it's already ground and has been sitting around a while - no telling how long the cans have been sitting on the shelf. The D'arte is roasted in Seattle, I live in Portland, and I ground it myself, so it's got to be fresher than coffee roasted and ground in Italy then shipped here. All in all, this machine is great for the price, especially as a Warehouse Deal. I've had it a week and I like it, but I would want some things to be different when this one retires and I need to shop for another one. I'll comment on longevity after using it a while.",

                "review_text": "I like it for my at home use, but it has its issues. The distance between the underside of the top of the machine and the bottom where you would sit a frothing pitcher is short. Its short short short. So much so that whenever I use the machine, I have to drag the machine to the edge of my counter, turn it sideways where it is parallel to my counter, so that I can steam the milk. The machine is just not tall enough to put and pull a frothing pitcher out. You have to be on the edge of a counter. Otherwise you won't be able to easily maneuver a pitcher to steam the milk. I bought a 12 oz pitcher which is the smallest pretty much, because anything bigger is just not going to work here. Look at the pictures in the ads. The only way to maneuver the pitcher in and out of the frothing wand is if you have it hanging off the edge of your counter It vibrates. When I put my shot cups under the machine and the shots begin to pull, it shakes and the cups shift a but. You have to hold them until the espresso shot starts to pull. The machine is just not substantial enough to stay put so yes your cups will shift until there there is something in it to keep it still. Thats about it for me for this machine. The shots it pulls are flavorful and I enjoy them. I dont understand what people mean by the tamp \"sucks\". Most people use the back of spoon or something--the attached tamp serves its purpose.You dont have to refill the reservoir often which is great--for at home use, this is a great and affordable machine. This is 2 months after having it so hopefully it will maintain.",

This is my first espresso machine and my coffee tastes like I bought it from the coffee shop. I've had it for about 3 weeks and use it daily. This machine is super easy to navigate and use. I was able to make the perfect latte on my first try without having any experience in using an espresso machine before. I mostly make lattes but I've been experimenting with making frappes. I love how easy it is to use and clean. The water reservoir holds more than enough water and is easily removable for refilling, or you can just add water to it, using a cup (easier and less time consuming). The manual says to let it heat up for 15 mins before using it but it's usually ready after about 2-3 minutes. I've heard people say the espresso turns out better if you let it warm up longer, but I think it's perfectly fine after only a few minutes. The machine is small but I have no issue with it. My milk frothing pitcher fits perfectly under the steamer, just make sure you don't buy a pitcher that is too large; there's really no need. I don't really use the top for warming my cups but I've touched it before and it does get pretty warm. I really don't know how I was surviving before I got an espresso machine. Tip: If you can't seem to get the espresso to come out when you first try it, make sure the steamer knob is turned completely off. The first day I got my De'Longhi I thought it was broken; I tried everything to get it to work. I eventually tried the steamer to see if it worked and it did. I turned the steamer off and tried the espresso again and voila! it worked!",

Well, that AND saving a LOT of money from driving to and buying the exact same drink at a retail where they expect a tip for handing you a drink. SAVE YOURSELF A LOT OF MONEY and make your own espresso drinks! Be sure to buy a good tamper (the thing on here is not adequate) as you MUST tamp down the espresso at 35 lbs of force to get it tight to extrude the best, strongest espresso. And if you plan to froth, get yourself a good milk pitcher. I use it 1-2 x every day and so far it is a great thing! If it changes, I'll update, but for now, I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

During the last 5 years I have had 3 Mr. Coffee espresso makers; 3 because the plastic parts on the carafe keep breaking, and one machine burned out after only 6 months. The coffee from them was just that: Coffee. No froth. I kept buying them from my local Bi-mart store here in Oregon, and they were cheap. I finally decided to spend more money and ordered this DeLonghi EC155 after researching reviews on the net. I have no way of knowing if a $300 or $400 home espresso maker makes better espresso, but I am very happy with my $100 plus shipping DeLonghi. The coffee looks and tastes like that from commercial coffee houses. There are a couple quirks regarding the design that I don't care for, but they are not deal breakers. The space allowed for the cup to fit under is simply too short. I had to go to Goodwill to find the right size of cup or carafe that would fit underneath. Yes, I could have ordered the ones advertised from the DeLonghi company, but I chose not to. Also, the vibration from the pump tends to move the small container around a little, which requires me to hold it in place before enough coffee dispenses to hold it in place. I have yet to use the milk frother. I prefer hearting milk in the microwave, mixing my additives into that when hot, and then pouring in the coffee which has very nice froth and cr\u00e8ma. This also saves me from cleaning the frother. I needed a compact design for my space requirements, and this is a perfect size for that. Don't let the maintenance instructions deter you. They sound intimidating until you see what they are talking about. I absolutely recommend this machine.",

                "review_text": "My husband just discovered a love for coffee and espresso after our twins were born last year. Like everything else he has to have the best of the best and after doing extensive research decided to purchase this. I love my old drip coffee maker and vowed to stay true to Mr. Coffee but after two weeks in our home I have found myself cheating on him with our De'Longhi - and for good reason! It makes a delicious shot with a beautiful crema, is super easy to use once you know what you're doing and clean up is a breeze. I love that I don't have to refill the water tank before each use, it takes just a minute or so to heat up and less than 30 seconds to fill the cup. With it being October I have been able to satisfy my craving without breaking the bank by making pumpkin spice double shot lattes at home every morning! My only complaint is the frothing wand is too low and it is hard to find a cup that will fit under it and still contain the milk I need for my latte. We put it on top of a box we had laying around and that works until we get our hands on a pitcher (assuming that will fit). Other than that it makes a perfect frothy steamed milk in no time. Also, when we first got it we thought it was broken and were ready to send it back. It was awfully loud and would not heat up. Thankfully it was bedtime for the twins so we just left it to do its' thing and when we came back we were happy to see it just needed a little more time to warm up. It has worked perfectly since then. After reading some other reviews I am hoping it lasts but will update if there are any issues down the road. Excellent product, great value, highly recommend!",

                "review_text": "This espresso maker works very well! It brews a strong espresso and the steam comes out hot so I can steam my milk quickly. This product comes with a single shot or double shot insert for the coffee grounds. I always use the double as I find the single is too small and does not make enough for my coffee needs. It is very easy to use and holds plenty of water in the reservoir for multiple cups of espresso. My only complaints are that the machine vibrates so much the cup I use to catch the espresso must be constantly held or it will rattle right off the base. Also, the steamer is so close to the bottom it is hard to get a steamer cup out without spilling once the volume in the cup has increased. A few flaws, but works fine if these are not issues for you. I would probably spend a little more money in the future to get something better, but this is great for the price range.",

                "review_text": "things to keep in mind, this is a light duty machine, meant to fulfill the needs of one or two coffee addicts, not a starbucks. the wand for frothing is short, a 12oz pitcher is fine the tamper is meah, get a 52mm tamper, be aware that a good tamp with this machine takes a long time for extraction it can do single, double or ese pods, the large gasket in the single shot basket needs to be swapped for the smaller one (included in the double shot basket) for a single shot. rule of thumb, if you are using grounds, small gasket. the large gasket is for ese pods, otherwise you won't be able to fit 7 grams. some reviews complain that the single shots were watered down, i suspect the large gasket is the reason, it does take up about 2 grams of space. the ese pods work great, this machine also has a good aftermarket following for customization and parts the drip tray could have been better if it slid directly out, you have to tilt to remove it. everything is manual so you'll have to count to 26 and purge before and after the shot to keep the pump clean over time, theres no backflush on this. frothing wand again is small but works pretty well, prime the wand and wait for it to stop spurting water. try not to switch back and forth between froth and extract, it takes time to reprime and you are running a dry pump during that. temps between froth and extract are different too. cup heater works, takes about a half hour of standby heat and has a lip that keep cups in place, although using the purge water from pre extraction is a much faster way to bring your cups up to temperature. wash out the water tank monthly with regular use using a 1/4 c vinegar and water run a tank or even two when you first get the machine, shavings and fluid may be seen, this is typical",

Rather than placing a hand on top of the machine to steady it while you twist/lock the portafilter/coffee basket in place, the machine is so lightweight that you have to hold the machine in place while trying to lock in the filter/basket. This can be tricky. For my family, definitely worth it!!",

The 1st shot was full bodied and flavorful, with great crema! All the shots have keepers, so far. I bought this machine to hold me over until a part for my 10X more expensive machine comes in from Italy! The part cost more than the EC155! I'm not saying this produces espresso shots as good as a $1200 machine, but it ain't bad at $1100 less!! I can definitely live with it! This machine a great, affordable countertop wonder! I'll continue to use the De'Longhi EC155 after my big machine is back in action. I'll just move the De'Longhi to my studio, as a daily workhorse! As long as I pay attention to the proper 1oz or 2oz shots, use correct grind & tamp (not the standard 30-35lb, just a nice firm tamp like the instructions say), with good quality fresh ground beans, I think it'll serve me well! The milk steamer works well too! The only complaint I have with the machine is that the panarello tip is plastic! Charge $2 more, give us a stainless steel tip, otherwise, no problems! If you are in the market for a cheap, well made espresso machine, take a look at the EC155. I recommend the De'Longhi EC155.",

The first time you make espresso with the machine will be a learning process, but it's not rocket surgery. Follow the directions included and you should be fine. Don't believe all the propaganda about tamping to exactly 35lbs of pressure or using a coffee grinder everytime you brew. All of that is nice, but this machine works fine without overly complicating things. Follow the instructions...or watch a youtube video if you don't like reading. Your espresso will, most likely, turn out fine. The best part will be you didn't spend $500 on an espresso machine ... which may make your beverage even more tasty.",

                "review_text": "I love espresso, and this little baby makes a great cup. Here are a few points that might be useful for you to know: Good points: *It doesn't take up too much room on the counter and looks nice with it's silver metal accents. *The water reservoir is a good size, you can make about 8-10 shots before you need to refill it, which is very easy to do, and there is a clear section behind the basket which shows the water level. *Fast heat-up time (only about a minute), good frothing wand, no wait time between frothing and brewing (though you do have to wait a little between brewing and frothing). Be warned: *Frothing wand is only 3 1/4 inches from the counter top. Not a big deal, I just went and bought a frothing cup that is about that height. *Distance from grounds basket to tray is only 2 1/2 inches, I usually use a small espresso cup. *Built-in tamper sucks, buy a good metal one. *You don't end up with a nice dry puck, the grounds basket is a watery soup after your espresso is made, so I dump it down the disposal. *You will end up drinking more espresso than you mean to, it's that good! Seriously, I chose this machine after a lot of online researching, and decided on this one based on its outstanding reviews and great price. What led me to it were the reviews of another DeLonghi, the EC140B, which is an older and less attractive model, but had reviews from people who had owned theirs for 6 and 10 years! I'm hoping that this one will have the same longevity. -----> UPDATE: I've now had this machine for 8 months and it started running very slow. I'd been using only distilled water, so I knew it wasn't a calcification issue, so I looked into it and it turns out machines like this one (no backflushing) need to be cleaned every month or so to remove built up grounds that work their way inside the machine. So I ran some cleaner through it and all this nasty brownish liquid came out, and now it runs great again! So remember people, take good care of your things and they will take good care of you. A lesson I am still learning... - and to answer a question commented on this review, my tamper is 2 inches in diameter.",

I am extremely happy with the easy of use of the EC155, and with the taste and appearance of the espresso. Having read the other reviews, I was careful to seat the water reservoir properly and to follow the initial cleaning instructions. Within 15 minutes of opening the box, I was enjoying a very nice espresso. Yes, it did vibrate and rattle a bit while brewing, but it was relatively quiet compared to other espresso machines I have experienced. It is far quieter than a coffee mill or most other kitchen appliances. It did not wake my wife sleeping near bye. The crema was dark and rich and the taste was full bodied with no hint of excessive heat damaging the brew. Overall, I could not be more pleased with the D\u00e9Longhi EC155 in its initial use. I will update this review if I have and additional information or problems.",

                "review_text": "Before the review, I should mention coffee is serious stuff around my house. I roast my own carefully selected coffee in more than one way depending on the flavor profile I am trying to achieve. I grind my own coffee immediately before I brew my coffee, and I brew such coffee in a variety of ways depending on the coffee itself, situation, number of people, etc. I have a variety of different french presses, pour overs, a very portable Primula, the Hario cold coffee brewer, an immersion Bonavita, an Oxo Barista Brain, and even one of those horrible Keurigs in my house. So I have a good idea about coffee taste, if it is still personal opinion. I do not drink a lot of espresso, but wanted to have the ability of doing it at home. This had the best reviews all over, unless compared to expensive machines, most of them over twenty times the price of this one, which I would never pay. It is a pressure machine, so unless you modify it (not recommended), you cannot \"dial\" your shots (as in altering substantially the espresso by playing with the grind settings). It is very simple once you figure out the direction of the filter on the porta filter (made that mistake); quick, and it makes a very good looking espresso (or two - it comes with a single and a double filter), with an impressive amount and appearance of crema for such a cheap machine. The coffee tastes very good, the machine is very easy to clean. It occupies very little space and is very light (which can be a little problem as you have to hold the base to twist the porta filter). The water basket is removal which makes it very easy to fill it up. Is it perfect? Of course not. It is made of cheap plastic, and although the espresso is very good, it certainly does not match a 5K machine. It is also very short, which can be a problem when you try to fit a milk frother to make cappuccinos (I have not, but the height is REALLY limited). I also do not know how long this will last, but given the price range, easy of use, and taste, I am very happy.",

                "review_text": "First what I think could be improved: First: It vibrates... a lot. I have to hold my espresso cup in place and rest my hand on top of the unit to reduce the vibration. Second: There's not much clearance for your espresso cup. You can't install the coffee filter with a cup already underneath. Yes, I have three sizes of espresso cups and they all fit fine. You won't be able to fit your tea cup or mug to catch the coffee to make your cappuccino, if thats what you plan on doing. However, you can do it like they do in the bar... froth/steam your milk in your mug then pour your espresso in. Third: The coffee filter comes right out when you turn it over to empty it. I have to grab it in one hand and when it's still moist I have to use my finger to empty it into the trash. You wan't be able to \"bump\" it out like they do in the bar. What I like: * It's nice and small; it doesn't take up much space * It's a real espresso maker (15bar) which means if you use the correct espresso grind you can get a perfect espresso with cream and all! I can make a mean moka, but this machine makes the my moka espressos look and taste sad. :) * It heats up quick. I usually place a cup under the outlet without the coffee while the water is heating up to let the colder water drip out and when the light comes on I put the coffee in and put a new espresso cup I pre heated in the sink with hot water. (I like mine hot) * It includes a second coffee filter that has twice the capacity for when you are making one for a friend or if you prefer, a double espresso",

                "review_text": "I work at a family owned appliance dealership and we sell high end automatic coffee systems. I can't afford or justify the expense of one of these systems, but I have come to appreciate a coffee brewed by forcing hot water through a \"puck\" of fine coffee grounds. The flavor and \"crema\" really is hard to beat. This machine requires that I do the work myself, but brews coffee in the same way that our high end machines do, resulting in a fine cup of espresso or lattes. There are a few cons. Most notably, this is an italian made machine, intended for small european espresso cups. A standard coffee mug will not fit and our large 16 oz mugs won't even begin to fit. I remedied this by purchasing a 12 oz stainless milk frothing pitcher and a 5 oz stainless cream pitcher, both from amazon for several dollars each. The 12 oz frothing pitcher just so fits under the frothing wand and the 5 oz cream pitcher fits nicely under the brew unit. I brew the espresso into the cream pitcher and dump it into a preheated mug, then froth the milk in the frothing pitcher and add it to the mug. It's an extra step, but it is very doable and it's a small price to pay for quality espresso from an affordable machine. Temperature is a bit of a struggle, but it is possible to get a good hot latte if you preheat your mug with hot water. Overall my wife and I are happy with this machine and would recommend it to anyone willing to spend 3 minutes on a great cup of Joe.",

                "review_text": "I've used two of these machines for over a year, both at work and at home. If you want an inexpensive, basic espresso machine then this is a great choice. It's compact, simple and makes a pretty decent cup of espresso. The steamer also works great as long as you don't need silky perfection. As stated in other reviews there are some compromises. You'll need a not-too-tall espresso cup, a smallish frothing pitcher, and you might want to invest in a metal tamper as well. Heat up and steam times are very reasonable, and I've had no issues with either machine (descaled both of them once over the course of a year). One comment on the brew baskets. The ones that come with this machine are pressure compensated which means they are forgiving with respect to dose, grind size and tamping. Some reviews recommend removing the pressure valve. Do that only if you are willing to spend time \"dialing in\" the machine with respect to dose, grind and tamping. If you are using pre-ground coffee (even if advertised as \"espresso grind\"), or don't want to hassle with this, then leave the baskets alone. Yes, you can get better shots if you put in the time, but I suspect for the many people that just want a double espresso for their latte, the out-of-the-box experience is the better choice. And finally, periodically you need to remove the mesh screen at the top of the brew head (where the water comes out) and clean it. It is held in place with a phillips head screw. Over time coffee and grinds back up into this screen and a buildup forms that can impede water flow. Also you should descale the machine periodically if you want it to last. I enjoyed my EC155 so much that I've upgraded to a Breville BES870XL at home. The Breville is a step up in all areas, but for 1/6th the cost it's tough to beat this DeLonghi if you are just starting out.",

This machine, like almost all other low priced non commercial models, does not have the brass boiler necessary to be considered 'high end' or even professional. So why spend $150, $200, or even $300 for something that isnt up to par when you can buy this little guy. They usually work solidly and last for about a year before beginning to wane. You will see a decrease in pressure and after about a year descaling will do very little to help performance. But for that year you- you get a dam good espresso for the price....",

If you are an experienced home barista on a budget, this is a great machine. I also own a Pavoni la Picollo, but I use the daLonghi daily. Pro: easy to use. Requires minimal counter space. Once you perfect your technique, you can make better drinks that you can buy at any espresso stand. Con: The system for suppressing the steam flow starts to let water leak out after a few years of daily use. You can stretch out its useful life for another year or so with hacks, but this part of the machine cannot be repaired. Also, older versions of this model had a larger H2O capacity and could easily accommodate a large steaming vessel. At the sub-$100 price, I just buy a new one every 4 years. I generally keep parts like the coffee baskets and steamer nozzle, etc. My cost works out to about $25/year. The milk, coffee, etc for 48 ounces of latte cost less than 50 cents. Two 20 ounce lattes at a stand cost $6-$8.You do the math on how much you save. And it takes no longer than walking to an espresso stand, waiting for your order and then walking home. Last year I bought a Tesla with what I have saved on lattes in the last decade. Buy this machine.",

                "review_text": "i REALLY love it. i initially ordered a steam based cheap espresso maker, and wasn't satisfied with the performance. After 4 weeks, i decided to plunge down a bit more, with the help of a bit of research, i settled on this EC155. MAKE SURE you PUSH the reservoir bucket DOWN into the unit. it takes a bit of force. But you need to push it down until you hear a click, otherwise you'd be standing there trying to figure out why there's nothing coming out, and nothing is frothing. Pros: the most notable pros that really hit home for me with this unit is it's constancy with frothing. it always comes out perfect, thanks to the powerful 15 bar pump system. i also like the self adjustable valve that allows you to start the pressure low and quickly ramp up as you need. it's simple to use. one knob, one valve. you don't need the manual to figure it out. The Cons i can think of: it's really too bad that the two filters included are not enough to make a double shot equivalent Grande starbucks cup. the biggest filter that's included with the package is only enough to make a Tall size latte. i have a bunch of reusable starbucks grande cups at home, so i use it as a reference. you would have to brew the espress twice to make a grande starbucks cup. the frothing tube IS pretty short. i can see how that can be a problem for most people with regular sized tin cup. for me i use a glass unit that isn't very deep in depth, and therefore fit perfectly. The outlet where the espresso comes out also is pretty short, which could be a problem for some. my espresso cups just fits under it. Edit: May, 8, 2017 ok, after about two years constantly using this thing, probably twice a day at least, it's starting to show signs of wear. i think some kind of seal inside is wearing out, because now everytime after i turn off the pump after the espresso reaches the top, the nozzle continues to drip a lot. so i think some kind of internal valve is starting to wear out. my only other biggest annoyance is the frothing nozzle is too low. i pointed this out in the very beginning and it's still an annoyance. you really just have to get a small stainless steel frothing cup. there is no way around it. the unit shakes quite a bit while pumping out the espresso, so it makes the cup move. you'll have to hold the cup. overall, for the price, and the abuse it went through over the past two years. i would say it's a pretty good bang for the buck. i am guessing this thing might die in another year. i am already starting to look at other pump based units. i was afraid the plastic frothing nozzle might strip out from me taking it off to rins and put back on after each use, but surprisingly it hasn't. the level of crema and layer will also depend on the type of espresso bean you use, the pressure of tamper you press. the harder you press, the darker it comes out, and less golden brown. some beans will give more brown color and more crema than others too. Pete's espresso bean for example is on the more extreme spectrum of too much crema and too brown, while Star Bucks espresso bean more frequently produces the three layers of black bottom, golden middle and crema top. if you're really anal, you can get a consistent perfect cup each time by knowing your beans, and knowing your tamper pressue. but for me in such a hurry everyday, i can live with the slight variations. this makes me really appreciate the professional baristas, and the kind of effort they put in to put out consistent lattes cup after cup. with this unit, my wife and i have drank so many lattes and got to experiment with so many different kind of beans, and variations flavors of lattes (you can experiment by adding your own caramel for caramel machiatto, or Hershey's chocolate cocoa for a Mocha Latte, and many more). this unit really opens up your world without breaking the bank.",

After tinkering with the right ground espresso setting (have your coffeehouse grind the espresso on setting #4 instead of #3), I've had zero problems with this maker and it has delivered above average espresso and cappuccinos every time. I clean it out with a vinegar wash once every three months. It's definitely a cheaper espresso maker option, and it probably could be made of better materials, but it far outclasses a few other espresso makers I tried in its price range. I don't think this espresso maker will last forever, but if it lasts another 6 months I'll be very pleased, especially given how much it has saved me compared to buying my espresso at coffee houses.",

I recommend a stand-alone frother such as a Breville. If you use this strictly for the espresso, you'll be more satisfied with it. The ESE pod feature is nice - I keep some Illy decaf pods if I want an evening fix. For regular (and utterly convenient) espresso, I recommend Illy ground espresso (black label), otherwise, I use fresh beans from a local roaster and use my JavaPresse hand grinder. (Measure GENEROUSLY, and tamp really well). I have experienced occasional leakage under the unit, but it's not a deal breaker for me. I just wipe under the unit after I've cleaned up after pulling a shot. I threw out the metal grid below in order to increase the brewing space and avoid the built-in tamper - which is a hoot. And yes, it is danged loud and vibrates like hell. BUT... Overall, a pretty decent little machine, especially for those new to home espresso machines. I do eye the more expensive machines with occasional lustful thoughts (I'm looking at YOU, BREVILLE...), but the Delonghi simply does a competent job of providing good espresso, without giving me any real justification for a fancy upgrade. I'm not in love, but let's call it a plain vanilla, no frills, solid LIKE.",

                "review_text": "Five stars for the espresso that comes out, three for the design - I guess that makes four stars. I use finely ground espresso (freshly ground, usually) and tamp it down just enough, plus filtered water from the fridge. This produces wonderful flavor, great crema. For the price, you really can't ask for more. Other comparable units cost much more and, at least the ones I've had, didn't produce anything better. My gripes with this machine, after a couple of days, are: - This thing vibrates so much while brewing that you can feel it along the countertop. So the cups sitting under the filter holder are steadily dancing away from the espresso being poured unless you hold them in place as the espresso comes out. (Make sure to have one hand available to turn the knob again to stop the water from coming out, there is no auto stop.) - The filter holder cannot be aligned properly when coffee is in it. It's not that I'm using too much coffee, it's the insert that prevents the full 90-degree movement. No big deal until you don't pay attention to the dispensing holes - which are not aligned with the holes in the drip tray as a result - and have your espresso running into the drip tray instead of the cup. - The machine is not well insulated. ---- All in all, though, I'm happy with this little espresso wiz. I paid about $85 for the machine, which translates into fewer trips to the coffee shop than I've had espressos since buying the machine, so it's a good deal. Until I can afford one of the higher-priced models, I'll be perfectly content with this one. One more thing, for those of you who, like me, don't pay attention to dimensions in descriptions: There really isn't enough clearance for a regular coffee mug. If you want anything other than an espresso (like the watered down stuff called Americano), you will have to pour your beverage from a small container (espresso cup or shot glass) into a bigger cup or mug. Not a big deal but worth mentioning.",

If you prefer a full cup of strong coffee, it's a little painful because even though the coffee grind holder comes in 2 sizes, the 2 sizes are too similar and neither one provides enough room to load a sufficient amount (larger holder is 2'' in diameter and 3/4'' high, if you're lucky enough to fill it without spilling any). 2. The only cups that will fit under the holder are espresso cups, the maximum height being 2 1/2 inches. 3. The \"ready\" light doesn't stay on long enough to fill more than one espresso cup. I've read a review that just says to ignore the \"ready\" light and just keep going, but then the water isn't really hot enough to extract the flavor, so it defeats the purpose. 4. My previous espresso machine would just run until all of the water was exhausted, which I liked because I didn't need to monitor the machine as it was brewing. With this one, you have to be on top of it.",

I splurge and use Lavazza I get from Whole foods. Figure I'm saving enough not going to Starbucks anymore. - bought the tamper recommended on Amazon and it works great. Way better to compact the coffee than the one that comes with it - use Almond milk and it froths super nice - had to raise the unit for better use. A pod drawer works great and looks good too",

                "review_text": "This is a star! We have gone through two Rancillio expresso makers that were over $500 each. Each one gave out after 5-7 years of use and during all that time I was never able to get a good crema from either of them. We decided it would be too costly to mail them in for repairs as each needed a new boiler and we could not replace them ourselves. I decided to try the ROK.....no motor, no boiler, no serious parts to break down and only $200. We used it for over 2 years but with all the preheating were never able to produce a hot cup of espresso and could never get any crema at all so I yearned for the authentic flavor of a \"true\" espresso. The ratings on this inexpensive espresso maker were so good that I was convinced to give it a try.....I am so glad I did. It amazes us twice a day when we have our morning and evening espressos. The crema is there regardless of which coffee you use; it heats up in seconds, not minutes. It does not require a unique touch or twist to tamp the coffee, it simply and easily produces the best cup of espresso we have had in our 15 years of making them at home with some \"state-of-the-art\" makers. I have not used the steam wand because when we used the ROK there was no steaming mechanism available with it so I had to use a different method and have stayed with that method. It is simply using a stainless container with a top that has a plunger with a screen (the link: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X7GF40/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ; after 20-30 pumps the milk becomes frothy at which time I transfer it to a glass container and put it into the microwave for about 30 seconds and that causes it to heat and rise. You end up with fine froth and hot pourable milk which are both required for Cappuccinos. The entire process is fast and easy and we are delighted with the quality of the finished product. You can use this espresso maker to produce just one or two shots of espresso and the turn around time for making more is negligible so you can serve many people quickly. We highly recommend this small (another advantage as it takes up less space than the bigger makers out there) and very efficient espresso maker and let's face, you cannot beat the price!",

                "review_text": "We bought this as an alternative to spending major $$$ on Starbucks. Starting from the beginning, assembly was a snap. All of the parts in the box were either wrapped in foam that tore easily or tape that had little edges that you could lift with your fingers. Once all of the parts were out we gave them a quick wash and then went through the cleaning cycle on the water pump and insides. The video on the amazon page covers this pretty well. In terms of spooling up espresso, the double shot hopper took a little getting used to. The opening is a standard ish size, so you just drop your espresso coffee in there and then tamp it down. I found it was easier to do this while the hopper was in the expresso arm / connection assembly (not sure what it's actually called.) After you put the coffee in it you have to kind of force it into place and then rotate the arm. You don't actually need to rotate it all the way until it's parallel with the knobs on the front, but just enough to hold it in place when the boiling water gets pumped through it. At this point you just make sure you've got water in the tank and then flip it over to \"on.\" There's a little green light that will let you know when the water is hot enough to use. Once you get the green light you flip the knob over to brew and it'll start to pump out the coffee. It'll make about one shot glass worth of espresso before the heat runs out. Also, it will continue to pump the water through until you flip the switch back, so you'll need to pay attention to how fast the cup is filling up. If you're running a double shot you'll need to repeat the same process a second time. Pretty straight forward. After you're all done, there's a milk frother feature that works more or less the same way. Turn it to the \"steaming\" function to get it heated up, and then use the dial up top to control the flow of steam. I'd recommend that you blast the steam a couple times before and after using to get any moisture or cream out of the assembly. Only three gripes I have about the machine: It's really close to the ground, I had to put a box under it so I could get my frother underer the frothing wand. It's really short in general. You've got to use expresso \"shot glasses\" as opposed to actual coffee or espresso mugs since there's about 2.5 inches of clearance from the metal grate to the espresso hopper. You can kind of alleviate this by removing the grate, which I did. It vibrates. A LOT. When brewing espresso. You may need to hold your cup to keep it from moving around or spilling the espresso. Overall, I would recommend the machine for the price. We've had it for a couple months now and I can't speak to the longevity of the pump, but I'll update the review if I run in to any issues.",

It looks always so creamy delicious. And after a while this changed. The cup hardly moves and we don't have to hold it on the plate. The best part of this machine - beside the delicious coffee - is that we don't have to buy the extremely expensive cups. It just needs normal ground espresso. It's cheaper and we are more flexible in buying the coffee.",

I'm giving this version a tentative 4 star rating, only because I'm comparing it to the older version and I am adjusting to the changes! This model is a lot smaller than the previous version, which makes operating it a little difficult. I didn't have any espresso cups that would fit underneath the spout, which was a problem obviously! Currently I am using a small cup that they use in restaurants to serve sides. I am still searching for an espresso mug that is the appropriate height (it needs to be about 2.25 inches or shorter - be aware of this!). The steamer spout seems to be a little easier to operate than the previous version, as I'm not spilling quite so much milk when I try to remove it from the spout. It's still a little shorter than it could be, but it's still pretty easy to operate and no real complaints. I do like the updates in this version. It seems to be a little more \"coffee shop\" in appearances, as it is not so rounded and they added some more of the \"stainless steel\" looking features. I think it is a sexier machine than the previous one, if an espresso maker can be sexy :) I also like the water tank being underneath the back hatch, along with a place to store the extra espresso pod that comes with the device. The only issue with the back hatch is that you have to move the machine in order to open it...if your machine sits against a wall like mine does. Overall, I am thankful to have my morning espresso again...thanks to this machine. It produces a lovely cup of espresso and steams my soy milk perfectly each time. I plan to clean this machine more frequently than I did with the previous one, and hopefully I can make it last much longer than three years.",

It can brew good espresso that has crema. 2. It does the job when frothing the milk, BUT the wand is somehow a little bit shorter, so either you change the wand or you need a rather small pitcher (one that is 10-12 oz and 3.5-3.7 inches in height would be ideal). 3. A friend of mine who has been using this machine for over 1 year says that the original wand will suffer from water leak eventually, he solved this problem by changing the wand himself, which is not a very difficult thing to do. (Or you can just change a stainless wand head, but keep the original tube of the wand) 4. If you want supreme crema, you might want to change the original filter into the non-pressurized one (but from my experience, the original filter is doing pretty good for me). 5. This machine is not good for making a huge amount of espresso/latte at one time, so I would say this is pretty much a \"one person's only\" machine, but it's ideal for small household.",

We\u2019re talking about 2 (occasionally 3 espressos/day). So about 5000. Not sure if that is the normal life expectancy of these things since it\u2019s my first one, but that is the reason for the lower rating. I would have expected slightly longer life out of these things. ****UPDATE**** Got a message from customer service in response to my post. Pretty impressed! They suggested I de-scale the coffee maker which I did. I don't think it helped much since I use filtered water anyway and I think most of the hard minerals are filtered out, but I could be wrong. So I took the whole thing apart and cleaned everything as best I could. Moved some hoses around to make sure they were secure and all. Now it \"seems\" to be working a little bit better. There is still some leaking coming out of the steamer when I make espresso but not as much as before. So I'm bumping it up to 4 star. Again it makes great coffee....when it works.",

Also, I'm not wild about how it vibrates when dispensing the espresso. It is sort of comical to see the cup vibrating and dancing around under the dispenser. I wonder though: does the vibration indicate that something is wrong with the pump mechanism? Still, the coffee comes out nicely and I feel good about that. I hope the vibration doesn't mean it won't last.",

Hesitated about buying another De'Longhi, especially a much cheaper one, but the reviews were good and I liked the smaller, more compact style. So, we've used this at least twice a day for 8 months and it's as good as the day we bought it. Much better value for money than the more expensive EC702. Even if we only get a year out it, it'll be worth it. --------- UPDATE: About a week after I wrote this, problems started. Intermittent pressure and slow or no coffee coming through. We took it apart and cleaned what we could but no luck. Sigh. ----- FURTHER UPDATE: We're on our second unit which we've had for just over a year. I've added two stars because my husband figured out how to fix it when it starts losing pressure! We had the same problems as the first unit after a few months - started getting sluggish as though blocked. He took it apart, gave it a good clean, put it back together, and it's been working like a charm ever since, fingers crossed. We began using filtered water so maybe that has helped. It really does make excellent espresso for the price, and for as long as it keeps working!",

So here we go; Positive: 1. The Value is amazing, I believe we originally received it at target, (just to find a better deal on amazon) for about $79 plus minus some coupons! 2. The maintenance is super basic and also very calming, after you take it all apart you have about 10 pieces, that includes the second \u201csmaller\u201d coffee grind holder\u2026( I don\u2019t know if that is the professional description, however if there is a petition to call it that I WILL SIGN IT) 3. The Control you have is great, you basically say STOP and GO, we have been playing around with the Idea of purchasing an automatic just to sit back and realize that the size and functionality just makes this one better than most of the $700+ appliances we\u2019ve tested. 4. Did I mention the size??? Small and compact! Noone likes clutter in the kitchen\u2026 let me take that back, some people love it\u2026 however we do not! \uf04a The Negative; 1. It vibrates, sometimes so hard that the cup moves and even though its not a big issue it can be if you don\u2019t pay attention 2. It\u2019s a little louder now than what it used to be, however It will not wake up my kids on a Sunday morning, so It cannot be that bad, considering they hear me breathing they come running\u2026\u2026 3. The steamer isn\u2019t the greatest it takes quite some time for the water to get ready and it might come out liquid instead of steaming gas \uf04a Overall if it was a little faster I would probably use the steamer more than I am now, however besides that this little guy will run circles around any Keurig!

(Starbucks just doesn\u2019t do it for me) My stovetop Macchinetta works fine, but it\u2019s just not the same. I have a very limited budget so I thought any kind of espresso maker would be out of the question. I recognized the De\u2019Longhi brand from my time in Italy, and the EC155 was affordable. I was impressed by the reviews so I decided to take a chance and buy it, although my expectations were very low. I am so happy with my purchase! Yes, it is a very basic entry level espresso maker, and yes it may not last a long time, but for what I wanted it is perfect. I am not an espresso connoisseur, but to my taste the espresso is great and I couldn\u2019t believe the crema the machine produced. The short steamer wand doesn\u2019t bother me as I rarely drink cappuccino. The built in tamper isn\u2019t the best, so I bought a separate one. The machine is mostly plastic, so I don\u2019t expect it to last a lifetime, but I think it is exceptional value for the price and the quality of the caff\u00e8 it produces.",

Easy clean of the water container. The wand works incredibly well. MINUS: Plastic instead of all metal Small area for cups Cheap pressing wand (plastic but it works Vibration when it makes the shot. For the price I can't imagine a better expresso maker and I tried a more expensive model (Cuisinart) and liked this much better. The flavor is spectacular and so much better than Starbucks burnt coffee. I highly recommend that you get a hand grinder with a good quality coffee and grind it yourself instead of buying expresso coffee. If you're obsessed you could roast your own beans as well.",

You have to have the proper grind number 1. You have to load the grind in appropriately, unless you are using the pods. I have done both. Loose grind is way cheaper, but the pods are so easy, but maybe not quite as strong, since you can tamp down the grind (if you know to have a tamper, they sell them on Amazon too). You can't allow it to brew too long, weakens the results. I generally use this for lattes for the my wife and me. I tend not to use the wand for the milk instead use a aerolatte milk frother. A great discovery was the find out that lithium batteries really produce great results with the frother...spins much faster and is so much easier than dealing with the wand and its cleaning. I have had this for two years now and am very pleased...it stays on the counter during the winter until I switch to iced lattes in the summer. With iced lattes I add splenda, so I can use just a nice instant coffee which I make with just a little water...really strong and then add ice and whole milk...super.

                "review_text": "I'm on my third machine. Discovered that there is a learning curve to a pump style espresso machine. My first one worked great after I learned to prime it before expecting a great cup of espresso. With no coffee in the basket, run it as if you were making a double shot. This will allow water to flow through the entire system before any real pressure is applied. Then, always, always, ALWAYS verify that you have enough water in the tank! Running out of water mid-pull is disastrous. If it does happen, let the machine cool completely and run it without coffee in the basket several times. You'll hear air escaping when it is running. Once you can run water through without hearing any air you should be good to go with coffee in the basket. Using either the single or double shot baskets, make sure that the compressed coffee grounds are exactly level with the top. I have had good success using the built in tamper by holding the handle of basket holder and using my thumb on top of the tamper to apply some extra pressure. My preferred drink is a Caffe Machiato using just a splash of organic coconut milk with a french vanilla flavor. I rarely use the steam spout. I have found frothed milk to be a bit of pain and time consuming no matter what machine I have used. Keep it cleaned and descale often and it will keep in espresso for a long time. Even with my mistakes in the beginning, each machine has lasted me at least two years. At three Caffe Machiatos a day, I'm way ahead of the curve on the money spent on these machines compared to paying for my coffees my by someone else.",

While I enjoy making my own shots, I found the Italian ESE pods to always produce a reliably excellent shot with perfect crema. I use a wand frother in a cup of milk that I have microwaved, if I am interested in a latte. Usually I prefer a regular shot. The E155 works perfectly with the ESE pods. If you want to use bigger cups, I found that if I remove the perforated metal piece, it leaves me plenty of room for a cup. Heavy cups won't move, but the regular espresso cups move. I bought a rubber pad for the perforated metal piece, and that solved the moving cup. I think most espresso makers make noise, so that isn't an issue. The plastic is fairly breakable feeling, and I couldn't turn the handle to load a shot without holding the top of the machine with my other hand. It seems possible that the plastic will have a definitely shorter life, but for the money, it is worth it. I had to pay more than the cost of this machine to have my Francis Francis fixed, so this is the route I took. The tamper isn't too friendly looking... just buy an inexpensive one, if you want to make your own shots. The ESE pods are all available on AmazonPrime. Try one of the samplers to see what ones you love, and then you can buy a box of you favorite pods. A favorite ESE of mine is Kimbo. If you have the extra money, sure, go whole hog. If not, this machine makes great espresso. For an espresso machine to work well, you also have to clean it regularly and decalcify every month or so. Oh, and if someone made a simple ESE only device, I would happily buy it...for some reason I could find none.",

Not a bad deal if you ask me. It's motor is still working but the pump just gave out this morning. My husband and I took the whole thing apart, cleaning everything carefully but we conclude that a seal in the pump has finally seen it's last day. After doing some research I went ahead and bought the exact same machine, the EC155. I still feel like this is the best value if you want real espresso. To buy an espresso machine that has an automatic turn off the price jumps hundreds of dollars. When I first got this machine I would absent mindedly leave it running and have a mess, but now it is such a part of my routine I can't remember the last time I had a spill. So to me the automatic turn off feature is not worth the money. I use fine pre-ground espresso. I did buy myself a real tamper like many people have suggested but when I misplace it the built in one works fine, although it's not preferable. Over the past four years my husband and I would clean the filter when the machine started to run slow, which was about every three or four months. We really can't clean the filter with soap, water, and a scrub brush, it is still not enough to clear the tiny holes of coffee grounds. My husband discovered that he could take the filter apart, and hold it with plyers, or set it on the ground outside, while washing it with our electric pressure washer. This may sound extreme but it only takes a moment and it does the trick. We probably ran a vinegar solution through the machine about once a year. The coffee still tastes great and I'm looking forward to another 4,380 cups of delicious brew when my next EC155 arrives.",

                "review_text": "If you're shopping for this espresso machine, you're probably a newbie. No problem. The good news: this machine is perfect for you. It's easy, small, simple, and makes very good espresso. Here's what you'll need to go with it. First, you'll need some small espresso/cappuccino cups because this machine pours your espresso straight into a serving cup. Whatever you pick, they have to be low because there isn't much room under the spigot. 7 ounce cups are perfect. You may read reviews that tell you that you need a \"tamper,\" a small tool for pressing the espresso down into the machine. I'm sure it wouldn't hurt, but you don't really need it. The machine has one built in that will do the trick. You shouldn't be mashing your ground coffee down anyway because then the steam can't get through the brick you've made. Next, if you plan on steaming milk - and you should - then you're going to need a steaming pitcher. This one is perfect: http://www.amazon.com/Update-International-EP-12-Stainless-Frothing/dp/B000MR6I9I/ref=pd_sim_k_2. The price is right and this one is suitably tiny, because there isn't much room under the steaming wand. Get this one and it won't be a problem. If you're going to grind your own coffee - and again, you should - then you'll also need a grinder. Yes, you can go cheap on this one. But believe it or not, your grinder is as important as the machine. Cheap grinders spin fast and that speed burns your beans. You want a slow grinder. This one is great: http://www.amazon.com/Bodum-Bistro-Electric-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B0043095WW/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1359610978&sr=1-1&keywords=bodum+coffee+grinder. Wait! What kind of crazy person spends more on the grinder than the coffee machine? The kind of person who wants a good cup of coffee. Speaking of coffee, you need beans. Any beans will do, but you're better off with an espresso roast with this machine. Here is a great espresso roast: http://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Bean-Direct-Italian-Espresso/dp/B002GWFA1Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1359611478&sr=8-1&keywords=coffee+beans+direct. Finally, don't be intimidated, but you're going to need to read the directions. It's simple, but there are a few steps involved. For example, yes, the machine needs to pre-heat for 15 minutes. No sweat. When you're ready to go, there are two trays for the grounds. The big one is for a double (two cups being filled at the same time) and the small one is for a single. You'll need to hold the cups while the machine is working because of some minor vibrations. The complaints about the vibrations in some reviews are way overblown; it's no big deal. For a cappuccino, you fill half your cup(s) with espresso. Then you rotate the dial to activate the frother. Wait until the light turns green, then release the steam and heat a few ounces of milk in your new pitcher for less than a minute. The lower the fat in the milk, the easier it froths. Then you pour your milk and spoon the foam into the cup(s). Easy and rather fun. Don't be intimidated. If you've gotten far enough to start shopping for espresso machines, it's totally worth taking these additional steps. You are going to be amazed by how good the coffee will be. It's a little more work than I am usually up for on a crazy work/school morning, but it is one of my favorite parts of the weekend routine.",

It's a very economically priced machine but does everything you need it to make a fancy coffee... and if you drink Starbucks every day, you can literally more make up the difference in this machine in about a month. I cannot say enough good about this machine and the lattes it can make! The ONLY two negatives: She cannot fit her coffee cup under it for the shots (I worked in a coffee shop, I KNOW it's not supposed to but it does add a cup that must be cleaned and is the only way to really improve this machine for the average person). It's not \"instant\" coffee - but neither is a gourmet coffee from any shop. More than making the coffee, is the heat up time. Takes about 4 minutes from start to finish to make a cup of coffee... but do not let this stop you from getting this machine. I'm being critical for the sake of others, but these are by no means reasons to not buy it. I personally have two young kids, a \"mombie\" as the saying goes... and I've made it a habit to get the toddler and baby out the door early to stop by her house for a latte before work... now I don't even like regular coffee (and loved it before this machine!). Great machine, great price, and highly recommended!",

I use it on a daily basis and it makes a delicious, steamy and frothy espresso. I use Lavazza espresso ground coffee and it tastes really good. I usually make a latte with the espresso and add some caramel syrup to it. I love it and all my friends love it. This is my first espresso machine and maybe for people who are using those fancy espresso machines (like those with separate steam tanks for the milk steamers), this is a low-end machine...but for me, it is really great and because I love latte so much, after having this machine, I gave away my Mr. Coffee coffee maker and my Keurig mini plus, together with a lot of k-cups..lol. I have seen complaints about the steamer not working, and I had the same problem too, but now I no longer have that problem any more. Make sure you follow the instructions and clean the steamer head properly after each use. The milk froth is done in maybe 30 seconds and it is very rich, silky and smooth. The froth can hold a stirrer standing straight in the middle of the froth without letting it fall. I don't think the milk steamer of this machine can make very dry/stiff milk froth, but I don't like that kind of froth anyway. People complain about the machine making a mess..I don't really know what kind of a mess they were referring to, but if you are making coffee from ground coffee powder, there will always be cleaning-up after, and for an espresso machine, you also need to clean the steamer head, the filter and the filter holder every time you finish using them. The cleaning is very easy and I don't use any detergent. Of course if you use a Keurig or any other pod-based espresso machine, it will be faster and easier and there's no clean up after each use, but using this espresso machine is a lot more cost efficient, and the milk froth tastes a lot better than those made from milk pods from Verismo, and I can choose my own favorite coffee bean (even though I have been using Lavazza only lol)! All in all, this is a good espresso machine for people who want to make their own latte or cappuccino (and quality ones..) at home without paying a lot for each cup.",

I've only had it for 3 days but it's pulling near perfect espressos using Cafe Bustello's pre-ground coffee (which I love). 5 seconds for a single, 10 for a double. The coffee is firmly tamped using the built-in tamper which actually gets the job done. The basket seems a bit on the cheap side and is just a bit smaller than my Gaggia basket so they are not interchangeable and I can't use my professional grade tamper. However, It does work and it works well so far. Will update if/when something goes wrong with the machine. The water container is a minor improvement over the Gaggia which, while it held more, was frequently dirty because we'd fill it from the top without removing it. (a hassle)",

I mostly have loved this machine, and after 6 years, I can tell the pump is going out so I came here to review it while I shop for my next machine. I\u2019ve essentially had all of the same issues that other reviewers have had. When you turn the machine on to to heat up, it does leak a little water into the drip basket. I\u2019m not sure why anyone would care about this if it\u2019s going into the basket, but it does happen. The steaming wand does leak for a few minutes after you\u2019ve used it. I just put a napkin under it or left the small rag that I use to clean the wand anyway. I personally wasn\u2019t really bothered by this. Also, like others complained, there is not enough space under the handle to fit an actual coffee mug. This was slightly annoying when I realized, but I bought perfectly sized (and fairly inexpensive) espresso cups at IKEA. Fit perfectly so I stopped caring about this as well, as I usually drink espresso straight and don\u2019t need a full mug. But if you do want to use a full mug, you\u2019ll have the added step of brewing the espresso into one cup that fits, and then having to pour it into the mug you plan to drink from. Overall I could not be happier with the bang for my buck here. Six years of pretty much daily use (double shot). I\u2019ve impressed many guests with my cappuccino skills. If you like to try different beans and brands vs. brewing your fave consistently, I might be a little iffy. I\u2019ve noticed this machine is a little finicky with the higher end, more finely ground brands. I use Lavazza espresso consistently. Tastes great, excellent crema. But when I splurge on coffee like Illy, it does not brew as successfully. Maybe 1 out of 5 would be successful. I tried packing it looser, tighter, using less coffee etc. But it seems the machine doesn\u2019t have the power to push through the more finely ground espresso. You\u2019ll get maybe half a shot out, before you can see and hear the machine stalling and/or leaking, and by this point your coffee is burnt. I think this is a great starter machine. Well priced, consistent (for me), very compact if your kitchen is tight. If you are all about convenience then I would go in another direction, as this model does require a little finesse/TLC to learn how to get the best coffee out of it, but I enjoy this more manual aspect and learned more about coffee in general. After a few weeks I could brew with my eyes closed.",

The only negative thing I could think of is the fact that there is little clearance space for the cup. If you really want to use a larger cup, that could be remedied by removing the little metal cup tray at the bottom. Also, the machine being so low causes a minor hindrance when trying to remove the frothing cup. But like I said, that is minor. You could always put it on top of a book/block/whatever to raise it a little and avoid that 'problem'. The machine comes with two filters, one to make one cup of espresso and the other for two cups. That way, you're not adding too little or too much espresso. I read complaints about the tamper and rushed out and bought one. Honestly, the tamper that comes with the machine is just fine. You're just tampering, not pushing out every single air molecule between the espresso grinds. One of the previous reviewers is from Italy and stated that Italians do not use a tamper when making espresso at home; just a spoon and they tap it a little. So, save your money and skip the extra tamper. You do need to buy a frothing cup, however. But for the price of this beautiful machine, an extra $6-$8 was no biggie. I've had the machine for a few weeks and am extremely happy with it. I bought one for my friend for Christmas and she loves it so far.",

This is not a \"push a button and get a cup.\" machine. First read the instructions and watch several of the nice video reviews on YouTube to show you how to operate it. Several of the negative comments I've read describe things the instructions or reviews address that are easily avoidable. Practicing with the tamper to get the right level of packing will likely be required. I use a metal tamper purchased here on Amazon. Same thing with the steam nozzle - practice a little. I've also used standard Espresso PODs with success. I found that after a few cups I am able to consistently produce excellent beverages. You'll need to be ready to invest a little time for your brew. I allow at least 15 minutes for the water to heat. Don't let the green light fool you. Allow time for the water to heat. Also, open the steam for a moment to allow condensation or other water to drain before placing the frother in your milk. With a little practice the time and steps needed to make the brew just adds to the anticipation. If you haven't used a home espresso machine, there are some good tips available on the internet on things like the time it should take to draw a shot etc.",

There are two downsides however. 1. The thing vibrates quite a bit (at least mine does) while it's brewing. I bought DeLonghi Double Walled Thermo Espresso Glasses, Set of 2 to go with it. But the thing vibrates so much I have to hold the glasses in place as it's brewing or they move around and the espresso will just drip into the drip tray. 2. The steam wand isn't very deep. I bought the New Star Foodservice 28805 Commercial Grade Stainless Steel 18/8 Frothing Pitcher, 12-Ounce and it's very easy to spill the milk after it's been steamed trying to get the pitcher out from under the wand. My solution has been to tilt the whole machine up on that side to lift the wand out of the pitcher instead of trying to tilt the pitcher out from under the wand. However those two issues aside, I would still recommend this machine for anyone who might be looking to cut the cost of that daily Starbucks drink like I did. It works flawlessly and despite those two issues (which are minor in my opinion) it's worth the money.",

There are two things I really struggled with: 1. The milk frother - it is very short and angled in a weird way so it makes the milk frothing process very uncomfortable. You have to find the right pitcher for it - not too narrow and not too deep. The typical frothing pitchers don't work very well since the frother doesn't reach deep enough - it just blows the steam over the milk making it splash all over. I tried the 8oz measuring cup but it was too wide at the top and the milk wasn't frothing well. Also it is pretty cumbersome to clean. 2. In addition, the space between the filter holder and the base is pretty small. It doesn't look that small on the picture, but it really is. You can't fit the regular espresso measuring cups in that space. I had to buy actual espresso shot glasses, so I could measure the appropriate amount of espresso when brewing. The design could definitely be improved...",

The build feels durable enough, but only time will tell how well it'll hold up. The only real 'problems' so far are the height of the machine, and awkward height of the steam wand. I was hoping we'd be able to fit the cups we already have sitting around here, but they're a little too tall, so anyone who wants to use it will need to bring their own. Another issue is the machine vibrating to the point where anyone using it really needs to make sure their cup doesn't rattle off the machine. We kinda-sorta solved the problem by removing the drain plate and dropping a cut out piece of rubber mat that was sitting around our warehouse to deal with the vibration and clearance issues with the dispensing tray.

The pumping noise is moderately loud. Not so loud as a grinder, but certainly louder than a regular drop coffee maker, so you may wake other in the house if they're near the kitchen. Placing it on a rubber pad may help reduce vibration noise (and contain the inevitable mess you will make during your first run). I had trouble cleaning the 2-cup filter because the rubber was glued to the metal casing, which was not the case on the 1-cup filter and as per the instructions, the rubber is supposed to be removable for cleaning. Thinking the rubber was just stuck from the factory, I forced it out and it ended up tearing. I dropped a star because I now have to contact support for a $17 replacement part. Other than that, it's be working very well. The built-in tamper works just fine, and using the correct amount of beans you will get the \"puck\" when you knock the grounds out, rather than the soup that people have been describing. Be sure the grounds are heaping and gently pad them down evenly. Also be sure to wipe any stray grounds from the edge of the filter as you want the sealing surface to be clean or else you'll spray hot steam everywhere. There is no automatic measure for the amount of water you pass through the grinds, so you have to keep an eye on it. While warming up takes a while, the actual brewing is very fast. I usually add grounds and set the machine to preheat before I get in the shower, then once I'm dressed it's a speedy process and quick cleanup. The unit is much smaller than I initially thought. The two cups in the picture are in fact tiny espresso cups. I'm not sure why I expected to be able to fit a normal mug underneath, but be forewarned you will need to buy espresso cups for this, if you don't already own some. The frother works well but is spring loaded. It doesn't stick out like it appears in the picture. This makes it a little difficult to work with, in my opinion. And the added feature of hot water through the frother is confusing and a juggling act to avoid a mess. Also, the frother is only a few inches from the counter top. I'm guessing they expect us to buy the special milk frothing cup. I would actually prefer the frother be removed, since it really just gets in the way. As far as making espressos, this machine is well worth the price. Just let it prime those pipes and make sure you screw the filter in as far as you can (I've yet to fully lock it to the right; it usually ends up in the middle or just past). Never have I had such delicious coffee at home. This will save you a lot of money if your second home is at your local coffee house.",

The espresso has a nice crema and it tastes good. My machine takes only a few minutes to warm up. CONS: - the pod holder includes rubber gaskets that take on the taste of old coffee. I take my pod holders apart frequently to clean them, but the bitter smell remains and some of it gets into the coffee. This may be inevitable, and you can reduce the problem by removing the pod or coffee grounds immediately after making your espresso and rinsing everything. the pod receptacle is made of thin metal and it often sticks into the holder, making cleaning challenging.",

I've pulled espressos with three grounds: Starbucks express roast, Trader Joe's Fair Trade espresso roast, and an off-brand kenyan coffee ground. The first two pulled extremely well with a supreme crema. The last dripped slower than an 80 year old man's prostate-inhibited pee stream. I Four stars, not five: Overall, the process of pulling shots, steaming milk (not simultaneously), cleaning the main area, and cleaning the steamer nozzle takes about 5-7 minutes. Additionally, the steamer is too low, so you'll spill milk when you remove it from your pitcher unless you elevate the machine itself. Don't let that deter you. I've drunk toxic amounts of lattes since I got it. It's incredibly worthwhile if you're an avid latte drinker. Rejoice.",

It does have some good points and bad points. It is a very flimsy espresso machine, but for $100.00 what do you expect. It was very easy to use also. She tried it at our home first, i wanted to make sure it worked ok. I expect it to break during the first year of use, do to the above of being flimsy. Also unless you are very strong it is very hard to get the handle onto the base for the espresso, but im guessing after so many uses it will get easier, but not sure of that. Good for first time users of making the espresso. This is my daughters first espresso machine. It does make good espresso, IF you have the right espresso pods, i bought the Caffee Borbone espresso Pods ESE type you have to have the ones that say ESE. O and this makes coffee to, but we didn't make that, but im sure if you have the right coffee it will be just as good. Hope this review helps any first time espresso makers out there",

                "review_text": "UPDATE: The first was defective and was easily replaced by Amazon. For the price, this is a great espresso machine. You just need to learn how to make an espresso. Just like you would with all espresso machines. The most important thing I can tell you is simple; buy a digital scale, a burr grinder, and watch YouTube videos. The seal for the frothing valve loosens up and you may need to close it a bit tight. The machine needs about ten to fifteen minutes to warm up. I put my small hand towel on the top to help the heat build up. Get a decent burr grinder. If your grinder is a cheapo like mine, you may need to start coarse and grind on a finer setting the next time or two. IMPORTANT: Each bean or blend will need to be grinded finer or coarser and you will measure more or less into your porta filter. My espressos were completely different and rarely good until I bought a digital scale. CONSISTENCY is important. Another reason to always let the machine warm up. Watch YouTube to learn different methods and decide which works best for you. I don't measure my pour because my scale and cup won't fit. Instead, I watch for the cr\u00e9ma to start getting lighter and stop pouring. I highly suggest buying a tamper, because the machine mounted tamper is worthless and you are likely to burn your hand on the group head. FIRST REVIEW: The espresso machine seems to work fine for the most part. Though, this is my first espresso machine, so I don't really know what I should expect. Unfortunately, it has two issues already (within four days of use). The frothing arm leaks and there is also a leak coming out between the front and top plates. I always relieve the pressure when done.",

                "review_text": "I personally use a double boiler commercial machine at home, but my girlfriends mother wanted one and this seemed much simpler to use. Being a coffeegeek for sometime I was skeptical of this machines ability to pull shots, though I think I was just unwilling to step off the dual boiler high horse. This machine warms up fast, is pretty quiet for a vibration pump machine, and pulls evenly. It uses pressurized baskets so you can use pods, and pre-ground and get pretty solid crema. We use it with Lavazza and Illy coffee and it really tastes pretty good. I can say for certain that this will not give you the brighter 3rd-wave coffee quality you see at many up and coming new caf\u00e9's, but it will give you what you have come to expect as solid coffee from a restaurant or what is reminiscent of a brasserie along the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. The milk steaming is surprisingly powerful. Again, I usually use a dual boiler machine that has a separate 2L boiler on 1275w specifically for steaming milk... I was not expecting this little thermo-block to push out as much power as it does. It takes about 45seconds to come to steam temp, which you should flush out if you want to go back to pulling shots. The froth enhancer does as it says, and can be trick to use. I submerged the milk so that the line/ridge was just covered, then cranked the power to get predictable cappuccino foam. Not quite microfoam you would make latt\u00e9 art with, but good foam for a dry cap. The pressurized baskets normalize most coffee's to have a flatter/maltier flavor, and lots of pale crema. If you're a coffeegeek, this is probably not your machine. But its built well, pulls great traditional tasting shots and can steam like a champ. TL/DR; This machine is more than you would expect for the price and size. It pulls predictable shots and steams milk well with ease. There isn't much room to alter the flavor of your coffee, but this pulls a solid shot that most would recognize as \"traditional.\"",

                "review_text": "Update December 11, 2015: Still going! Update July 31, 2014: Still going! There are very good top rated reviews here, and I agree with their high and low point on this machine. I wanted to add two additional items. 1. I've had my machine for three years (April 2010), and although I started with ground espresso, which gave me varied results and a soupy mess, I started using ESE pods and have never looked back! I could not always get the perfect grind/pack combo for a perfect cup, but with the (right) pods I always get perfect crema. I used the now discontinued Starbucks pods, and now the Lucaffe black packaged pods. Cleanup is just a quick rinse of the holder and an empty/wipe of the drip tray. I can power on, make three shots for an iced espresso drink and clean up in about 5 minutes. Just start with a paper towel folded into quarters on your countertop for setting things on, then use it to wipe up when done. Also, don't overextract the pods. Your brew will be weak and bitter. Stop brewing when you have just over one ounce (even though you still see crema coming out). Another 1/4 ounce or so will continue to flow from the basket. If you are using traditional 2oz demitasse cups, this would be stopping at 2/3 cup in order to get a little more than 3/4. Brew one cup at a time. A standard demitasse will reach both spouts. Pods are for a single cup. The dual spouts are for using a 2-cup pack with the grounds insert. 2. I use only RO water, which helps a little with not getting calcium build-up. An unexpected benefit I've had with ESE pods (in addition to quick prep, quick cleanup and consistent results), is that I've never had to run a cleaner through the machine, since grounds are never free to get into the jets. So yes, ESE pods will cost you at least 0.50 a shot, but there's no ground coffee to wipe up, rinse out, or clean up after, and the machine won't get clogged from grounds. I make 3-9 shots a week. It only takes from the time I turn it on until I've gotten my espresso cup down, my larger cup ready and my pods out until I have the green light to brew (about 2-3 minutes). After I empty the espresso into another container, remove the spent pod, insert a new pod and reattach the handle I get the green light at right about that time to start the next shot. Very fast recovery. The only problem I've had started about four months ago, where coffee started leaking into the handle and dripping from the end onto my counter. This seal is after the pressurized area, so it wasn't affecting brew, it was just making a mess. I went out and bought food-safe (it may be labeled for aquariums), silicone sealant. I took the handle apart and ran a bead around the mid-lower basket, where the metal top and bottom portion go together, reassembled, and wiped away any excess that leaked out. Since resealing the basket, I haven't had any more leaks. I would highly recommend this machine for anyone looking to spend less than $120 on a machine, and would buy it again.",

Pro's: Easy to use It's pump driven so it makes coffee like the big boys (without the expense) Heats quickly Small enough to fit under any counter Makes a wonderful, thick crema I love using the espresso pods - quick, easy, no mess Frother is easy to use, easy to clean Cons: (Which really aren't cons for me since I've worked around them) Short distance between base and grounds basket. I use shot glasses which fit nicely Vibrates while pumping which causes your shot cup to slide across the base. I place a folded paper towel under the cup and use it for clean-up afterwards Short distance from frothing wand to counter. I've placed all my coffee gadgets and machine on a thick wood-block cutting board and use a 12 oz frothing cup. The \"built in tamper\" is a worthless piece of plastic. I bought Terry's Tamper and it works perfectly Now, after all that, I am on my 3rd machine. The first lasted 5 years. I did very little to take care of it except to flush it a couple of times. The heating element finally went bad. I took very good care of the second , followed all the required maintenance, but the pump was wonky after we moved. (rough move!) My 3rd is working great. The thing is, the machine I'd like to have is well over $1500.00. I can go through a dozen of these little guys and still not have to pay that much money and I couldn't ask for better coffee from a machine that is so compact and easy to use.",

As a first-time purchase, this is the best machine to start with. I just want to cover a few \"first-timer\" issues.The only reason I don't give this product 5 stars is because the manual needs to be a little \"dumbed down\" for lack of a better phrase, but for the most part it does give you the basics. Here are the challenges you'll need to be prepared for: 1) Learn what REAL espresso tastes like. The comments here from others with expertise are enough to educate anyone on what good-tasting espresso is! 2) I finally learned the problem with setting up the water reservoir. It's not clearly explained here because it's not easy to explain. Others have said that when you fit the reservoir tank back in after filling it with water, press down hard. This may not be enough. That is because there is a small, pointy part within the machine that must not only make contact with the rubber-encased opening of the reservoir, but it must puncture it clearly and firmly. This may take multiple instances of removing the tank and putting it back in over and over - at least for me, it did. It took about 6 times before I got espresso for the first time. I almost returned the machine! 3) Use distilled water. It not only keeps the machine cleaner but your espresso and cappuccino will taste better 4) DO Keep all parts clean every day! Don't be lazy, as I was during the second week of use. I stopped cleaning my frothing wand and as a result, it stopped frothing! 5) DO read the manual the first two weeks. It will help you, as it did for me in the above item #4.

Get a 12-ounce frothing pitcher, a smaller one is just not enough. I've tried three tampers so far and the \"Blue 49mm Espresso Tamper Stainless Steel\" is the closest, though it is a tiny bit small. We go through between one and two lbs. of coffee per week, and about every three months it is important to de-calcify the EC155.

I don't remove the frothing wand to clean it except for once a week, I fill the little frothing pot I bought at the same time with hot water and steam it clean, wipe it down and it's good to go. Like others, I use distilled water because we have very \"hard\" water in our area. I run a couple of plain water shots thru the machine every other day as well, and have as yet not gotten a lot of gunk coming out. To pull a shot, I remove the metal insert beneath the drip and place a doubled paper towel in the well and drip into a rattleware 2.5 oz shot glass, My large mug would fit under the drip if I wanted with the grate removed. As far as warming goes, I fill our mugs with hot water to pre-heat them ~ no big deal. I've only had the machine for three weeks so can't speak to long term use and will update this review when it has some age on it, but so far I am very pleased to recommend it. I'm saving $$ and love being able to have Espresso when ever I want it. Trivia.....I live 22 miles from the nearest small town (44 miles round trip to the coffee shop!)

You'll need a 12-oz pitcher as the steam wand is close to the counter-top, or elevate the machine on top of something. * The machine is very easy to use. There is one notch to pre-heat for the espresso shot, and another notch to pre-heat for the steam wand. Just turn the knob accordingly and pre-heat each setting (shot or steam wand) for 2-3 minutes. Easy enough! * It takes about two water bottles to fill up the water tank. One can get about 3 beverages (with 3 shots in each beverage) before needing to fill the water tank again. * Overall: It's been reliable, very consistent and very user friendly. My only complaints would be the steam wand length and how close it is to the counter-top. I also wish it gave thicker foam but wasn't expecting THE BEST frother when I purchased this. It takes 3-4 minutes to make a cup of espresso after preheating - but that may be because I need 3 shots! A little time consuming but SO worth a good cup of coffee in the morning, you deserve it!",

There are a lot of variables (bean roast, pre-ground vs whole bean, syrups, etc) but with a little patient experimentation I think you'll be enjoying your favorite drinks in no time. I paired this with a hand grinder which also works great: Most Consistent Hand Coffee Grinder & Coffee Press - Ceramic Burr Grinder made with Professional Grade Stainless Steel. Manual Coffee Grinder - Perfect Coffee Grinder for French Press, Espresso or as a Spice Grinder or Herb Grinder. and the 12oz frothing pitcher: Update International EP-12 Stainless Steel Frothing Pitcher, 12-Ounce In hindsight I added the thermometer as well: Norpro 5981 Espresso Thermometer I also picked up a 3-pack of Jordan's Skinny Syrups from a local retailer and found them to be quite good for sugar free. Amazon carries a variety of these as well. I hope the list will help if you're looking for the latte/cappuccino package like I was! I had checked out the more expensive all-in-ones but didn't like the short lifespan on the units. If I'm going to pay $500+ I expect years of service, not 1.5 average. So for just over $150 after tax I'm cranking out some great drinks. *The only issue I've had so far was that when it arrived, the steam knob was VERY tightly closed, it took some effort to get it to spin, but it's working just fine.",

                "review_text": "I love coffee, and a co-worker recommended this machine (along with Lavazza coffee) when I told him I was thinking about getting a espresso maker. At first I confess that I was disappointed with the machine. It's noisy, more than I expected, but then again, I think all espresso makers make noise, right? It's also kind of high-maintenance if you follow the manufacturer's directions for cleaning (which I do, because I'm borderline OCD). That said, after owning this machine for many months now with mixed feelings, I finally had a change of heart today. Turns out that I wasn't using the right kind of coffee. If you want the crema on top, make sure you buy a coffee that says so. I was using the regular Lavazza Cafe Espresso and I never really got that creamy top that I was looking for. Then I came across the Lavazza Crema & Gusto, and voila - my coffee is now perfect! So tip #1, if you want coffee with crema, buy a coffee that says \"crema\" because you won't get that with any coffee (at least I didn't). Then, tip #2, if you, like me, don't know how anything about tamping the coffee, learn about it. I did a google search and found really good instructions in writing and on video. They really made a difference, because you don't want to tamp it too hard to too little. Then, final tip, don't use tap water if, like me, your tap water is full of minerals. You can taste in the coffee, and it's just not worth it. Overall, it's a pretty decent machine - not too bulky and does the job, but I wish it was less noisy and a little easier to clean. Also, when this one dies, I'll buy one that will grind the coffee and that will allow me to brew several cups one after the other. When you have people over it's a bit annoying that you need to change the coffee grounds at every cup (because if you don't do that the coffee comes out a watery mess, so keep that in mind before you buy).",

                "review_text": "Update November 2016: I've started to use it every day, and over three years later, it's still going. Don't tamp the coffee. That will let it flow faster and give you better crema. Leave a plastic cup under the steamer wand. Make sure to turn the steamer knob all the way off. That's mostly what makes it leak. In the summer, when I don't use the steamer, it stopped leaking after a while. Run the steamer until it runs \"clear\" in order to avoid too much water in your milk. Take out the tray when you want to use a tall cup. Put a quart container yogurt cover on the tray to keep small cups from moving. I only make one cup at a time because the drip is not even from the two spouts. No big deal. There does not seem to any point in buying another machine at this price; apparently they all have problems. And a three hundred dollar one is probably not any better. This one is still working well enough for me to enjoy espresso two or three times a day. No, it's not perfect, but it was only a hundred bucks, not fifteen hundred. Another update: June 2016. I figured out that to make it work, I couldn't tamp as tightly. I end up just knocking the basket on the counter to settle the grounds and not even tamping from the top. When it starts to drone, I turn it off, release the handle, and then tighten it back up, which helps. The coffee really isn't bad. Not that hot, but nice crema. However, It is starting to pour water out of the steamer spout while the coffee draws, and it is leaking from the bottom. So really, it is time for a new one, and I suppose three years isn't bad. I'm still not happy with the frother; only one in every four or five tries does the milk really thicken up and not just get bubbly and thin, even though I bleed it first, but I manage. The hot milk increases the temperature of the coffee. So I'll probably end up getting another one. . . . . This is an update: I see that I bought this in June 2013. I haven't used it that much, maybe 25 times. Now, in January 2015, the water won't come through the filter, even though the pump drones and drones. I have taken the filter apart and cleaned it ten times. WASTE OF MONEY. Previous review: I let the water heat for fifteen minutes; I rinse the cup with hot water. It's just not really hot enough, no matter what I do. There are other issues, like the frother is a little difficult to gauge accurately, and it's true that the cup moves around on the drain. But I don't care about those things; I don't expect perfection for the price. But I do care about having a cup of espresso that is still hot when I move it from the machine to the table.",

                "review_text": "Just as others remarked, this is a great little machine THAT HAS SIGNIFICANT DESIGN FLAWS! It is small, which is great for our small kitchen. The unit heats more quickly than the instructions suggest. Not just any espresso cup or shot glass will work, as they all get stuck under the drip spout causing your fresh espresso to spill. I am using a very old espresso cup and must bend down at the level of the counter top to estimate how much espresso is made. Very difficult to judge. Despite this, it does produce a very nice balanced crema if you can figure out how many seconds it takes to pull a good shot. The instructions suggest 25 seconds, which is too long & produces a weak tasking espresso. The frother is a hassle too! It does swivel, but the normal sized stainless frothing pitcher I own is too tall. I think a shorter pitcher might overflow if you're not careful or experienced with frothing milk. I even use coconut or almond milk, and it does a beautiful job. It makes lovely frothed milk, but after you manually turn off the device (which isn't a quick process either), you must lift the entire unit up off the counter by the handle or pull the unit to the edge of the counter to pull the steamed milk container from underneath the wand!! If you don't mind these hassles or cn adapt after a few spilled milks, it you can make professional tasting lattes, cappuccinos and espressos (if you don't mind the truly homemade experience of a product that is too compact for \"normal\" cups/shot glasses or steaming pitcher.) I do recommend strongly buying your own tamper. This machine includes a plastic tamper, which is basically a good idea, but for a properly prepared grind you must apply 25 pounds of pressure in tamping. You can't with this machine affixed tamper, or you will knock it over. Overall, I wish I had purchased the bigger unit; however, I can produce delicious and consistent drinks every morning from this small machine despite the hassle of the frothing pitcher and espresso cup not fitting AT ALL!!",

                "review_text": "Added January 24, 2013: The pump died after eleven months of use. Contacted DeLonghi, they offered a warranty replacement but I had to pay s/h costs. Took them about a month to send a new unit. Meanwhile I bought a Breville BES830XL on sale and have been using it instead of EC155. The Breville is easier to operate but also far more expensive. I see no difference in the quality of espresso. ---------------------------------------- I bought this product as a replacement of my 15-year old steam driven espresso maker. Both my wife and I are tea drinkers, we drink coffee in the morning mainly as a \"caffeine delivery system\" to help keep us going, but we do appreciate good flavor. According to experts, pump driven machines produce better tasting coffee than steam driven ones, so I decided to give it a try. In the under $100 price range, the EC155 had by far the best reviews, which influenced my decision to buy it. I ruled out anything with the price tag well above $100, which in my view is a ripoff of snobs who do not know what to do with their money. I tried a few of these overpriced coffee machines at a local Williams Sonoma store and I do not think that the quality of coffee they produce is commensurate with their ridiculously high price. The product is designed to make European style espresso - which is served in 50mL cups. This is about 1/4 of the US cup (240mL) - so the concept of a \"cup of coffee\" can be a bit deceptive here. This machine will not make a \"cup of coffee\" of the size of a mug - it will only make a \"cup of coffee\" of the size of a shot glass. This answers frequent complaints about the design of the machine, especially that the clearance between the filter holder and the base is to low. It is not - it is a perfect size for 50mL coffee cups. The machine comes with two sizes of coffee filters - for 1 and 2 cups of coffee. Since my wife and I like our coffee strong, I found the 1 cup size unusable since it produces coffee too weak to my taste, but it is a subjective opinion. Others may find coffee produced by the 1-cup filter satisfactory. However, a negative side of it is that when I make two coffees, as I usually do, I need to empty the 2-cup filter and refill it with coffee before making the second cup. It is not a big problem, however, because it does not take much time. In fact, it takes less time to make two coffees that way using the EC155 than it does using a steam driven maker (which takes about 10 minutes to produce the same amount of coffee.) Although some reviewers complained about the built-in tamper, I found it adequate and rather easy to use. This is a plus, since the tamper is always there when I need it. The pump is a bit noisy, but I found it to be the case of other pump driven machines as well. The negative side of it is that it also produces vibrations that may cause the cup placed under the filter holder to move. Again, it is not a big deal and requires the cup to be held by hand during the few seconds when the pump is in operation, but I think the design of EC155 could be improved to reduce these vibrations. The EC155 has a mechanical function selector (steam, preheat, dispense, off) which I consider a big advantage over electronic controls. The latter are notoriously unreliable and prone to failure, and when they fail, the whole appliance needs to be thrown away. This happened to me several times, and I tend to avoid electronic controls like a plague, especially that they usually add a lot of bells and whistles - and thus inflate the price - without adding much useful function over mechanical controls. The main useful add-on of electronics is a built-in timer (which the EC155 does not have - see below), but a $6 external timer will make up for the absence of a built-in one. According to the user manual, the machine needs to be preheated by at least 15 minutes, which is a drawback, especially for morning coffee drinkers. I experimented with two different methods of dealing with this drawback. One, mentioned in the user manual, entails running the hot water \"empty\" (i.e. without coffee grounds) several times as soon as the green indicator light goes on. The other one involves using a simple $6 kitchen timer set for about 1/2 hour before my wake-up time. I found the second method to be a time saver. I also used a side-by-side comparison of coffee made by my old steam driven machine and the EC155, using the same amounts of ground coffee (two 7-gram (0.24 oz) measures supplied with the EC155) and the same amounts of water (about 60mL or 1/4 of the US cup). The EC155 produced rich crema (foam on the surface of coffee) which the steam driven machine did not. That matters quite a bit if you like espresso, but not that much if you prefer cappuccino (as both my wife and I do). I did not detect any stark differences in flavor, but in a blind comparison I picked coffee made by the EC155 as slightly better tasting one than that made by my old steam driven maker. On the other hand, the EC155 produces much better froth than the steam driven maker. However, the EC155 has the tendency of spitting out a small amount of hot water before producing steam for frothing (which the steam driven maker does not), which may produce watered down milk. This drawback can be easily corrected by quickly opening and closing the steam valve before placing the pitcher under the frother(you may want to place a sponge under the frother to capture the water). I also noted that emptying the used coffee grounds from the EC155 filter is more difficult than from my old steam driven maker. I have to tap it really hard several times before it starts coming out in small pieces, while it takes only one or two slight taps to empty the filter of the old machine. I am not sure, however, whether this is a design flaw or merely a difference between the pump driven and the steam driven mode of operation. In sum, the EC155 is not for making larger quantities of coffee to fill the standard US cup (240mL) - or the coffee will be way too weak (at least to my taste). It is designed to produce small shots of coffee about 1/4 of the standard US cup. The coffee produced by the EC155 tends to be slightly better than that produced by a steam driven maker, but the difference appears to be small. Finally minor drawbacks (the need to preheat, vibrations, and water initially coming out of the frother) are the main reason why I give the EC only 4 stars. Otherwise, it is a good value, especially in comparison to some of the ridiculously priced products on the market.",

I read the reviews and ordered this 5 months ago with some reservations. I probably run it 6-10 times a week (doubles, 3-5 days). I have only used ESE pods so far. (mostly Lucaffe). Overall, it's been great--but I wanted to add some information about some of the other comments. - Portion size - coffee. This is not made for American-sized portions. No 16 oz here! When I make a double, I use a single size espresso cup because that's what fits. I can fit a small mug if I take out the bottom over the reservoir. - Portion size - milk. Same with the frother - I use it with an old-style 1950s coffeecup, which is broad and shallow. If you're looking for a Sbux amount of milk, it won't be enough for you. If you're looking for espressos or americanos, it's much better. -Cleaning the frother. A lot of people complained about that in reviews. My advice: don't remove the attachment to clean it. It's spurting boiling water after all--better to take a clean cup, add a bit of hot water and soap if necessary, and run the frother again to clean it. I found that ended up cleaning it better than taking it off. About once a month I do pull it off and make sure nothing's stuck under the threads. Haven't found anything so far. -Operation. The machine does shake--and the plate the cup stands on can vibrate. I find that I have to watch it or it shakes the espresso cup out from under the machine. Sometimes I keep my finger on it. I have had very little trouble with warm-up or with readiness - I find it takes me less than five minutes to make a double. The handle often won't go all the way to 90degrees--but when I used a commercial machine when waiting tables ten years ago I had that same problem as well. Don't force it; make sure it's in the grooves and push it as far as it goes. - Water. I have hard water, and at one point my filter pitcher broke so I was using straight tap. Warm up time doubled. Once I started using filtered water again I cleaned it out and it's been fine since. I highly recommend using filtered water. Huge difference. -Selection. Overall, I find the selection of ESE pods excellent. Although this isn't really about the machine, it did factor into my decision to purchase. TL;dr: If you mainly want a decent, low-fuss cup of espresso, this is a machine for you! If you mainly want cappucinos or lattes, you may want something else. If you are Truly Serious about your espresso, this probably isn't enough for you. Also: use filtered water and small cups.",

Well, I'm coming back to add to my review on July 1, 2015. I've had the espresso maker for a little over 3 years, and the seals are starting to give out. While it makes great espresso for a while, it won't last you a lifetime. I didn't use it for about 6 months, so don't know if that had any effect on it. But it recently started first to leak water from the milk steamer, and now it will barely push the water through the coffee pod. I emailed the company in Seattle that repairs espresso makers, and they said for the amount I paid, it wouldn't be worth sending it to them to have the seals replaced. So you have to weigh either investing in a much more expensive machine, which will eventually need the seals replaced, or going for this inexpensive one and expect to replace the machine every few years. So because of the low price compared to other machines and the great espresso I've enjoyed the past 3 years, I still give this one 4 stars.",

I use it daily for 5~8 brews, so combined, these 2 machines have provided >15,000 cups of nice espresso. The Pro-Con of all the 5-star reviews applies to me as well. So I will just put a few notes about how I use it. -- Grind of the coffee bean is very important. It makes a lot of difference even with the same bag of beans. My own experience is \"as fine as possible\" but not to the degree of clogging the filters. And adding a thin layer \"not as finely ground\" and then the \"very finely ground\" helps produce amazing result. ... So you should experiment what kind of grind you like best. -- if you leave water tank in the machine for too many days, the bottom will become slimy. So I take it out and rinse it everyday. I also flip the whole machine upside down to drain out the remaining water under the tank, that place gets slimy as well). Note that this kind of problem will happen even to those costing >$1k. Billionaires take showers too. -- Warming up is necessary. However this can be accelerated by pumping out a cup of warm(hot) water. You can dump it into the drain (I drink it), and that helps warm up the cup nicely as a bonus. -- Remember to wash the filter(s) once a month, if not more often. Don't forget the one that is attached to the machine which you need to flip the machine over and unscrew. -- I have a toaster-oven right next to my EC155 and I put my cup on top of that as my cup warmer -- Buy a couple small sealed boxes/jars and grind your beans for 2~ days use (I got two box, one for decaf) -- When there is a hissing sound, and getting louder, it means scale is building up. Time to descale. I add white vinegar water (1:4) mix and let it sit in the boiler for 30 minutes. -- the built-in tamper work fine for me, although I have to hold down the machine with your left hand while pushing up the cup with your right hand. 15 lb is quite a bit of pressure, so you need to press with some force. -- After my 1st EC155 died, I did a bit of research on those high (5~10x) priced machines, and found that: 1) all have 15 BAR pump, this number turned out to be \"optimum\", so higher BAR is not better!! 2) boiler unit may be more powerful (EC155 is 1.1kw), but typically not by much. Since my 1st EC155 died of a boiler related problem (still pumping, but water cold), I see higher power boiler as potentially counter productive; 3) expensive machines tend to be bigger or taller and I have limited space in my 50+ year house. so it turned out EC155 is the optimum for my needs. so I bought the 2nd one.",

I bought the Squaretrade warranty so I wouldn't have to care about it dying on me. Regardless, this machine rocks. There are goofy videos on the tube about how to get the best coffee out of this. One moron insists that you should let this warm up for \"20 minutes\" to fully heat up the water. That is nonsense. To zap fry the water to super-boiling temperature in a jiffy, turn the dial to the LEFT to the \"Steam\" position and let it run its cycle (takes about a minute or two). THAT alone will heat the dihydrogen oxide to 7 trillion degrees (and compete with a particle accelerator). Then BOOM, twist it all the way to the right and you'll get superheated water. The key to good cappuccino is a good grinder. Yeah - a true coffee snob would say this machine is crap but they probably roll with a $1500 machine. ***Edit 19-Jan-2015*** The pump in the machine is no longer effective. How coincidental that it dies almost one year since purchase. Thankfully it is still under DeLonghi's warranty along with my Squaretrade. I'll update my review if they screw me over.",

My only complaint is it won't fit my 8 ounce cups but if you buy shot glasses or those little 4 ounce cups you're golden. ALSO I was a barista at Starbucks where we didn't use manual machines so this was a learning experience. If you're new to this I suggest watching a video tutorial on YouTube- it's not that hard.

                "review_text": "Overall: This machine isn't going to put your local barista to shame, but you can get a decent espresso with it. I'm glad I bought it, but might not be so happy if I had paid $75-80 for it since I also had to buy a small espresso cup and tamper in order to successfully use it. Pros: 1) You can get a decent coffee with crema. 2) I got mine from Amazon Warehouse deals for under 50 bucks, which is probably cheaper than a dozen espressos from a coffee place and I don't have to leave home to get one. 3) If you enjoy badly conceived instructions, you can get some jollies reading an Italian company's Chinese produced manual. Cons: 1) The instructions give 3 different timing versions of how to make an espresso. Trust me, IGNORE THE GREEN READY LIGHT. Let the machine pre-heat for at least 15 minutes, preferably with the coffee/pod already installed. The ready light kicks on within a minute or two of turning the machine on, but if you don't wait for the machine to fully pre-heat, you'll get nasty dishwater. 2) The machine nozzles are insanely low. You can only get a small espresso cup under the nozzles. This is a pain and I had to buy a special cup to make espresso. 3) The 'built-in tamper' is worthless. You need at least 20-30 pounds of pressure on the grounds to make a decent espresso. Since the machine only weighs a few pounds, pulling the grounds up on the tamper means you also have to be pushing down while pulling up, and keeping the grounds in place with a squat machine very close to your countertop, and well, you get it. Nearly impossible to do correctly. Buy a tamper! It makes a huge difference. Caveats: 1) I don't make lattes, but the steam gizmo does shoot out steam, so I guess it works correctly. Since the machine is so squat, it may be difficult to use without buying a very small pitcher. 2) I don't use the pre-packed espresso pods, so don't know if they work well or not, but would think they do. 3) I roast and grind my own coffee, and have not tried this with grocery store grounds.",

This machine makes genuine espresso with a nice crema. It\u2019s labor-intensive. It\u2019s manual so you need to monitor the process closely. The machine has a built-in tamper, which is convenient, and the drip tray is easy to remove and clean. The filter holder is easy to clean for multiple sequential use. The metal quality of the filter is very good. Lots of plastic in this machine but that is no surprise for the price. Be aware that the machine does not come with any cups or receptacles for the espresso. My own method: I heat a shallow bowl in a microwave while the machine warms up. (The clearance requires a shallow receptacle.) I then use that bowl to make the espresso while I heat 1/3 cup of nonfat milk in the microwave. I make more than two espresso shots because my goal in the end is an Americano. (I know that the dilution of the espresso at the front end is not ideal but I am happy with the outcome. I also use a regular grinder for beans instead of a burr grinder but it works well enough for me.) Once you perfect your own method, the machine can fit your needs. One problem is that the machine shakes in the brewing process so I put a bar towel in front of the bowl to stabilize it during the brewing process. My ultimate point is that high quality espresso makers cost thousands of dollars and require significant maintenance. This machine costs under $70 and the quality is very high relative to the low price.",

The Breville had all the bells and whistles including a built in burr grinder, so there was a lot to fail. I will talk about this first: the Breville's burr grinder hit the dust first, and after numerous cleanings and attempts to get it to be OK, we gave up on the grinder. Even though we cleaned it regularly as recommended, there was another failure which I would assume was a seam that gave way. We had already replaced the grinder with a $9.00 rotary type which works great. After reading the reviews of this machine we decided to try it and forget all the arty things we could get. This is a solid, no-nonsense little workhorse. Makes a good cup of espresso with the requisite crema, and the steam attachment does its job to make nice foam. It also foams more quickly than the more expensive machine, thus does not add much water to the milk, contributing to the taste of a good latte. As it's built in Italy, home of great espresso, I have high hopes that it will continue to do a great job, as we will maintain it carefully. Drawbacks: first time I used the steam button on top, I had to turn it open with a pliers as it was so tight. Now it's fine. Also, the directions are not great but good enough.",

We joke at out house every time we make a latte, we are making $5. As someone expressed before, the frother is a little awkward, but I have learned to work with it. As for the espresso, there is a technique that needs to be learned, and it is some trial and error as I work toward mastery. I did some research about how to make a better latte, and it made a great deal of difference in the quality of my brew. I did buy a tamper, but now just use the back of my spoon, however, I do use a thermometer when frothing. It is an easy machine to use and maintenance is straightforward and specific --a key element to facilitate the longevity of any machine. It works like a champ every morning. This is my first espresso machine, so I have nothing to compare it to other than my numerous observations at Peet's.",

Same with the filter holder. Just have to break it in without...actually breaking it, lol! It's overall really great and makes a nice espresso. Especially for this price. It's an excellent choice for home espressos and lattes. Sometimes I just grind the beans a little more coarse than for an espresso and tamper lightly for a regular cup of coffee.

Like others have said, it's important to turn the machine on well before you are going to use it, I aim for the 15 minute mark. The other biggie is to steam the milk long enough. I was cranking that knob on the top wide open thinking that would make the difference but nope. Now I turn it just a quarter turn and am listening for the steam sound to change from a high pitched whine to a low rumble. I have used all sorts of non-dairy milks, my favorite is hemp milk, and it works just fine. It comes with two different sized containers to put the coffee in, the thing in which to tamp the coffee down and becomes the puck at the end (?). Anyway, I use the larger one and run it twice to get two shots. I don't know if this is how you're supposed to do it, and some of you coffee aficionados may be appalled, but it works great for me.

                "review_text": "After 7 months (Christmas to July) , it is still running strong, and we have not had any problems. We are not espresso-philes, and we only make espresso on the weekends; therefore we have not run the machine hard. However, we have run it long enough for any vices to appear, and I see none that warrant a reduction in rating. I do not give many five star ratings (reserving five stars for the extraordinary, and no product is either the best or the worst ever), but this deserves five stars BASED ON VALUE. Highly recommended for the casual espresso fan, those on a budget, or with limited space. The unit is very compact and does an amazing job for its size and cost. Some of the knocks against it in other reviews are legitimate. The frother is annoyingly long or short - depending on how you look at it. The bottom of the tip is not high enough above the table top to allow you to slide most pitchers or cups under it without raising the unit or seriously tipping the pitcher/cup. Also, the tip is not long enough to really bury it into the milk. It is true that most cups will not fit under the unit to receive the espresso from the machine; we just press it into small, heated espresso cups and then pour into the larger cup when the milk is ready. However, these vices are ones I've learned to live with, and I am now able to froth milk to a nice paint-like consistency on a regular basis, starting with a pitcher filled halfway. The frothing tip is made of soft plastic and, as mentioned elsewhere, it is easily possible to strip the threads on it when screwing it back on after cleaning. Haven't done it yet, but probably will. I will either order a new tip or buy the metal nut that someone else mentioned in a review of the unit. But you know what? The solutions are a larger, more expensive unit; I think the DeLonghi engineers did the best that could be done given the price and size parameters. You want perfection? Go spend an additional $700 on a professional machine. The unit is kind of loud and vibrates when building up pressure for a couple of seconds, but nothing that is going to wake the house. How do you steam milk without making noise? Actually, I kind of like it; it's like the little train that could. We have not had any of the leaks that others have complained of. I have broken it down for a cleaning per instructions, and it is easy to do. Buy a three-year extended warranty for next to nothing in case you get a lemon. Overall, and for the price, this is a great machine. No problems after 7 months, so mechanically sound. It does what it purports to be able to do in a very compact unit. I mean, for the cost, how can you beat it? I'm impressed enough that I have just ordered a grinder to improve the experience. I think anyone whinging about this DeLonghi either got a lemon - and that happens - or doesn't know the rule of getting what you pay for. Again: for the price, this is a great machine. Recommend the Lavazza esspresso bricks; we've tried the single-shot pads from various companies, and the DeLonghi doesn't like them nearly as much as hand-packed double-shots.",

Don't let the price fool you - At the price I purchased it, $99, in every way this is a high quality, home espresso brewer that makes perfect espresso shots every time. Without fail it produces espresso with a wonderful crema top, is quick to start up (around 15 min if you wait for it, less than 10 if you do a pre-brew to heat it up faster) and easy to use. I have over filled the filter, under filled it and everything in between testing the right measure of grounds in it and it still consistently produces perfect shots. The steam wand for frothing works great for heating up the milk and although I have yet to master the art of frothing the milk perfectly, the wand itself works wonderfully. I have managed to make great froth a couple of times, but I attribute my failures to skill not the machine. Highly recommended machine for the espresso addicts - especially if you can't afford to keep up your vice via cafe shops XD",

The Breville died and I started looking for another espresso machine. We got this one for ourselves as a Christmas present in 2009. It has been used pretty much at least once a day since. I have espresso every morning, on the weekends my husband joins me and we have two. The espresso turns out great, the crema is nice, the machine is smaller and lighter so leaves a smaller kitchen footprint. We haven't had any issues, find it easy to clean, and I would recommend this for someone who just wants a dependable machine that delivers good espresso and doesn't want to spend 1000 dollars. For the freshest best tasting espresso I grind my own beans using the Kitchenaid grinder KitchenAid Pro Line Series Burr Coffee Mill, Onyx Black For this demonstration I used the Hues n Brews espresso cups Hues & Brews Espresso Cups/Saucers, Tangier, Set of 4 The pump failed on the Dec 2009 purchase in June 2011. We decided to buy another one based on the price of the machine and the quality of the espresso. *updated 9/9/2012 Sadly the pump failed again at the 1 1/2 year point. We do make a lot of espresso. I decided to move on and tried the Phillip's saeco, pump failed in five days. Tried the super expensive la pavoni manual lever machine, hated it. We decided at the price of this machine and the quality of espresso we get from it we'll just replace it every year and a half.",

Therefore using a regular cup or mug with this machine is nearly impossible! - unless you're using your kid's toy china collection ;). Also, When the machine is pouring out the drink it vibrates so much that I have to hang on to the cup i'm using, otherwise it'll vibrate itself out of position and thus miss the spout.

I make chocolate latte espresso, Use the single size grind filter, fill up a 1/3 cup of espresso, add to 2/3 cup of steamed whole milk, add 1-2 tablespoons of chocolate syrup. You can add seedless raspberry jam to this for an extra treat, chocolate/raspberry. For another variation, add 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the top of the pressed grind for a cinnamon flavor. Homemade chocolate syrup recipe: Mix together; 1.5 Cup Sugar, 1.0 Cup Cocoa, and a 1/8 teaspoon of salt. Boil 1 Cup Water; the add 1/3 cup to the dry to create a paste, then add 1/3 more incorporate well, then add final 1/3 hot water stirring well, until you no longer feel gritty sugar. If needed, heat in microwave 10 seconds at a time, stirring in between, repeating as needed until all is well dissolved. Then add 2 tsp. Vanilla. Keeps well in the fridge, in a tightly sealed glass container for up to two weeks. Let me also suggest this for your coffee, Cafe Bustelo, available in many local grocers in the coffee isle or in the international or Hispanic section, very low price, or here on Amazon; http://www.amazon.com/Cafe-Bustelo-Coffee-Espresso-10-Ounce/dp/B001E95KLK Update 2016: Still going strong, this is a work horse! 15 bar is 15 bar, waste your money if you want, this machine just works!",

                "review_text": "I checked out many machines before taking a chance on this one. I had a steam type espresso machine for years, and also a Delonghi coffee\\cappuccino maker. The Delonghi machine finally was worn out after about ten years of steady use, so I felt the brand was reliable. The first cup I made with this new machine was excellent. In the few weeks since I purchased it I have been very pleased with the quality and taste of the espresso, and truly enjoying every cup. I grind beans finely and have used a few different coffee brands so far. I have no problem frothing milk with a small metal pitcher, andIi find I can use a low height wide coffee mug to make the brew in and it will produce a good cup of strong coffee (not quite espresso strength)that is creamy and tasteful and is equal to about 2 1/2 shots of espresso. This makes a great morning drink for me. I put in the cup a shot of half and half, and a bit of sweetener before adding the coffee and it comes out perfect to my taste. Even looks inviting. I have made espresso in demi-tasse sized cups and that too is very good, but I enjoy a larger size cup so I opt for the wide mug recipe. This is a great machine so far, especially for the price, I am glad I got it and did not spend 300 or more for a fancier and seemingly higher end model. I highly recommend it to all but the most \"fanatically obsessed\" espresso drinkers. You will save a lot on fancy coffee bars with this unit. Added 2017.... I have had this machine for many years now. It is getting a little worn..the seals I guess. It drips when on and not running. But it still heats great and makes a superb cup. May have to buy one again. Added 6/17: Finally gave up on the old machine. After twice a day usage for 6 years it started to leak badly. I just bought a new one, same model. It is noticeably quieter and of course does not leak.",

                "review_text": "I lived in Italy for half my adult life and went \"native\" upon arrival Naples. Caffe' for me is a way of life, not just a breakfast beverage. Until I bought this machine in April for $80, I was using a heavy duty Krups machine for 20 years. Had the same machine in Italy and friends still use it in Naples. When I laid it to rest, I was leary of buying an Italian machine because of the European running joke about Italian mechanical anything being job security for the fix it folks. This machine blissfully contradicts that old wisdom (hope you're listening FIAT). They must have hired German engineers to match the italian design. The caffe' is authentic, with a perfect crema everytime. Though my life changed with the introduction of cappuccino in the 1980s, I actually haven't brewed one on this machine--Latte is fine for me. The taste of the crema I'd forgotten on my old machine and the use of the stovetop caffettiera. For the first 6 weeks I had this macchina bella, I had latte 3-4 times a day. The smell was exquisite. I can't better the reviewers who detail quantitatively the benefits and cons of the EC155. I can speak to the authenticity and incredible value for $80. A proposito--Do yourself a favor and get Lavazza or Illy Caffe' to use in it. Illy is ridiculously expensive but good and is used (or was, before the recession) at all the finest bars (cafe's). Lavazza red or higher is wonderful for 40%-%50% less. The perfect grind every time and authentic. (Amazon has a subscription that beats whatever you can get locally.) Chin Chin!

I read many of the negative comments and I recommend that people read the instructions that come with it! Many of your issues would be solved by reading the instructions. The warming up process is important! It makes for a nice warm espresso! The right temperature! We decided to get it because we believe there is nothing like these manual machines! The foam on the espresso is just right! As for the steam: well, I agree that the spout is a bit short...solution? Well, I just use a smaller Frother! We have to keep in mind that this is a mini espresso maker and is under $100...so I think you need to set your expectations! Just keep that in mind. We make cappuccinos and they turned out amazing with a nice thick foam...it's also all in the milk. Let's hope this machine lasts! Because if it does, it just fits the bill for what we need.",

                "review_text": "I rarely review products, well that's not true, my wife will tell you I have an opinion for everything, but rarely do I post my opinions online. I like product research and when my second Mr. Coffee espresso maker quit functioning as it should I was on the hunt for a new one. Now I've only been through 2 of those machines in ~10 years, so I'm plenty pleased with their longevity, however, I've also used some pretty expensive machines and there are amazing. So I thought I'd shop my next one a little. All the reviews are pretty good, some just whine with one star so I threw those out and 100 bucks verses $40 versus several hundred, the EC155 seemed like a reasonable deal. Well... At first, I was surprised at how small this machine was when I unboxed it. Then I thought, ah but less intrusive on the counter...that will get me points for not taking up so much space in the kitchen. I like the removable water reservoir that hides inside the machine, but at first I didn't see how I was going to know I was out of water. Look closely at the pitcher and you will see the water window gauge to the left of where the cup sits. The problem being, that's where the steamer carafe sits and out of habit, I check the water level right as I'm finishing steaming my milk. So no big deal, I'll change my habit and take a peek down there now. The big problem I have is how small it is. Seriously, I can't get my regular steaming carafe nor my espresso cup/carafe under the relevant apparatus. Yep, that's my big complaint. This machine is tiny. I'll get a new catch cup and a new steaming pitcher, but it just feels so tiny to operate with these man hands. So why 4 stars...because the end product is what I'm really after and this machine makes amazing espresso for lattes and cappuccinos. Upgrading from a steam to a pump driven system makes more of a difference than I was previously willing to admit. You can actually see the layers of crema and it tastes awesome. A note about the steaming wand, besides it being so close to the counter (in height), the arm is sort of \"spring\" loaded and wants to return close to the machine. I, personally, find this annoying. Also, the arm's reach down in the pitcher is really short, so during those times I use less milk, this short arm makes is more challenging to reach the milk. Now...with that said, the milk steamed up really well and the \"aerator\" on the tip wasn't as annoying as I thought it was going to be (I usually use it without but this one doesn't appear to be removable). The froth was nice and thick and easy to make. The biggest upgraded from my last machine was that the milk came up to temperature quite quickly. So at the end of the day, I would recommend this espresso maker. It makes great tasting espresso drinks. Upgrade your steam driven maker and you won't be sorry. Just take heed, this machine is small, so if you do find a machine similar to this, that is a little taller, buy that one.",

                "review_text": "I purchased my 1st machine about 2 months ago and have used it to make 2-3 drinks a day. I liked it so much I purchased another one, from another vendor, for my vacation home. Unfortunately, I got 2 duds in a row-both duds expelled steam and water(up to 3 oz) in the warm-up phase. The machine should NOT lose any steam or water in that process. I was able to get another one that works properly from Amazon and I am again pleased. Starbuck's brand espresso, ground on the turkish coffee setting, is still to course to get a good cup of espresso on this machine. Medaglia D'Oro works much better. I have also had success with Fairway espresso beans ground at the espresso setting. Both are flour-like in consistency. If I had a grinder I would try a little bit coarser grind but not by much. I get very good crema with both those coffees. The frother works great. A few videos on Youtube and some practice is all you need. Better to do the milk prior to pulling the shot so that the coffee is still fresh. This machine would be better for me if there was more height for the cups so that if I made a latte/macchiato I would not lose the crema when pouring from a shot glass. Cups that are 2 1/2\" slide under without tilting. You can remove the stainless steel drip tray and slide in a cup about 3 1/4\" in height. Also, I would like either more space under the frother to accommodate a larger pitcher or a frother that can tilt out at an angle. You can use a 12oz pitcher but it must tilted slightly to get in and out. I have placed the machine on a piece of wood to increase the height from the bottom of the frother and the counter. Another solution is to place the machine close to the sink so that the frother swings out over the sink. All in all, it is a great machine for money.",

                "review_text": "I have had this brand new machine out of the box all afternoon. I have read the instructions through repeatedly. I fill the tank, I know it's on the valve correctly. The filter holder is in place. But when the \"OK\" light comes on and I turn the knob to the dispensing position, the pump runs but nothing ever comes out. This is brand new, so I can't believe the boiler output is already clogged. How long is this thing supposed to crank away before dispensing something? I know that the steam wand works, but for some reason no water passes through the filter holder. I am also appalled to read in the instructions that the thing is supposed to be on 15 minutes, and then another 30 minutes, before brewing. Are they crazy? Do they expect me to set up and wait 45 minutes to brew 2 ounces of espresso? Are they serious? I had a lot of hopes in this machine, having worked with a steam espresso maker for years. I was looking forward to making the real thing. I guess I have to wait. --- UPDATE: Amazon's excellent return service is wonderful. I filed for a return/replacement and today (Nov 3) I have the new unit. Set it up and I've had way more espresso this afternoon than any sane person should. I'm jittery, wide-eyed, my bladder is shot, but this is wonderful espresso. Really hot, which I like, nice crema, the milk wand works well especially with the 12 oz milk frothing pitcher I ordered with the first unit. Since I just make this for myself in my office and sometimes for a colleague, the capacity is nice. I also happened to have a nice set of china cups that fit perfectly under the filter holder. ____ So all's well. I give this unit 4 stars. My only CONS so far are: *the low clearance-though my nice cups fit, I wish I could put a mug or small pot under there-but see below! *I wish the frothing wand was higher and longer so I could froth more milk. What it does is okay for me now, but I wish I could do a little more. Otherwise, happy camper. _____ Another UPDATE: The only complaint I have had with this machine has been, as others have said, the narrow space underneath that restricts the size of cup you can use. Well today I realized the obvious. You can just lift out the cup tray and you immediately get another .75-1 inch of vertical clearance, more than enough for most cups suitable for a double-shot espresso or latte. Just a simple tip, but it has greatly increased my enjoyment of this machine.",

                "review_text": "I worked as a barista for about a year back when we had to actually pull the shot by hand so this was not a difficult machine to figure out. I recouped my investment in less than a month since i no longer need to stop at at the corner for my morning latte. I'm throwing the cash I save into a jar for other things. Tips: - FILL THE WATER TANK BEFORE EACH USE It's a habit that will save your machine. - Get a tamper, the built in one is a joke. - Buy a couple of good shot glasses for pulling the shots. - Put the machine on a small stand. The steam wand is quite low to the counter. - Buy whole bean espresso roast and get it ground for an espresso machine, regular coffee from a can will not do. -Don't smash the grounds into the holder. A light but firm packing is best. - Don't bother with a fancy frothing pitcher for this unit. I froth the milk in the same sturdy ceramic mug that I use for drinking my latte, when the mug wall is too warm to comfortably hold, the milk is almost done. -Keep the milk level about halfway up the steam nozzle. When you're almost done, bring it down to the bottom of the nozzle to get your froth. - Pull your shots after you froth the milk, and dump them in and enjoy. - You can pull shots right after frothing but not vice versa. - If you are a syrup user, you may want a frothing pitcure. 3 pumps of syrup for 12oz, 4 for 16oz, and 5 for 20oz. Peppermint users may want to back off 1 pump depending on your tastes. This is a great starter machine. With care I would expect an everyday user to pay for their machine many times over ($5 latte / day = $35 a week, do the math). UPDATE 7/12 - I celebrated it's one year anniversary recently. I do not use distilled water, but I do clean it regularly and have had no problems with it. Blatant Plug: I use Urnex Cleancaf Coffee Maker & Espresso Machine Cleaner and Descaler to keep my machine clean. I use the Amazon subscription service for my Coffee Bean Direct beans and Torani syrups to save the most money.",

I am still experimenting with how fine a grind to use and how much tamping pressure to exert, but clearly the machine does not have the kind of pump pressure that you would find in at coffee shop machine. Given that, it cannot easily penetrate too dense a charge of coffee in the head.

Pros: Much quicker than running a few miles away to Starbucks, and it's just as good Super easy to learn how to use Setup doesn't take long (once you put the water in and start heating it up, it's ready to go fairly quickly) Cons: The built in tamper is not that great - I bought another one for like $8. The frother seems to take a bit of time. I don't care about froth so I always just put milk in the microwave while I make the espresso shots. I wish there was about another 3 or 4 inches of height. Not a huge deal to work around, but I would love to get 1 4oz cup under there instead of using 2 separate shot glasses (2oz each), but I can't find a bigger 4oz cup that is short enough to fit. So for now I just use the 2 separate shot glasses. Overall, this is one of the best purchases I've made and I would buy it again in a heartbeat! (and recommend it to everyone else!)",

Here comes the EC155. I only use this machine for ESE espresso pods and frothing milk. Very quiet and powerful pump. Heats up quickly and the steam wand is surprisingly strong! I don't like the plastic auto-frother, but it does create nice froth. I use it with Intenso Aroma DI Caffe Forte Espresso E.S.E.

Does the company test them before shipping them or was this a return? I am thinking they test them first so I used it anyways. It is a process to make the cappuccino. But the frother works great. I still need to perfect using the frother. I have tried to make my cappuccino taste like the coffee shop's, but it isn't near there yet. I have a typical blade grinder for my beans, and yes I know to get a higher quality burr grinder but I have to use this for now. I don't know what they have or do but I find I may never duplicate the flavor of the coffee shop. It's a shame. BUT, the built in tamper works just fine, I think it does the job. The machine is small and compact so there's extra room for cups and stuff on the counter next to it. The colors are nice. Black and silver. It doesn't vibrate too hard while brewing, the cup stays in place. The water pitcher is easy to remove but it can be filled just left in too. The instructions are easy to read, and once you get the hang of it a couple times you won't need them anymore. I'm glad I bought this because I get a strong brew something I could never get with my previous machine (Keurig) and that's because I love cappuccino's! A little thing I do is make my froth BEFORE I make my cappuccino coffee, I think it gives the coffee better flavor. UPDATE: so I've used this little machine for awhile now and I needed to come back and let you know that I stopped making the froth before the espresso because it could burn the coffee by getting the water too hot, so I make it the normal way and it works perfectly. I have since perfected my cup of cappuccino by making better froth and by adding a hairs pinch of cinnamon to it. It is less than a pinch but it gives it a smoother flavor! So I am very happy with it!",

I thoroughly read the various reviews here before I chose which machine to buy. It took a variety of methods of tamping the grounds before I came to the method which works best for me. I had lived most of my life in Miami, FL, so I was used to walking up to a window on almost every block of every street, and getting a cafe' cubano (50 cents) or a cafe' con leche (75 cents). So that is the flavor I like in my espresso; thick and rich, but I do want a nice layer of crema. I purchase either Bustelo or Pilon, already ground, in the can. (Miami Cuban coffee). Call me lazy and plebian if you wish; I love the flavor, and the grind is just perfect. I make two espresso cupsfull at the same time. First I preheat the espresso maker about 15 minutes. Turn it on, and go do something else for a bit. I use the two cup holder of the machine. Insert it, and dispense the hot hot water into the two cups I am going to use. This preheats the holder, and the cups. Dry the grounds holder - careful, is HOT! Then I fill the holder with one scoop of coffee grounds, tap tap it down to settle the grounds, then press firmly with an old tamper that I have from my last machine by someone else, I dont even remember whose machine it was. I don't use the tamper that is attached to the machine. (following what all the reviews on here said!) Then I add the second scoop of grounds, tap tap it to settle it down, and tamp that down as well. Clean off the edge so there are no grounds to interfere with the seal. It is filled just below the rim. I insert the holder tightly into the machine, and dispense the espresso into both my preheated little cups at the same time. The left nozzle seems to give a little bit more, a little faster; maybe because the water holder is on that side? YES, you have to hold the cups still, or they will dance. Actually, I fold a paper napkin on the grate under the cups, and they stay still. YES, it makes noise. So what?! This is NOT a $5,000 machine! I want it to make the coffe I like. Let it dance and moan, I dont care! I find that I am able to get two well-flavored strong cups of espresso, with a nice layer of crema. I had to play around with the firmness of tamping down until I got it right. To me, for this price, it is a great machine. If it falls apart after a year, I will have gotten my money's worth, and will get another. You just have to fool around with the pressure of tamping and amount of grounds to suit your taste.",

I read up on many reviews and finally concluded to purchase this espresso machine and I am glad I did. Both the espresso maker and froth/boiler work great. It is soooo convenient that the water tank is removable, love this feature. As far as the espresso it makes goes, I can't say anything bad. I roast my own beans so it probably helps. I have given brief pro's / con's which pretty much go along with other reviews for this machine. Pros -Pretty easy to clean and the tray is removable. -This machine comes with two cups -Heats up pretty quick (~2 min)....although you probably want to let it sit for a bit longer so that the grounds basket also heats up Cons -I don't use the built in tamper, wish they provided this separately, oh well no biggie. -The only thing with the frothing is that I have to set the machine on top of a pan so that I can get under the wand to froth the milk. Pretty low machine, but this also allows me to place it under my cabinet. So I like how it is : ) -Note that you will have to use a 2 oz espresso cup as the height (grounds cup to lower tray) will not permit you to fit a 4 oz cup.",

                "review_text": "It's been about a year since I bought the EC155 and I decided it's finally time to post a review. Our house makes up to 10 doubleshots per day and it's still going strong. With an average of 6 shots per day over the last year, that's 2,190 shots. I looked into buying this because my girlfriend and I were spending at LEAST $8/day on lattes. I didn't want to give up my delicious morning lattes, but I really couldn't afford to keep spending the $132/month for coffee. So I looked into making Espresso at home and haven't looked back since. If you're like I was and want to experiment with homemade lattes, this is a great machine to start with. Making Espresso at home is fun and novel for a while, but stops being worth it unless you're really making good shots comparable to the coffee shop, or its 1am and you're desperate for espresso and everything is closed. It is completely possible to make lattes comparable to a coffee shop using this machine, but there are a few requirements. This is a semi-automatic machine and you will be learning how to pull your own shot of espresso with it. This also means you can make a horrible shot. You will probably make a lot of horrible shots. And then you will (hopefully) realize what you are doing wrong, and the shots will start to become great. Don't expect to pull it out of the box and instantly make something great. In fact, the most likely thing to happen is you actually start making mediocre shots and feel the machine is only mediocre, when you could somehow improve and make great shots. You need good beans, and you need a good grind. This sounds really simple, but it isn't necessarily. The best coffee you're going to make with the EC155 is from beans you grind right before making your coffee. I paired the machine with a Rancilio Rocky, which is considerably more expensive than this guy (3-4 times more expensive in fact). My justification was, even after I upgrade the EC155, I will keep the Rocky. The Rocky is an excellent machine, but there are probably (somewhat) cheaper grinders that will get comparable results. But I can only speak to my setup and the results I've gotten. The only downside to not grinding your own beans is they will go stale much faster than grinding yourself. This just means you need to buy smaller quantities more frequently. I think it's worth the tradeoff if you aren't sure whether the grinder investment is worth it. I've praised the machine quite a bit, but there are some downsides. A traditional non-iced latte calls for steamed milk. The steam arm on this machine is really low and hard to work with sometimes. It steams and frothes milk okay, but it can be a pain to work with and clean. We usually make iced lattes because of this. The temp indicator on the front, which tells you when its ready to go, goes on briefly for steaming, and then off again, and then some time later comes back on when it's actually ready to make espresso. This can be really confusing at first and there probably should have been a better indicator. This can contribute to bad shots if you start pulling a shot thinking its ready (like I did at first). The machine's vibration actually moves the espresso glass around on the drip tray. I accidentally solved this by buying 3oz espresso shot glasses that stick up around the portafilter, so it holds itself in place. I watch the cup dance around and then get filled with espresso every morning. If your shot glasses are not this tall, you will probably have to hold them in place. This can be very dangerous because they get hot, and if you slip you can be burned. Related to the above, you cannot fit any sort of regular cup under the dispenser area. Like at all. This worked for the shot glasses I bought, but it's really frustrating tiny if you want to dispense into anything other than shot glass. Even the tiny metal steaming pitcher I have won't fit. Lastly, I specifically mentioned lattes (normal and iced) earlier because I don't usually drink straight espresso or Americanos. Putting the shot into any sort of milk removes a lot of the specific flavors of the shot, which can be good and bad. What turns out to be pretty good lattes may only be a mediocre shot of espresso. I can't really comment on that, so remember that in regards to my review. Pros: -Can make a great shot if you're willing to learn with it. -Really durable, has made over 2000 shots in the last year. -Excellent starter machine. But It's is not a $600 machine. It's great as long as you aren't expecting that. Cons: -Takes time to learn how to make great shots with, especially in learning the pull time/grind needed. -Small platform for cups/shot glasses. Can't find regular sized cups. -Vibrates a lot. Your mileage may vary and if you're experienced with espresso you might prefer a more expensive machine, but I've enjoyed it and think its a great machine for anyone looking to start making espresso at home.",

Cons: 1) the machine vibrates like crazy when brewing and rattles my cup all over the plate. I have to hold the cup in place risking burns if anything goes wrong during brewing. I'll probably fashion some way to keep the cup from moving around (some day... probably after I get burned). 2) there is always water inside the machine which lhas eaked from water holder. This is my second EC155. I used to remove the reservoir after each brewing (I don't like standing water) but I finally figured out that the water in the pipes keeps leaking out (all over the place) after a brewing so I quit taking out the reservoir. I don't know why water still leaks from the reservoir even when the reservoir is in place. But judging by the drainage hole at the bottom of the reservoir holding area DeLonghi expects leakage (or at least planned for it). So if you take the reservoir out to empty it, don't leave it out... water will (in my experience) leak from the pipes out onto the counter. 3) the frothing nozzle (which I don't use) is always in the way. It rattles against the cup when the nozzle is pinned against the machine or the nozzle interferes with taking the 'handle' out after brewing.",

The metal cover also moves under the cups so I actually had to tape it down.

                "review_text": "I purchased this from Amazon warehouse deals, paying 64 dollars with the possibility of \"5 percent cosmetic damage'\" and the only cosmetic issue I see is faint paint on the steamer dial. I fired this bad boy up today running through the 5 basically water coffee runs to prime it and clean it out. I ordered Lavazza crema de gusto Italian espresso as another review stated, a 12 oz stainless steel pitcher for steaming, a thermometer for milk, a tamper, and De'Longhi shots cups. Overall I think I paid 110 for all listed. Cons: Yes the steamer wand is small, but it works for a 12 oz pitcher, anything bigger probably would need some accomodations on the edge of the counter. * The metal plate under where the espresso comes up, I had to move it, in order to have enough depth for my shot glasses to fit, but that's easy, and not such a big deal. * The instructions make you feel a little bit overwhelmed, but when you get started it's second nature (I did own a coffee shop once and when I got started...it felt great!) Pros: PRICE! * Ease of steamer wand, like I said I owned a shop and am very picky about good foam, Even getting used to it, was a quick process. * I ordered the Lavazza espresso in a three pack, I am so glad I did. I noticced the first shots I pulled had a dark color, no crema, so I looked to the manual, second time I loaded the shot fuller, tamped it a little harder (not to much, with a good twist), and it was beautiful! * Ease of cleaning: Not too much to take off, dump espresso, rinse, unscrew the steamer wand plastic tip and rinse it after steaming out a bit after pulling from milk. * TASTE: WOW, I crave lattes that remind me of handmade as when I had my shop, big name places and little places often don't offer consistency, this latte today with a couple spoons of sugar made me so excited, it was so much better than any I have had in a very long time, since I owned an industrial machine myself. Tips: Order equipment to go with it, read the instructions, use distilled water to prolong the life of the machine, and clean it daily (maybe even look up espresso cleaners), keep a towel by you when steaming, if its a wet one, you can wipe the steel wand off and get the milk off immediately (think coffee shop barista :), get a good ground espresso, I highly recommend the Lavazza. Yes I have only owned this for a few days, but having a shop where I made drinks for a living, I had a high expectation, and in the comfort of my home, it is absolutely met!",

                "review_text": "This baby makes a great cup of espresso. However, to get a great cup of espresso, there are a few RULES you MUST follow: -- First, you MUST tighten the handle REALLY well. I mean REALLY well. The only way I can get this tight enough is to literally turn the machine around so it faces away from me, bear hug it, hold it with one and and crank it tight with the other hand. There is no other way I can get it tight enough. If I do NOT tighten it this way, I end up with a far less superior cup of espresso. If I use pods, I end up with a soggy pod and little crema. If I use ground espresso, I end up a pool of soopy grounds, and little crema. Now that I have gotten used to the process, it doesn't bother me much. However - if i had known this before i bought it, I probably would have chosen a different machine. If you want to just leave it sitting nicely on the counter and not bear hug your espresso machine every time you brew a cup, you may want to look at other options. To make a great espresso, this machine requires a \"hands on\" approach. -- You MUST buy a good metal tamper to go with this if you plan to use ground espresso. The plastic one attached is junk. -- Regarding soupy grounds. Other reviewers have complained about soupy grounds and not getting a hard puck after brewing. See above -- they are not tamping their grounds enough, and not cranking the handle so it's tight enough. If you tamp the heck out of the grounds and crank that handle tight, you will get a beautiful dark rich shot with a beautiful layer of crema. Every single time - but only if you follow the the rules --TAMP WELL AND GET THAT HANDLE REALLY REALLY TIGHT. -- Pods vs. ground. I have only used Lavazza pods, but both ground and pods make delicious espresso, so long as you follow the rules - tamp & tighten. -- Steamer -- you definitely need a short pitcher to accommodate the short wand. -- Other PROs = small footprint, large water capacity, quick heat up (especially if you put it on steam first) -- Other NEGs = have to hold the cup while it brews or else it will vibrate out from under the spout In summary - this is not as convenient as I would have hoped, with the turning, bearhugging, and crazy cranking of the handle every time. Honestly, I would prefer to just heat it up, turn the handle without bearhugging it, and brew a shot. But, it's not enough of an inconvenience for me to return it. And, for the price, it makes an amazing espresso. So -- weigh the pros & cons and decide if bearhugging your machine every day is enough of a turnoff to get another machine. I swear -- I cannot get a great cup without doing the bearhug.",

My criteria: >Price; I couldn't spend over a hundred dollars >Convenience; If it was too difficult, I wouldn't use it in the mornings >Ease of cleanup; if it was too hard to clean, I'd let it grow moldy and crusty, and chuck it in the garbage when it became a health hazard (the fate of my previous coffee pot.

I've been using the De'Longhi for over a month now, on a daily basis, and am shocked by how easy it is! I really expected it to take a lot of trial and error to learn how to (a) brew espresso and (b) froth milk, but I succeeded on my first try. Granted, the first couple of cups had a slight burnt taste, but they were drinkable. Bear in mind that I chose to start with espresso pods while learning, but just received a grinder for Christmas and feel ready to start that as well. The instructions give a couple of different options for operation, and I've seen a lot of advice from users, so I'll throw my own process in to the mix. Maybe there are more refined and hoity-toity methods out there, but mine has been fool-proof (literally) so far: Step 1: Pour DISTILLED water into the chamber (tap water will cause scaling later on, and since I've already admitted I'm a pig you know that I would never clean it, and end up breaking the unit). Step 2: Place an espresso pod in the basket. Step 3: Turn on the unit and wait 15 minutes for it to warm up (do NOT pay attention to the green \"ready\" light; I'll explain below.) Step 4: Place an espresso glass or shotglass under the tap, with a bit of flavored syrup in it, and turn the dial to \"brew\". DON'T WALK AWAY! Watch, and turn it off after a couple of ounces have brewed (about the contents of a shot glass). You can go longer, but the espresso will become lighter in color, and taste weaker. Step 5: I then immediately brew a second glass for my daughter, but ONLY because she does not realize the second cup is weaker and doesn't taste as good. The \"correct\" way would be to use the double basket, or another pod, but I'm cheap. Step 6: Froth the milk in the mug I'm going to use (I use skim and it froths great). I tried the small frothing pitcher that was recommended by another user, but this wand is very low to the counter, and I found it clumsy. Also, it was a bit hard to get the wand down into the bottom of the pitcher. My small mug work just fine, and doing so also serves to preheat the mug and requires less dishwashing (pig, remember?) I dip the wand in just far enough to submerge the end and move it around. Once the milk looks good and frothy I dunk the wand all the way in for about 5 seconds, to heat up the rest. Step 7: I pour the espresso into the edge of the mug, so I don't displace much of the foam. Then I drink it and tell everyone on Facebook that I'm a fancy lady who has a cappuccino maker in her kitchen. Cleanup is a breeze; so much easier than a regular coffee maker, in fact. I just toss the espresso pod, rinse my cup, and screw off the plastic frothing attachment to run some water through it. Ta da! If you don't have time to wait for the unit to preheat, there's another method. Turn on the unit, wait a minute for the green \"ready\" light to come on, and brew some water through it. Wait another minute for the green light to come back on, and repeat a few times. Then put the espresso in and brew. It's a bit faster, but requires you to stand there and work. I have not yet tested the larger basket designed for brewing two glasses. The one drawback I've found is that the basket handle does not want to turn quite all the way, so if I were to use the double basket (which has two nozzles), I would have to set the glasses a bit diagonally from each other to make sure they lined up with the drips. If that's the only problem I can find with this machine, then I'm gonna call it a win. I still go to Starbucks regularly, but not as often. What was costing me $4 to $6 there now costs me about 75 cents. I bought an 18-pack of 18 Lucaffe' Decaf Espresso Pods and an 18-pack of Lavazza Espresso Pods Decaf/Paper, 18--Count so I could drink decaf in the evenings (see my reviews of both), For those of you wanting to buy a tamper instead of using the plastic one that's built in, the Espresso Tamper 50 & 60 Mm Sizes Cast Alloy Hand Coffee fits the basket correctly. I'm really glad I bought this; it had been awhile since I'd been able to buy myself something nice, and this has felt like a real treat after coming off of a long financial slump. I highly recommend buying yourself one; you won't regret it! I do check my account regularly, so I'm happy to answer any questions I can.",

Instead, buy a machine with PID temperature control, double boiler and E61 grouphead and spend roughly $1500+: don't forget the hours of practice and research to learn how to properly brew, too - can't just run into it willy-nilly. However, if you are like me and know you won't be able to afford your \"dream machine\" for some time and are putting away those pennies in the piggy bank to buy the machine (and grinder) of your dreams in a year or two, then by all means, purchase this machine, you won't regret it! There was a little learning curve, I do a small amount of temperature surfing on it and make sure to bleed all the water out of the steam wand before steaming as it can be a little wet. I used to frequent Charbucks regularly - after getting this machine hadn't been there for almost a month and then while out shopping, I bought my usual (latte or machiato). I was amazed at how poorly it tasted compared to mine at home! I hadn't realized the difference because when I started, I was making a sub-standard cup of coffee, but apparently my skill gradually increased without me realizing it: my wife wouldn't even finish hers stating it was \"disgusting\"! Big surprise. She loves Charbucks. Now I'm more determined then ever to continue saving for my \"dream machine\" and continue to hone my skills on this little guy. My only complaint is that all the technique I'm learning to properly steam my milk into a microfoam (it is possible - watch a video made by Seattle Coffee Gear) will need to be re-learned as this has the panarillo wand. But in all fairness, it probably wouldn't generate enough steam for a good microfoam without it. One last note- I love espresso too, but I don't bother making it. Good espresso is an art requiring proper grind and tamp (which are moot points with a pressurized portafilter) and brew temperature (which is admittedly inconsistent - don't read that as a real flaw though, b/c machines costing $700+ have the same temp problem - hence \"temperature surfing\"). So anyway, I often \"test\" the espresso before making my milk-based drinks and sometimes it is quite good; but for the most part I would say make the milk-based drink as it will hide many of the flaws in the espresso and will ultimately produce more consistent and satisfying results. I'm happy with my purchase.",

Other: -If you wish to change your steam wand and are handy, you can exchange it for the silva v1/v2 (can buy it off Ebay) and look up webpages on how to disassemble and modify it yourself. Do this at your own risk, and modifying it can void your warranty, but it has been working awesome on my machine :)",

I don't mind spending \"Big Bucks\" for something I really need and want, but I've got to be able to justify the purchase in my own mind first. I'm the only one in the house who drinks Espresso & Cappuccino now that we're empty nesters, so I'm not going to spend $300-$500 or more for a super deluxe unit. That being said, I'm upgrading from the $39-$49 Steam-Driven DeLonghi to this 15 bar pump model. Boy what I've been missing! I get so much more flavor out of the coffee. If you tamped the coffee on old model just slightly too much, it would take forever to brew with poor results. I tamp this holder to the max with a hand tamper ($5-$6) and the brew is excellent with crema like I've not experienced before except at the expensive coffee shop whose name starts and ends with an \"S\". Those folks familiar with the steam based makers know that it takes forever to foam your milk using the unit, so I have been using an \"Aerolatte\" milk frother available for ~ $20. I heat the milk in a coffee cup in the microwave to ~140-160 degrees F. After a little experience, you learn how long to microwave it without using a thermometer. I then froth the milk \"by hand\", as it were. A real time saver rather than using the built in steamer. Most reviewers of this model say it takes too long, anyway. Always remember \"You get what you pay for\". Expecting the features and performance of a $500 model for $79 or $89 is a pipe dream. However, keeping those couple of tips in mind, this is an exceptional unit when used in a manner similar to mine. As for longevity of the unit..... Only time will tell and I hope to update this review in a few months. Good Luck on your purchases!",

After several months, the machine simply stopped working - it would turn on and it would make steam, but wouldn't make espresso. This very well could have been my fault - I know there were at least one or two times that I left the machine on for several hours which may have ruined the innards, but it definitely didn't stop working after one of those sessions, just out of the blue. I'd argue that this is a design flaw to not have an automatic shutoff but I can't really fault the machine for that as I knew it didn't have that feature before I bought it. That said, I managed to pick up another machine from a \"damaged packaging\" auction on a website and it has worked well for me for two years of infrequent use.",

                "review_text": "I purchased my first Cappuchino and Espresso maker (a Francis Francis) about 13 years ago - when I lived in the UK - and it cost about 12 times the price of the EC155 - it came from Italia and was a bit tempramental but then like all instruments, you have to be taught how to play before you can make great music. When this machine finally died (erm, due to being dropped) I looked around for a cheaper version and I found the De'Longhi EC1. It was their flagship model at the time and cost about 7 times the price of this little baby. That model was also a combined drip coffer maker too. I loved that machine and I loved De'Longhi as a company too for when my machine started to have a leak after about 18 months I contacted De'Longhi who got in touch with a local dealer who repaired it for me free of charge. The only reason I don't have that machine still is that it was one of many 240v kitchen appliances that got left in the UK. So onto this little baby (EC155)- for the price you really can't go wrong. It's small, compact and makes a fabulous espresso and cappuchino - PROVIDING you follow the same simple guidelines that great baristos have been following for generations. 1) make sure you use the right blend of coffee, 2) make sure it's ground to the right level for make espresso, 3) make sure your water has reached the right temp, 4) don't over or under 'temp' (i.e. compact) your grounds and 5) Treat your equipment well - that means cleaning it (the milk frother each time you use it and the machine about once every 90 uses). Do this and this little machine makes a fantastic crema on your espresso. This machine is perfect for making one large cup (double shot) of cappuchino or two esspressos in one go. Reason being, the volume of the coffee ground tray and the height of the machine limits the volume of coffee you can draw from one filling and the depth of the milk jug you can use. But for those occassions when you have 3 or 4 guests around and you want to impress them all with a large latte or cappuchino over dinner... there is an easy rememdy for the milk - just place something underneath the machine to raise it's height. I initially used a non-glossy hardback book. Then I could use a 16oz jug and have all the milk ready for three large cups. I bought this machine about 3 months ago, use it every day (for at least 2-3 large cups for me and my partner) and have not had a problem with it. Which is why I stick with De'Longhi (also purchased two airconditioners and fans from them over the past 10 years). I have read many of the negative comments on here and apart from mechanical faults, the issue found can all be address by the 5 golden rules above - rules that apply to any bar pressure espresso maker - which by the way, also applied to the expensive Francis Francis model I originally owned and almost gave up on until someone taught me the.. do's and don'ts. It's just a shame you can't get the same wide range of De'Longhi machines in the US.",

Now it's started leaking from various places and needs replacing. I descaled it and maintained it, though probably not as often as I should have. But at today's price this machine made espresso at about 3 cents a shot over its life. This was well worth it. I've owned other machines, mostly Gaggias, but the De'Longhi gave me less trouble and makes by far the most consistently good espresso. The filter basket is small, so you really need to use the double-shot basket for a strong single shot. I don't use the milk frother much, since I admit to preferring microwaved milk when I make cafe-con-leche (aka latte). The only reason this did not get a resounding 5 stars is that there's not enough height below the filter to fit a regular coffee mug. For my next machine I've ordered the De'Longhi Bar32, since it's supposed to have a 3.5\" clearance for a larger cup. If it makes espresso as well as this one I'll be very happy.",

Anyways, being brand new to espressos and being the only one in the house that drinks coffee, I opted for this lower cost maker (and the great reviews convinced me). I watched a few You Tube videos which really helped me learn how to make the espresso and foamed milk...I barely had to read the manual when it arrived. I ran 5 brews through to clean the machine and I was ready to go! The first few shots I made either came out too weak or too strong (needed to work on my tampering) but once I figured out the best way to tamper the coffee, I was all set!!! I've been using Illy espresso and steaming 2% organic milk and this is heaven!!! The machine heats up fast and the noise has not woken my children up in the morning...it is easy to use (even for a first timer like me).

                "review_text": "The ONLY reason I thought about giving this 4 stars, as opposed to 5 stars, is because of its pump's short longevity. Otherwise, this makes a great cup of espresso, and when the pump gives out, they replace the machine (if it stops working within the year warranty period - which, sadly, it did with my two purchases, as well as the first replacement - we'll see how long THIS replacement lasts!) And they are very forthcoming with honoring their warranty. This is the second machine of this model I have actually purchased in the past four years - each purchase has been replaced with another machine, and also the first replacement went bad (pump failed and it was not under warranty, obviously - it was a replacement), so I had to purchase a second machine, which just went bad, and which they have just replaced under warranty. So, technically, I have gotten about a year's worth of service out of each of four machines. The first purchased one stopped making enough steam for frothing - I now use a separate frother machine, so I don't care. The first one also leaked. This last purchase stopped pumping properly, strongly enough to make the coffee. You might wonder why I keep using this model, and why I purchased a second one after the first, and its replacement, failed? The price is extremely reasonable, compared to other makers. It is user friendly, easy to care for, easy to clean, and makes terrific creama, every time. The second REPLACEMENT machine also lost power in its pump, so I had to buy a new one. So I have actually bought TWO machines, but used four over the four years, because of the warranty. Maybe that is the best you can hope for the pump mechanism? The price is pretty good, even if you only get a year out of it - consider how much a Starbuck's espresso costs, and then multiply that times 30 for each day you make a great cup, and you begin to see how reasonable this is. I cannot speak highly enough about customer service - it makes the failure of the machine tolerable. I still love this little guy, despite its frailties.",

After a fire caused by my next door neighbor that nearly killed my family, this was one of the few appliance that survived the fiasco of fire, smoke, and water damage. I was hesitant to plug this in and use it in my new place (since my drip coffee machine fried when I gave it a try), but I was desperate for coffee... and HOLY WOW! Not only did this machine work, it continued to press out rich, creamy espresso with near-waterless steam! I can't believe it! Now that I got a forced rhythm into using it, I've been making coffee every morning the past 5 months and it's still going strong! I have absolutely NO complaints about this product! It delivers such great espresso and became easy to use, I avoided purchasing a replacement drip coffee machine. They only problem is, I can't drink regular drip coffee anymore since my standards have been elevated so high by this small 15bar machine!",

The review that was written by someone who is actually from Italy made a big impression on me as I was able to visit there this past year and had the opportunity to drink a REAL cappuccino. Insert Homer Simpson drool here.... This works just fine for me to make cappuccinos and I didn't buy a separate tamper or a burr grinder. I use the blade grinder I've had for years and the plastic tamper dealie that is on the side of the machine. I'm sure the espresso would be even more awesome with a burr grinder, but I get good crema with what I have. I did buy the demi cups and little spoons as that's what they used in Rome and what a good idea! I hate it when you have all that foam in the bottom of the cup and you're smacking it against your lips trying to get it... If something significant happens, I will update my review, but so far SOOO good. I can't stop making cappuccinos!",

                "review_text": "My husband and I had a daily Starbucks habit we were trying to stop considering it was costing us over $2,000 a year at least. I didn't want to spend a lot, and this seemed to be the best reviewed machine in the lower price range. I am very happy with the results from this machine. There is a thick crema and the steam wand creates a creamy foam that I love. I definitely prefer this over Starbucks. The only real negative to me is that the milk steamer wand is so low that I have to use a small 12 oz pitcher. When making espressos for both me and my husband, I have to steam the milk twice to have enough for two lattes. I think that if I set the machine on a platform, I would be able to use a larger pitcher and avoid this problem. I also did a lot of research on the accessories needed for this product so will list them here if anyone is interested - all of them are available on amazon: Bodum Pavina Double-Wall Thermo Glasses (2 oz) - These espresso shot glasses fit perfectly - I know some people have complained that the machine is too low for normal coffee cups or shot glasses. They also keep the espresso warm while you are steaming your milk and don't get hot on the outside so your fingertips don't get burned. Rattleware 12-Ounce Latte Art Milk Frothing Pitcher - small enough to fit under the low steam wand. Lavazza in Blu Espresso Ground Coffee - I barely have time to make myself espresso in the morning, so grinding beans fresh daily was simply not an option. This is a great preground product. Delicous and sweet - I am not into the super bold espresso, so this is perfect for me. RSVP Terry's Tamper - The tamper on the machine is ackward to use, so you will need a separate one. The small end is the perfect size for this machine. I hope this was helpful!",

Espresso is spot on and full bodied, crema and everything. Steam frother is rather awkward but also works well. A little advise is to make sure you have a sort mug on hand or an espresso cup, since there is not much space for a regular mug or cup. I dropped mine from pretty high while moving houses and it is still going strong by the way, so that's a plus. Clean the underside of the dispenser on the machine after use, since some grinds remain in it. A wet towel does well.",

I bought a tamper with it because quite a few people said the built in tamper was inadequate. Well I could have saved myself a few bucks because I would rather use the built in tamper than the tamper I bought! It does the job and is always there. You don't really have to put a lot of pressure to tamp the grounds firmly. I always use the double shot and fill to the top with grounds and tamp firmly. I found the Pilon brand espresso the best for my taste. Makes rich espresso with nice thick creama. This pump machine is way better than the steam operated one it replaced. Now I enjoy espresso the way I like it. I'm not into cappuccino's or latte's so I can't comment on the wand. Never used it. I have been using this machine for at least 3 years, usually I'll just drink one double espresso every morning and that's it. There is a spring loaded valve (behind the screen where the coffee comes out) that I had to adjust several times because somehow it would be in too far and no coffee would come out. I would have to loosen it about 1-1/2 rounds and it would be fine. That is the reason I didn't rate it 5 stars.",

It's easy to use, easy to clean, and most importantly, makes a dark, rich espresso worthy of a coffee house. It took me a few tries to perfect the amount of coffee to use, how fine to grind the beans and how much pressure to apply to tamp the grounds. My advice on the tamping is to not be shy and really pack the grounds if you like strong espressos (as I do). The complaints about not having enough clearance for a \"regular cup\" seem to be silly, as this IS an espresso machine, and you can just dump the shots into a mug if you prefer. With respect to another common complaint, the frothing wand is short, but you can always put the machine on a counter's end and use any size frothing pitcher you want if this design doesn't suit what's in your cupboard. I cheat anyway and microwave my milk for 1.5 minutes and then use a hand frother to foam it up. That saves on having to clean the wand each time, and I'm usually rushing in the morning, but not too much to miss making a latte :-). The amazon warehouse deal was fantastic. I got 50% off because the packing box, and just the box, was dented. The machine itself was in perfect condition, and all parts and directions were included, in unopened packaging. 110% satisfied customer.",

I will say that I was concerned when I realized how thick the dual filter with handle was and that my teacup I used for years did not fit under it. The solution was the 2\" tall \"BIA Cordon Bleu Bistro Espresso Cup and Saucer, Set of 4, White\". I highly recommend you buy these cups with this Espresso Maker. I was impressed that with the exact same beans and water, this machine made a much better cup of espresso. I could never go back to the $60 Hamilton Beach maker now. The only problem was clearance for cup and the cups noted above solved that problem. The pressure system works very well and espresso comes out very quickly and is consistent for about 3oz before it starts to weaken. I'm very happy with this purchase. I've been using it daily for few weeks now. note: I grind my own beans every few days.",

                "review_text": "After owning two Cuisinart Espresso machines(one after the other) and having them both die after about a year's use, I decided to look for another reasonably priced machine. Consumer reports indicated that the DeLonghi EC-155 was a great espresso for the money(budget category). I purchased this earlier this month, received it from Amazon shipping within three days and got it ready to use. After having read many of the reviews of this machine on this website, I watched for potential problems and thus far, have found none. Yes, the plate that the cup rests on vibrates a bit but so did the Cuisinart. It does not affect performance, just keep your eye on the cup(as it fills the vibrating is less). I found warm-up to take only two minutes or so and it is ready to brew. It takes less time to the frothing procedure after brewing. Now to the frothing aspect. The wand may be shorter than the Cuisinart but I do one of these two things and it solves the problem. I have a metal frothing pitcher and I just tip it(I don't fill it to more than 1/4 to 1/3)! Or, I move the machine to the edge of the sink with the wand over the sink space which gives me even more room. Neither is a big deal to prepare a great froth. And, the adjustable steam knob at the top allows me to produce the froth quickly or slowly, but after making two cups of cappuccino, I figured it out! Much better than the Cuisinart froth. Also, I have a separate tamp that I use(I do not use pods) and I always have dry grounds when I dispose of them by just lightly tamping; but that also comes with practice. I have not had any leakage or water coming from anywhere. This is an absolutely great \"little\"(and it is petite!) machine for the money. Who knows how long it will produce but my past experience with Cuisinart is a year. Plus, Cuisinart's answer to customer service on a machine still under warranty is to have YOU ship a 20# machine back to them with trackable packaging and insurance(at your expense). Oh, and you need to include a personal check for $15.00 to allow them to ship another one back to you. Not high on my list of problem solving! My first Cuisinart quit pumping; the second blew the frothing wand right out of the machine(a plastic housing was cracked and broken-but not a replacement part item) into the hot milk. Fortunately, I wasn't burned. a Finally, I am stating that is a great little machine for the money. If you read consumer reports and other reviews on various machines, you'll get the picture!",

The milk frother is a little short and difficult to work with but I don't make cappuccino often. I will use the frothing wand to dispense hot water to make my espresso an Americana and it works well for that. The water reservoir is adequate for 1-2 people for number of double or quad shots. The space saving size is a bonus though it does not come with shot cups/glasses, so think about those if purchasing. I bought a double shot glass to use with it but it was still too tall. The cup that I use now is only 2 5/8\" tall and I still need to tip it just a bit to get out from under without spilling any precious espresso. Use a good quality coffee, grind using the Capresso 560.01 Infinity Burr Grinder, and enjoy your espressos at home for under $200.",

I use coconut milk, and it works fine. I also purchased some illy espresso beans, and I know this is gold standard, but I don't care for them. It doesn't taste like coffee to me. So back to the machine, the housing is plastic, as well as the water reservoir and there is a new plasticky smell, but it's not real bad. If your sensitive to plastic smells take note.

In every single unit that I purchased, it's not long before the seal between the coffee pump and steam wand start to fail and the machine develops a prostate problem. Generally I just put a sponge down on the counter, but eventually the problem gets so bad that the machine gets replaced. I would say this is what kills most of them or the pump just weakens. These machines take a very long time to prime, and suggest you don't let them run out of water. Two of the machines had very weak pumps, and I got nothing more than a dribble instead of a steady stream of coffee. The very first machine I purchased had the best pump of all four, but none have been as good since. That first one I could really tamp the grounds hard, but my latest one I can't tamp the grounds at all or it simply won't pump. I believe this machine is capable of producing a great cup of coffee, but it's not without its problems. The biggest issue is probably quality control between machines. No two machines have been the same. The steam wand has always been outstanding, no problems whatsoever. The biggest issue is the pump and then the seal between the pump and steam wand. I finally purchased a commercial machine as the aggravation factor with these machines has just gotten too much over the years for me. They need TLC to make em' work right. For the price, I don't think a person can complain too much. It's pretty easy to spend $700 or $800 on a good quality machine. I've got these for as little as a $65.

For one it took to long to heat the water. I didn't have to wait around with the Krups and was always told my cappuccinos were better than Starbucks. I ended up with a Mr coffee that was a pump but very inexpensive. It did the job but I wasn't knocked out by it. It broke after not much time but I felt I got my money's worth. I went back to a Krups like my first but I couldn't turn the knobs on this one and I had lost the patience for steaming when the machine was ready, not when I wanted to like with the pump. After a lot of research I came around to this EC155 De longhi. Those of u who hesitate because of the \"design flaws\" should really give this inexpensive machine a chance. It is designed for the espresso to drip into shot cups but if you want a larger cup or carafe, that's easy to get around. I use the same glass caraf I've had for years; I just remove the silver plate and I have the extra headroom. When it comes to the \"short frothing tip\" ... I use a standard stainless frothing pitcher and bring the frothing wand out over the edge of the counter so I can fit it under and have control up and down. My pitcher overflows with froth. I dont see needing more that that and i could always make more. As far as the espresso strength, just use the larger filter and experiment with the grind and type of bean. In truth, most of the negative comments are directed at design preferences not actual flaws. One thing I have noticed in relationship to my previous maker is it doesn't get as hot. It's hot enough...just not as hot.",

                "review_text": "This compact pump-driven espresso maker produces excellent results for the one- or two-cup-a-day customer. If you drink more espresso than that, you should invest in a more expensive and larger machine. I've owned this machine for over a year now (as of April 2009) and it is still working great. I haven't had any problems with it at all, and some of the inconveniences described in some of these reviews can be easily overcome. 1. \"the attached tamper doesn't do a good job\" - it works fine if you take the time, but the pushing up motion isn't as easy as pushing down with a real tamper. Solution: an inexpensive tamper such as the RSVP Little Gem 49mm Espresso Tamper. The portafilter on this machine is 51mm wide but the 49mm size works just fine. 2. \"the space under the dispenser is too small and I can't fit a coffee cup under there\" - this isn't a Mr. Coffee machine, it's an Espresso machine designed for shot glasses, not coffee cups. Buy a couple of inexpensive glasses like the Bodum Pavina 2 oz thermals, they fit perfectly and keep the shots warm while you prepare the milk. 3. \"the frothing wand doesn't work, is too small, is too short, etc.\" - the wand works perfectly if used correctly. Buy an inexpensive stainless steel cup like the Rattleware 12 oz Latte Art Pitcher. Fill it up less than half way, and be sure to hold the nozzle right at the surface to draw air into the milk. As the milk increases in volume, be sure to lower the cup to keep the tip at the surface. When the milk level is about a half inch from overflowing, raise the cup so the nozzle is deep and that will continue warming but not produce any more foam. You'll be able to feel when temperature is right (almost too hot to hold) or you can use a thermometer. You will have perfect microfoam this way. If you have trouble getting the cup out because of the counter top, either put the machine on a platform to raise it an inch, or use it on the end of the counter so the frothing wand is easily accessible. Clean the machine daily by drawing a shot of plain water without the portafilter attached before you turn it off. Always shoot some steam through the frothing wand into an empty cup after steaming the milk to clean it. Wipe it down. Rinse the drainboard, it's easily removeable. Do this and the machine will last a long time. Also clean the portafilter basket daily: the bottom screws off, leaving the basket body, plastic insert, filter disk, and rubber gasket. 5 parts to rinse and let dry, reassembles in seconds. POSTSCRIPT NOVEMBER 2010 - After 2.5 years of flawless operation, this machine has died. The heating element no longer works, when I turn the switch to \"on,\" the green \"ready\" light also comes on immediately, but the water never heats up. Disappointing, but I certainly got my money's worth. I have a call into the DeLonghi service line, but if repairable, the cost is likely to be close to the cost of a new unit. The only question is whether to buy another model or an upgrade....",

                "review_text": "So I had a Starbucks habit that was getting pretty expensive. I tried using the stovetop espresso maker and heated milk, but it's just not the same. I started looking for an espresso maker, thinking I would need to shell out $300 for a decent machine. When I saw the rating and the price for this unit, I thought it was too good to be true. At one point in my life I had been gifted a cheapo machine from a big box store, and it made terrible espresso and also pooped out after a few months. I thought this would be a similar experience, but it's not. I'm by no means an expert in espresso, other than spending a lot of time in Italy and drinking espresso several times a day while there. I really don't know the mechanics that go into making good espresso, but I do know when espresso is good. Anyway, I was able to pull a shot with nice crema and a resulting hard puck of grounds on my first try with this machine. I read the instructions and some tips from these other reviews, and I used Lavazza coffee. I also steamed milk to turn my shot into a latte, and it was so good. I considered bothering my husband at work to tell him all about it. It's true that it's a little difficult to get the basket holder attached/screwed in tightly, but I figure that will change with time. And the wand is a little awkward in terms of proximity to the counter, but so what. It's not insurmountable, and I'm willing to deal with it at this price point.",

                "review_text": "I upgraded to this product after 10+ years of using Mr. Coffee Esspresso Maker ($35) that finally succumbed to hard water deposits. I love how fast the pump machine is in comparison to the steam type machine. I bought a separate tamper since the one on the machine is not very useful and in my kitchen it is up against a microwave and not very easily accessable anyway. It makes great esspresso from my cheap brand of esspresso beans. I do grind them at home and it comes out with a thick layer of crema that tastes great. The steamer arm is rather short so it can be difficult to use with a deep steamer cup. I just use an old measuring cup that I tip sideways so that the steamer tip can reach deep into the milk. The clearance between the bottom plate and the esspresso drip is also quite small so I just remove the plate on the drip tray and my coffee mug fits just fine. So far clean up is easy and I like that it has a water tank with a viewing window so you can see the water level without opening it. I only have to add water every couple of days. There are very few drawbacks to this machine and all can be overcome easily. I love this machine and would highly recommend it to anyone.",

Spring back to the beginning of August, and my wife and I took a nice little two week getaway to Europe, specifically London, Paris, and of course, Amsterdam. While across the pond, I rekindled my love for 'fancy' coffee, where rolling around with espresso didn't make you a ponce, just a normal, upstanding person. While I was still over there, I placed an order for one of these so that upon my arrival home, I could make some decent cups of coffee. I chose this machine, like most of us, for the price - I wanted to make sure this wasn't just puppy love before ordering something more powerful, beautiful, and frankly hipster. Fast forward 3 months, and I still don't see the need to replace the machine. It heats up fast, creates good crema - especially with the Lavazza Gusto, and pulls two shots per puck with ease. It's nothing fancy. You're not going to win any barista awards with this one. It's basically featureless outside the bare minimum, but I like it. It takes up practically no space at my coffee bar, looks decent enough, and just plain works. If you're in the market for an entry level espresso machine, click buy. It's has a great value-to-satisfaction ratio.",

Warning: don't listen to the online articles and videos about making modifications to the machine to improve either the quality of expresso or the form. They don't work or not worth the effort.

                "review_text": "We are exceptionally hard on an espresso machine and this one just keeps on standing up to the tests. Our first machine lasted 2 months through no fault of it's own. Not realizing the importance of good water, we were using our very hard well water and putting, literally, 20-25 shots per day, and sometimes more, through this machine. I decided to clean it and that was a mistake. The deposits broke loose and clogged the machine and the screws were completely cemented in so I couldn't remove them. My bad! Ordered another one, got it in two days (way to go Amazon)and have had it now for over a year and a half and still putting between 10 - 20 shots each and every day through it. I now buy distilled water for this since it's inexpensive and I've not had a single issue with the machine. I must say it rarely gets the cleaning that's recommended, either. As others have noted, the fineness of the grind is directly related to how your espresso comes out. I've used all kinds of coffee beans and have a few personal favorites, but am still using a cheap grinder. Someday I'll see how much a good burr grinder improves the espresso, but it's not a priority for me. I found several small cups at the thrift store (25cents each) that fit perfectly under the spouts, so no need to spend a lot on fancy little cups. I think some of these might be for punch and some are the older style low coffee cups, not mugs that we now commonly use for coffee. Almost all of our coffee is made with 2 or 3 shots, and once you get the hang of it you can do it rather quickly. The frother is really good! Yes, it's a bit low to the counter but it's so simple to let it sit over the edge of the cabinet top or just elevate it with a shelf or cutting board, etc. It froths exceptionally well, and as noted by others there is no need for it to reach to the bottom of your frothing cup or mug, although with most of the mugs I use (most are about 12 ounces) it still reaches nearly to the bottom with a slight tilt to the mug. I make the espresso in the small cups and pour it into the mug that I frothed the milk in. I add sugar to the mug with the milk before frothing and it melts the sugar perfectly. I'm still amazed that this machine at this price just keeps on truckin' after all we keep putting it through. I've never tried the pods as they seem a little pricey to me for such a small added convenience. I toss out my collected coffee grounds on the acid loving plants I have outside the kitchen. Don't be afraid of it. For most people it will do everything you want and for those who are expecting a coffee house commercial machine, well, expect to pay multiple times more. I can see no reason this won't last several more years at even the high level I've been using it.",

Beware using delicate china or thin mugs as the machine does rattle a bit so daintier mugs might fall if left unattended while the espresso is pouring.",

This is the perfect union of speeds. The De'Longhi EC155 brews 2 tiny cups of espresso in less than 1 min. The resulting drink is a dark, hot, rich espresso full of flavor and ready for fast consumption. It comes with filters for a single espresso and a double espresso. I usually make a double espresso each morning, a double after lunch and a double at the end of the day. On busy days, a double double helps me to move fast! This is a small machine and it takes a while to heat the water. If you want lots of espresso, you need to get something larger. If you just need a double espresso a few times a day, this is the perfect machine. The frother works great but you can only use one function at a time. You might want to froth the milk before you make the espresso. When I froth milk (not often) it works very well. 2% milk works best for me. Sometimes I mix in a little half and half as well.",

No. That is because I actually love the Starbucks slightly burnt espresso taste, which some people detest. I think this machine just does not have the temperature or the pressure. But does it make as good an espresso as some other coffee shops like Illy? Hack yeah. This is not a commercial grade machine, meaning if you want to make four or five espressos in a row this just won't do, as the machine starts to \"overheat\" and loses pressure. The milk stirrer is wonderful. It just works. If I have to be picky the one complaint I have is that the machine vibrates so much when it is dispensing espresso that the cup would not stay in place, so you have to hold the cup to keep it in place to catch the coffee. Always use freshly grind beans and tamper it right and you would get good espresso with nice crema.",

                "review_text": "I had been using a SAECO-built unit that Starbux labeled and sold a few years ago -- a big heavy thing that made great espresso. Water reservoir was not well-designed and it some other quirks. But I wanted a more compact unit. This DeLonghi is indeed more compact and makes an espresso that is 95% as good as the bigger machine, when you use ground coffee. With the ESE pods, however, the robustness and complexity of the flavor are diminished (the price of convenience). You put a single pod in the smaller of the two supplied brew baskets and press the button and you have pretty a good single or 1-1/2 espresso in a few seconds. Even better, do all that twice, each one a ristretto, so basically a double ristretto. July 2012 UPDATE: With Illy pods, the branded side goes on top. With Lavazza pods, the dotted side goes on the bottom. Be sure the pod is pressed firmly into the bottom of the brew basket. Also, I have noticed that if you use a finer grind of espresso (I'm talking about ground coffee, not the ESE pod) this DeLonghi may jam and you will only see a slow trickle come out -- this means the espresso is ruined and you need to start over. It can also jam if you tamp it too much (but that can happen with any machine). So try a somewhat coarser grind. I tried the same fine grind in the SAECO/Starbux machine and it worked great. So the DeLonghi has less pressure (despite the bar rating) than a heavier machine -- no surprise. As for pods, I found the Lavazza ESE pods to be better than the Illy. The Illy has some nice chocolatey flavor, but it's weaker. They are both medium-roast and smooth, not like burned Starbux espresso. Both available on Amazon. No mess, no fuss with the pods. The electric control knob is poorly marked, hard to tell where it's pointing and what it's pointing at. The instruction manual is absurdly complex, and apparently written by someone who has a lot of extra time AND doesn't know how to use this model. It tells you to spend 5 minutes running a pump cycle to warm up your cup (yep). Then wait 30-45 MINUTES MORE for the boiler to warm up again (that's what it says!). Actually, you can warm your cup in hot tap water (or not at all), and the boiler warms up very quickly -- you only have to wait till the green light comes on, which takes about a minute, at the most. Run some water through into a spare cup/dish and you're ready to make espresso. The filter holder takes a lot of torque to engage into the machine, maybe that will get easier if it loosens up a bit, or maybe my unit was built incorrectly. But you only need to turn it a few degrees to make a sufficient seal, so not that big a deal. I haven't tried the milk frother -- but my suggestion would be to remove the plastic thingy (it screws down and off), and just use the metal tube end, held just below the surface of cold milk. Easier to do, and easier to clean. So in general, a very good machine, esp. for the price.",

                "review_text": "Reading a good amount of in depth reviews from people who were self proclaimed \"espresso/coffee connoisseurs and watching product demonstration videos on the web, I was persuaded to purchase this item and return the Mr. Coffee espresso machine I was going to originally purchase for my father. I am by no means a connoisseur and occasionally drink cappuccino, and my dad almost exclusively drinks cappuccinos. So between the two of us, could we use this machine to create what we like that would rival that of our local coffee shops? Design The design isn't too bad. the casing is plastic but there are some features such as the boiler and portafilter is stainless steel... it's not exactly sleek like I have seen in the other product of the line, but its not unsightly. It is a small appliance that takes up very little counter space, which is good in our small kitchen. My dad still had enough space for it to be put proudly on display on the counter along with the various accessories we have purchased; it looks like a mini coffee shop in the corner of our kitchen. Prep Time: The machine is fairly to get used to but as some others said there is a bit of work involve. If you are looking for a machine where you just press a button and everything is made for you, this is not the product to buy. By the time you prepare the steamer for the milk, depressurizing and reheating for the espresso, adding the espresso to the portafilter and then pulling the shot, It's roughly 10 minutes. If you are grinding your own beans (I recommend the Mr. Coffee IDS77 Electric Coffee Grinder with Chamber Maid Cleaning System, Black review coming to that shortly as well) then add about another 3-4 minutes to the process. Functionality: The water tank was easily removable so I did not have to worry about filling the pitcher from the appliance but yet take it out to fill it. It probably doe not need to be said but make sure that you are using good water, if it is tap water then at least try to put a filter on it for better a better tasting drink. You can also see the water level when it is sitting inside of the appliance (just make sure you have good light in kitchen to see where the level is at). The steaming wand for frothing milk is low towards the counter surface, and if you are using a milk frothing pitcher that is more than 10 ounces, you are going to have to lift the machine to pull it in and out (unless you want to spill the milk). I strongly recommend that you purchase a stable block for the machine to sit on; not too high, maybe 2-3 inches off the ground if you are going to use a 8 or 12 ounce pitcher. Some have complained that the bulky steaming wand tip attempts to be dummy proof but it gets in the way, but I didn't see a problem with it. I followed careful directions on how to use it and it came out amazing. There is a metal textured surface on top and from what I saw people could put glasses on top to warm it because that is where the boiler is. If you are a klutz like me, don't do it. If you are not, then its pretty stable place. to put things. There is little room for you to put a coffee mug as is with the portafilter being nonadjustable and sitting low on the appliance. Some of said to remove the drip tray from the bottom. If you are inexperienced like we were, it is best to go with thermal espresso shot glasses like anyway that way you can closely watch how much espresso is being pulled and turn it off in time. It may be one more item to rinse out but then you wont have to be bothered with removing the drip tray each time. You can buy them online, but I went to a nationally known import store and picked up two glasses for under $5. There is a tamper on the side. some say that it sucks because you have to tamp up and recommend to purchase a tamper; others say it doesn't really matter because you technically do not have to apply 30lbs of pressure to your coffee because the filters are pressurized. I went on ahead and purchased RSVP Terry's Tamper to get used to the idea of manual tamper in case we upgraded later on down the line, and have been using that to tamp our espresso grounds. The portafilter comes with two filters a single and a double espresso baskets. You can use the pods for single serving or you can free form it with grounded espresso coffee. With this as a single boiler it will take some time going between drinks for you to go back and forth between frothing more milk and making more shots. If it is just you and another person, this appliance would be absolutely perfect for purchase. If you are one of those constant entertainers and need to have your espresso drinks ready immediately and to more than 2 people, this is not the machine to buy. The first time that you put the portafilter into the machine, you may feel as though you did not put it on securely because due to pictures and videos, you did not do a complete 90 degree twist on to the appliance and it is not pointing straight at you; from the forums I have read that is normal and it will take some wear for it to lock directly in front of you at such an angle. don't be like me and almost panic because the seal is tight you are fine; as long as you make sure that it is secure and wont move then you shouldn't worry about a leak from up top. Speaking of leaks, there will be a tad of water leakage at the bottom, but even the manual itself said that it may happen. Maintenance I haven't really had much maintenance outside of cleaning the drip trays and portafilters and that was pretty easy. According to the manual, I still have some time before I have to go through the whole descaling and cleaning process, so I will give an update in a few months when it is time. From what I have read and watched, is ts really putting the cleaning solutions through the water tank and running it a few times (so its not as much work as you would normally do during one run of making an espresso several times in a row. Is It Worth It? Its not a perfect machine, but I think it is a very good one and its affordable. You might need to make adjustments due to the steam wand, and use espresso glasses to avoid getting frustrated because none of the cups in your cabinet will fit under the nozzle :). You will also need to not mind working a little for your cup, but that in itself may be something that you enjoy like my dad and I did. During Christmas, my dad and I spent all morning using it like we were barista's; used samples from our coffee shop and enjoyed the process that we had to go through to get our \"perfect cups of cappuccinos\". We taste tests and made various hot drinks such as cappuccinos, lattes, hot chocolate (steamed milk). It took a pretty good beating since we used about 10 times on Christmas. Shockingly, everything came out great, but not everyone may experience that on their attempts, but its not the products fault :) that could be anywhere from the coffee bean itself to the human factor that never fails to creep up on us when we aren't paying attention to recipe instructions. So in the end did we rival the local shops by making it at home? Yes! Absolutely.",

                "review_text": "This is my 3rd cappuccino machine and by far the best. The espresso comes out great and it froths really well. It's a little noisier than my others but I think it's because this is a pump machine. I'm giving it 4 stars simply because of design. It is very compact, which is good, but unless you are using a short frothing cup and espresso cups it can be hard to work with because the frother is very low to the counter and there's not much space under the dripper. For me it works out fine because I have a seperate coffee counter in my kitchen. I keep it on the end of the counter top so the frother hangs over the side and I froth the milk in my large 'to go' coffee cup and just spill the espresso in once it's done. It turns out to be a plus for me but I can see why others have complained about it. Really all they had to do was place the frother higher up on the machine and it would be practically perfect. I also place a paper towel under the espresso cups for traction. The pump action makes it vibrate a little and the cup slides to the side...not a big deal plus it keeps the drip pan clean. For $83 you can't go wrong. My cappuccino comes out better than Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks and with the amount of cappuccino we drink this machine paid for itself in 2 weeks.",

Any ground coffee that comes from Puerto Rico is perfect for the machine. Today you can find that type of coffee in many state markets. To know how your end product should taste, when you travel savor an expresso in Spain, Italy, Miami, Cuba or Puerto Rico... Do not use the tamper attached to the machine, its worthless; buy one made of aluminum. If you have issues with your hands or arm you will not be able to apply the necessary pressure upon the coffee grounds. It consistently takes me less than seven minutes to make a cup of expresso from scratch. Have had no problems with the water tank. The clearance between the spigots and the tray to put the cup is small, so you have to use a low and wide cup and be a little careful. It is a basic and small machine so you must cultivate a bond with it so that you get the best result every time. Will buy it again without any reserve.",

For the price it is an awesome deal, He got this for $80 and since we had prime we were able to overnight this for $8, which was worth it. I didn't give it five stars because it will take some time for you to figure out how to get the espresso perfect. After a few days of practice I figured out the machine. With higher end espresso machines, you want the grind to be powder fine. With this machine you want the grind be just a little finer than you would use for coffee. You don't want to tamp too hard either. The grind is the most important part to make good espresso, and I have made some awesome espresso with this inexpensive machine. Yes it is more time consuming than coffee, but you will find that with espresso machines in general. If you're espresso is dripping out too slow (like a drop at a time) then your grind is too fine, or you may be tamping too hard. If you are having trouble, don't give up, just play around with it a little bit and you will be able to get it right. Highly recommend",

Coupled with Illy Medium Roast Beans, this is quite frankly the best espresso I have ever had, and I can enjoy it any time I want in the comfort of my own home. The machine is very affordable to boot and will pay for itself vs any of the Pod based espresso machines or buying at local coffee shops. Pros: -Incredible tasting espresso from an overall simple machine -Warm up and brew times are relatively fast. While it says to wait 20min to brew, I haven't noticed a difference in temperature from when the green light turns on a few min after powering on vs waiting 20min later. In all transparency, I don't need my espresso to be scalding hot either, but like I mentioned, I haven't seen any difference in the brew quality or temperature -Machine is very affordable -Built in steam want makes very good froth when used properly -Water reservoir is a good size and doesn't need to be filled too often Cons: -Shape and location of steam wand are a little awkward, but still very usable. Just not ideal. -Unless you really tighten the knob for the steam want, it can drip water. -Steam wand has some parts that are tough to clean -Machine is fully manual. So you need to be ready to tamp the espresso yourself, and I recommend a hand held tamper vs the built in plastic tamp. This means you'll need to spend a couple of min every moment making your espresso vs a much more expensive, fully automatic machine that makes your expresso at the push of a button -Tightening the espresso cup requires holding the machine in place -Your cup may move due to vibrations int eh machine. I use a rubber pad to ensure it doesn't move -It's best to keep the the grounds cup and filter clean daily. Total time from machine on to clean up can be 5-8min depending on how fast you are.",

The milk steamer is even better than the previous model, even though it is not designed as well; it is spring-loaded so that when you swing it out to heat the milk, it springs back under the machine. The water and steam both heat up quickly. The only disadvantage of this machine, as others have noted, is that it has a low slung spout under which nothing fits, but see my review for a 3-once metal pitcher (BC-3 stainless steel from Update International on Amazon). It's perfect. BTW, I found out the hard way that you should not use fine china espresso cups underneath the spout; eventually, they will crack, even though this one vibrates less than the previous model. This model is great for New York City kitchens where there is virtually no space for appliances.",

While it does its job of steaming milk, it's a bit cumbersome to use and clean and because of the shape and small length it's difficult to find a pot that fits perfectly so I end up having to hold the milk jug or risk spillage. After six months of heavy use the water pump at the top appears to have a leak after making coffee and it drips for a few minutes after brewing. It still functions but it makes a bit of a mess. I'll have to find the manual and see if I just need to replace a washer or something. All in all - it's saved me a ton of money in Starbucks and it still makes great espresso and latte. This was my first espresso maker and it was a great introductory machine. Next time I'm probably going for one that is more expensive now I know what features are important to me.",

The espresso isn't quite as strong as a coffee stands', but its better than our aero press and french press.

The only down side is a bit of ergonomics in the coffee filter: In most other espresso machines, the filter fits tightly in the holder, so disposing of the used coffee is as easy as a couple of whacks.

One important lesson learned: when using milk steaming function, always purge the steam tubes into an empty container after heating the machine to the steam setting and before steaming milk. The first thing out of the steamer will be a bunch of hot water that you don't want to inject into your milk. I also wish this had a little more space for a taller cup under the filter so I could brew directly into a larger cup for latte/cappuccino. As it is, I make the espresso into a small measuring cup and then pour it into a larger mug.",

Leakage, for instance, if you did not attach the portafilters just so. There is zero leakage with this machine. Notice that I used the plural regarding portafilters. Most machines come with two portafilters (the black ice cream scoop-like thing) and this comes with one, and it has two spouts for the espresso to come out of. Well, in my house it's one pod per person unless they really need to be amped. The two outflow holes are obviously for two containers to catch the brewed espresso. If you do espresso shots, this can be a problem, so you'll need a wider espresso cup than the standard shot cup to accommodate it. There are instead two inserts for the portafilter, one for ground espresso, one for pods. The Krups was better made than this machine, but cost three times as much. I've not tried ground espresso, but if you like pods, this is a great machine. You get 15 atmospheres of pressure, and you don't have to wait long for your fix. Sweet! It is easy to clean.",

I believe the fundamental difference is drip vs. espresso so I was looking for a good but inexpensive espresso machine. Read up a bit, read a few reviews of various machines, and eventually settled on this one. I'm not an experienced espresso maker, I hardly know what I'm doing, but I find this pretty easy to use and I'm able to make a coffee that is like what I got in Europe, so I'm happy. No complaints so far, but a word of note to others like me, it took me 4 or 5 tries to become comfortable with making espresso. It's not difficult to use but being new to me, I wasn't sure in the beginning of even the basic steps. Do be sure to read up on the other plentiful reviews of this product. One general thing to note is that this machine is small. And for guidance on using it, there are several Youtube videos of this product. Pros: > perfect size for me and my kitchen space > makes a good cup of espresso Cons: > small size makes it difficult to get the arm on tight > small size can be a problem if all you have are big cups",

Here is what happens: at first, it might be an air lock inside machine. I did as advised - heat up the machine and turn the knob on espresso/hot water. If no hot water comes, turn it back on just heat, wait several minutes and turn on espresso. Repeat several times. On the fourth or fifth time, the air lock was broken and hot water started coming. No more problems. One note on shortcomings - it is a little noisy as it makes espresso, so I had to put it on a foam pad. Also, it vibrates a little as it dispenses espresso and a cup 'walks' around, I put a folded paper towel or a paper napkin under the cup to prevent it.

The directions don't teach techniques well, so I recommend searching You Tube for a video with a similar machine (like the Saeco/Starbucks Barista machine). Most importantly, for those folks, steam your milk FIRST, then make the espresso. AND clean the steam wand after EVERY use making sure to blow out some steam to get any milk residue out of the wand! Milk is VERY sugary and gets sticky and crusty very quickly. I bought this machine to replace my DeLonghi Rialto Super Automatic that stopped working after 6 years. I have been very pleased with this machine so far -- and I've already put it thru it's paces. LOVE: - How fast it heats up - That it's so light and portable and takes little counter space - Has great steam pressure for efficient frothing - Easy to use & clean DON'T LOVE - The base is so light that it moves and can tip when attaching/removing the espresso basket. - The espresso basket on my unit doesn't seem to swivel all the way for brewing, but this does NOT affect the machine at all - just different from my past machines. As you can see, neither of these are deal breakers. For the money, I think this is a great little appliance!",

I have maintained it as instructed, cleaning out with vinegar every 2 months or so. This is an unacceptable life for any kind of commercial product. I liked the great espresso, with good crema. It easily makes frothed milk, and the steamer is very easy to clean (just wipe it and let steam for half a second). It has height limitations for cups but espresso cups and shorter cups all fit fine. If you can accept that this thing will last about year, go ahead. If not take my advice, don't buy one. Build quality has to be suspect (cheap materials in the pump construction?). -- Update 6 months later -- It's working again. I didn't throw it out. I paid more attention to the coffee grind. If the coffee is too fine, the filter blocks up. Maybe a more powerful pump would handle it. Use the grinder at the store and set it it at espresso grade, or pay careful attention to how long you zap it in your grinder. I still love the coffee it makes, its adaptability to pods and ground coffee and its good milk frothing. I do now use highly purified water (reverse osmosis) and haven't need to descale it yet. I hope it lasts longer!",

                "review_text": "I used a DeLonghi Cafe Parme steam-driven espresso maker for about 8 years. My budget was under $100, and I feel this purchase was money well spent. After trying the boiler system, I'll never go back to a steam system. I understand that more expensive machines are probably nicer and deliver even better espresso, but I'm perfectly satisfied with this machine. I don't think the warm-up time is excessive. Honestly, I just turn it on when I come downstairs in the morning. I have two dogs, so I send them out and feed them. By the time I'm done with that, at least 10 minutes has past and I go ahead and make my espresso. I do wish there was more clearance so that you could pull the shots directly into a mug. I did as someone else suggested and removed the metal tray and put a small mug down into the base. I don't have any issues with the amount of clearance for the steam wand. My experience has been that the machine does an excellent job pulling shots, and does an awesome job frothing/steaming milk. Here's my routine. Turn the machine on to warm up for about 10 minutes. During this time I get the ground espresso and filter ready, and put milk in my metal container and put it in the fridge. I put a small mug under the filter and pull my shots. I have another, larger mug ready so that I immediately pour out my shots and put the small mug back under the filter--it continues to drip a bit and I don't want the espresso to be watered down. Then I switch over to the steam function and take the metal container with milk out of the fridge. When the indicator lights goes back on I froth and steam my milk. Easy-peasy. I'm perfectly happy with my purchase and highly recommend the machine. Like I said, more expensive machines may be better, but for the <$100 price, this is excellent! UPDATE (1/27/13): Still using this machine. Still works great! Just needs occasional cleaning. UPDATE (11/15/14): Yep. Still using the same machine! I just use filtered water and clean it when it starts to slow down. Wow, have I gotten my money's worth out of this purchase! UPDATE (4/23/15): I FINALLY had to replace this machine. It finally conked out on me. I ended up buying the same make/model, because the first one was so good to me! :)",

                "review_text": "I wasnt sure what to expect as I thought this would be just a little bit better quality than the typical smaller inexpensive espresso units,But I was so pleased with this De'Longhi 15 BAR Pump!! It heats up very quickly and the pressure of the pump makes me the perfect double shot with nice crema... I also feel the unit is very easy to use and clean. The frothing wand is great quality, it does exactly what it is supposed to do, I think probally just as well as the professional units do in Batista cafes. I havent had any issues with it at all and I use it at least 3 - 4 times a day (some days 2 of the uses is just for kids steamers) I figured that when I saved up more money I would get a bigger nicer De'Longhi and this was just a temp unit. But I am so pleased with it I will be keeping it and there is no need to upgrade. This is a GREAT PRODUCT ESP FOR THE PRICE!! At first I thought that the Porta Filter handle was very hard to slid in and out, But over several uses it got much easier, not looser but it just needed \"breaking in\"... Some complaints were it was too short & some had to put this unit on a book or something, I haven't found that to be a problem, I have a 20 oz frothing pitcher(just a lil over 1/4 full of milk) and I am able to tilt it under the unit just fine with out having to lift the machine. I am a AVID espresso drinker,and I feel I know a good shot of espresso, and with the proper beans and ground size and texture and tamp, You will feel like your at a real barista stand when your making and tasting your espresso! Im so pleased!!",

I did a LOT of research on a replacement machine. I noticed that there were negative reviews on everything from $30 on up to $3,000. I'm thinking \"There's no way I'm spending $3,000 on a machine I may not be happy with!\" Actually, there's no way I'm spending $3,000 on a coffee machine, PERIOD. My wife's a coffee snob though and has friends that have and so she was more willing than I. I found this one and noticed the high ratio of satisfied to unsatisfied customers and pled my case that if we didn't like it, at least we hadn't committed a whole lot of $$$ and then we could try the \"you-get-what-you-pay-for route\". I must admit I read all the reviews and tips on how to make the best cup of coffee using this machine and it paid off - my wife says I made her the best cup of coffee she had ever had using this, the Hario mini mill, Terry's tamper, and some African beans another connoisseur friend of hers gave her for Christmas. We've been using it for 8 months and the only negative is that the steamer sometimes drips a bit - but we haven't cleaned it once since we got it, so maybe it time for a bit of maintenance!",

At the time I was looking for the highest rated, cheapest pump espresso machine I could find and haven't been disappointed. That said, it is definitely an entry level machine and I'm planning on upgrading sometime soon. Pros: + good value + makes good foam and heats quickly + simple to setup and use (it was my first machine ever and was incredibly easy to get started using) Cons: - loud (especially at startup) and rattles - low quality finished -- the metal scratches easily and the labels quickly rubbed off - \"ready\" light doesn't accurately reflect heating - the built in tamper is located in an awkward location and is difficult to clean - espresso production / dripping has worsened over time (much slower and more watery, even after several cleaning attempts)",

                "review_text": "I love this machine. So I give it five stars even though there are some minor (in my mind) problems with the attachments. First, it makes awesome espresso and cappuccino. I only use 100% arabica coffee, that is important in my opinion. Some people who do not like the machine appear to need the usual giant coffee cups for their espresso, but that really has nothing to do with espresso. A 20oz mug full of filter coffee will definitely have more caffeine than an espresso, but I cannot drink that **))$#% bitter stuff. You have to wait some times, until the machine is properly hot. A hissing sound will tell you when. I always fill in espresso roast directly. There is a size limit on the cups that you can use. My spiffy espresso cups are a little over 2 inches tall, my cappuccino cup measures 2.5 inches in height. But in worst case the bottom can be removed, I guess, to fit a bigger cup, I just don't see the point in that. I use the smaller coffee holder for espresso and the bigger one for cappuccino. The cappuccino will therefore obviously contain more caffeine then the espresso, although the cup also holds much more liquid. Everyone will probably have to test him/herself how much coffee to use. Even with the holder full of coffee, it will eventually only let a water-like substance through, after the coffee has been used up, so bigger cups do not make much sense anyway. Espresso/cappuccino are incredibly good imho and plenty strong for me with lots of crema. I recommend not to use the tamping attachment. It attracts coffee grinds on the top surface and is impossible to clean as is cannot be swiveled or moved away otherwise from its position. The plastic measuring cup will do just fine. The frothing wand is too close to the ground and too short to be of much use. I bought a 7$ electric frothing wand that works wonders for my cappuccinos, and I use very little milk with it. The steam-driven wand adds some water to the milk, hence producing a slightly different froth consistency and warms up the milk. It can be combined with the cheap frothing device, but I would not recommend it. The much-ciritcized watery consistency of the leftover coffee comes from filling the holder to the top with coffee grinds. If you use less coffee and tamp it down nicely, it is not watery at all, but that all depends on the extent of your caffeine addiction, I guess. Anyway, it has some slight issues, but is is the right machine for me. All visitors love the espressos/cappuccinos they get from it.",

                "review_text": "Seriously! This unit exceeded my wildest expectations! Just read the instructions and you're ready to dump the expensive coffee shops! The only thing you'll miss is the free wi-fi and the cranberry-lemon-poppy-granola bars! To make a PERFECT cappuccino also consider getting the \" Stainless Steel 10oz. Steaming & Frothing Pitcher \", the \" RSVP Terry's Tamper \" and the \" Bodum Pavina 2-1/2-Ounce Double-Wall Espresso/Shot Thermo Glasses, Set of 2 \" right here on Amazon. For around $100 this combo makes a cappuccino that is JUST as good as any coffee shop I've patronized! Lastly, be sure to get coffee especially fine-ground for espressos... don't just get an \"espresso blend\" for drip coffee makers! You can get \" Cafe Bustelo Coffee Espresso, 10-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4) \" brand here on Amazon (look at its great reviews) or just about any big discount store and it makes a perfect crema and is delicious. Look for a yellow can. Set aside an empty 11-12 oz coffee cup and pull an espresso that just fills the 2.5 oz Bodum Pavina glass (the crema should drag across the bottom of the spouts on the espresso maker. Set the glass of espresso aside and fill the frothing pitcher with COLD milk. We successfully use plain almond milk or 2% cow milk. >>Be sure to only fill to just under the indentation in the middle of the pitcher.<< Use the steamer wand to froth the milk following the instructions that come with the EC155. The milk *should* froth up to just nearly overflowing, making just the right amount of froth. If you use coffee flavorings (like Torani Brand syrups) put them in the coffee cup first (2-3 teaspoons is what we like)... then pour on the froth... then pour your coffee on top. (Be careful... the wide and thick Bodum Pavina cup is a little hard to pour from without espresso dribbling down the side.) Give a very slight stir with a spoon and serve. If you like a very hot cappuccino just microwave for 20-30 seconds and then serve. Anyway, this machine seems to be very high quality for the price and if handled and cleaned carefully after each use, should make great drinks for a long time! There are only a couple of things I would state as \"cons\" concerning this machine. The first is about using the TWO CUP FILTER. In my use, it seemed to produce an inferior cup of espresso compared to the ONE CUP FILTER. The second \"con\" would the tip on the steamer/frother wand. The steam sputters out around the threads and splatters around a bit. And the plastic tip is pretty hard to clean because it has deep areas that are hard to get to. We use a toothpick while running under hot water. I read a blog somewhere that tells how to replace the tip with a simple hardware store domed nut. (Google it.) I'll probably do this mod soon. Lastly, with espresso, be sure to replace the coffee for EACH PULL! Being cheap to the point of re-using used coffee will REALLY disappoint you! Pull one shot, dump the grounds, refill, and repeat! As stated the items above are a PERFECT Espresso/Cappuccino-making combo that we put together after much research. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!",

Expect to get a couple years out of it and then the motor won't have enough power to keep pulling the shots. Learn it's flaws early and you can work around them. Don't expect to get anything out of the first pull or if you do, expect 1/8th to 1/4th shot, don't change out the grains and when the light comes back on, then pull your shot, i find this makes it work just fine and fast. I sometimes use it to make an americano by pulling a couple shots through the same grains. I almost never use my regular coffee maker unless I have guests over. Look at the complaints on the $1,000 makers and above! why spend a ton of money on something that has an equal chance of being a lemon when you can have this for under $100 and buy 10 of them over 20 years and always have a new one you don't feel trapped with that makes a great cup of espresso.",

                "review_text": "I purchased this after researching as many machines as I could, reading many of the reviews/comments/complaints, and decided this would be a best purchase of my first espresso machine. I like espresso, it's just gone to soon after you make it, even if you savor the flavor and stretch it out as long as you can. So I also make mugs of strong coffee so I can sit and enjoy. This machine makes both great. The flavor and strength of my first espresso was far better then any I ever had at a *bucks. I had to experiment with the grind and tamping because I too was getting watery pucks at first. Like another reviewer, I found it's all in the grind and the tamp pressure. I have a capresso burr grinder with 8 settings in the fine to extra fine range. I tried all of them. To fine and it would not make coffee, less fine and would have great coffee but a watery puck. less fine yet and the proper tamp pressure, and it was perfect. Of my fine settings it was about in the middle. BUT, it was also in the tamp...Until I got the Terry's tamper, I couldn't get it tamped firm enough to use the fineest grind that I wanted. Now I have the proper grind marked on my grinder, fill the double filter with two scoops, tap it to settle it, tamp it, refill to the rim, tamp etc. until full. Put it on the machine, brew for 15-25 seconds and its done. Rich, strong espresso, wonderful aromatic crema, dry solid puck. Now if I want coffee, I just brew a double and a single, put it in a mug, add hot water to the top, and enjoy a creamy, flavorful, aromatic coffee with no bitterness or acidity, almost as thick as chocolate milk. To speed things up if I have guests, or if I want several cups, I ordered three more filters from partstore.com for 12 bucks each. I pre fill them and can make four double shots in a row. Also, the frother makes works great. Just learn how to do it on line first. Just under the surface and raise it up as the volume increases. And I use whole milk, which is harder to froth but tastes great.",

I was worried a small version like this couldn't create enough steam for good foam or brew a nice cup of espresso. After a month, this machine has exceeded my expectations. It is a great machine for the price. I have a stainless steel carafe for foaming milk. If you hold the wand just below the surface of the milk, you get perfect foam. My only complaint is that after foaming the milk, I have to tip the machine slightly to pull out the carafe, otherwise I will spill the foam. But this is a minor complaint and could probably be avoided by not creating so much foam but I like my cappuccino foamy. Definitely recommend this machine.",

                "review_text": "I received this yesterday - after spending about a week looking at specs and reading reviews on several different espresso makers that were in my budget. I kept coming back to the De'Longhi, read and re-read many reviews. There were a few repetitive complaints I will list & subsequently add my feedback to the end: 1) can't fit a big enough cup under it - well, it IS an expresso machine and true to typical size of an espresso cup, i don't see the problem. I have coffee shop style (read: small) cups from Williams Sonoma that I use - there is a tad of a clearance problem, maybe a millimeter - but what I did was brew a double shot, making the cup full, then dump it into a larger cup and add my frothed milk, etc. maybe an extra step but no bother to me personally. 2) the machine rattles so much the cup almost jumped off the rack - i did not experience this problem at all! I think that was a bit of a stretch, but whatever. 3) the steamer wand isn't long enough/not right size - again, no problems here. and i didn't buy a specific metal pitcher - a pyrex glass 1 cup measure did the job for me perfectly. 4) preheating the machine - it says 15 minutes - my \"ok\" light comes on prior to that, but either way, 15 minutes is gone a flash in my mornings, so this too, was not a big deal. 5) the filter has sloppy/soggy grounds after a cup of espresso is brewed - maybe these people are popping it off right way or something... i finished my java and when I took my off, had no problems here either. All in all, for the price, the compact size, the quality of the name, the ease of use and the fabulous espresso that it brews - with a very rich, dark carmel colored crema - I totally give this little gem a thumbs up all the way. I even found a $20 rebate coupon online running now thru early December - so for a total cost of under $60 in the end - it's a deal! More of the 5 stars are accurate than the 1's by a long shot - take a chance on it - Amazons return policy is amazing anyway, so what do you have to lose?",

It takes a few (3-4) tries before you figure out how much pressure it takes to tamp it down. I also recommend purchasing a separate tamper, since the one attached to the machine is difficult to use. It's plastic, the machine is lightweight and it's hard to put enough upward pressure on the grounds. I'm reliably getting a decent crema on my espresso. The machine is short, so it easily fits on my countertop with room to spare and refill the water without moving it, however that means there is not much clearance for the cup or the frothing container of milk. It won't take a cup much taller than a demitasse cup. The frothing arm spits out a lot of hot water before a good blast of steam, which waters down the milk. When I first turn it on, I use an empty cup to catch the hot water, turn off the steam, then switch to the milk. Heating up the cappuccino cup first is a good idea anyway. For under $100, I'm really happy with machine so far.",

My current machine is going on 9 months and has made close to 300 double shots of espresso at this point (saving me quite a bit of money in the long run as opposed to buying my drinks at a coffee shop). The design of the steam wand leaves alot to be desired, but I knew that when I bought it (I use another machine for steaming). The construction is ok - lots of plastic, but it doesn't seem overly brittle. No, it's not fancy but it does have a real pressure pump and can make some pretty darn good shots. For the price it isn't bad - but I wouldn't be happy if it didn't last at least 150-200 shots (and pay for itself in the process by saving money over coffee shops).",

Other than this, it lasted 2.5 years with daily use of 4-5 cups a day without any problems and it was refurbished to begin with.

I usually stop it and re-start it when it comes back on - which is always less than a minute. You really should not fill a small espresso cup more than 1/3 full to get full bodied coffee(not the really small ones). I need 3 shots to make my 16 oz iced mocha. Takes time but it does a decent job making espresso. I recommend it unless you can afford to spend $300 or more which will definitely do a better job. The water container is easy to use and keep clean. It has to filter baskets that you can pre-fill with espresso. It does what is expected of it. Nothing more nothing less. I have had expensive ones in the past but for now this works great. I would buy it again. Easy to clean as well. I use only ILLY espresso fine ground. I love Italian espresso.",

Buy yourself a nice expresso or ground roast ... and save $4.00 everytime you make a cup ... after 20 some cups this machine will pay for itself. The money you will be saving everyday going to Starbucks will compensate for high gas prices at the pump ;) Absolutely love this unit here ... perfect cup every single time. I have added a photo collage on how to make a cappucino Caio ! ======= So its been over 10 months since I purchased this expresso maker ===== With over 550 cups made including for my friends, guest and family I must say this is one heck of a machine, I was not expecting this machine to last me this long. In my mind I had that as long as I get 200 cups out of it I got my money's worth. So far I have cleaned this unit throughly with vinegar 3 times and there are no complaints. For most part I am using Lavazza Crema Gusto coffee ($3.49 on sale), filtered water and I use Deans Half and Half for cream. Excellent froth and crema every single time. I ususally steam clean the stainless steel pod after using .. helps maintain the equipment. Once you purchase this unit you will notice that your social life will improve, friends will stop often for a cup of coffee :) and for less than $0.35 cents a cup its the cheapest way to entertain your friends. ============ Over 3 years Now and still cranking cup after cup ========== I must say I am impressed ... with over 2400+ cups of cappuccinos made and served to many family and friends I must say that I have gotten every single penny worth from this unit and then some.

Still going strong, and my lattes like or better than what I can order at Starbucks. Here's my poor man's espresso set up, I paid a total of $120 $20 Coffee grinder: KRUPS 203-42 Electric Spice and Coffee Grinder with Stainless Steel?blades,?Black $80 Espresso maker: THIS De'Longhi EC155 $15 12oz Milk frothing cup: KRUPS XS5012 12 Ounce Stainless Steel Milk Frothing Pitcher,?Silver $5 5oz Espresso cup: Update International BC-5 Stainless Steel Bell Creamer, 5-Ounce, 2-3/8-Inch This month I was concerned with the espresso maker. It was only dripping (or sometimes not at all) and a 2.5oz shot would take 60 seconds! I tried to clean and unclog the porta-filters. I removed and cleaned the filter by the boiler. I even twice tried to descale the machine using a 1:1 distilled vinegar and water solution, making sure I give it 15 minutes before flushing out the solution. Even after spending a couple of hours doing this, the machine refused to cooperate. Finally, I sucked it up and went to bed-bath-beyond and bought a brand-name descaler Durgol Swiss Espresso Special Decalcifier, 2-Pack 4.2 fluid ounce Bottles . The instructions were to dump the 4.2oz with 4.2oz water in the tank and run that through the machine. I was quite pessimistic initially! However, this actually worked! I had to flush 4-5 tanks of water through the machine to completely flush the solution out. I'm now writing this review after pulling a perfectly timed 25-second shot on my newly restored EC155. I remember when I initially bought the machine that it was quite loud, and I was happy that with use the thing quieted down a bit with use. However, I noticed that after descaling the machine is now as loud as it was new! Bummer! So... I guarantee this machine will stop working if not maintained properly. I'm amazed that the thing kept working for 8 months without any maintenance. I wholeheartedly recommend the durgol descaler to restore your EC155 to full working order!",

The customer support is great. They will give you a new replacement if you mail in the electrical cord of the broken unit. I\u2019ve noticed that the machine struggles a lot if you use very oily beans- the pump seems to have a very hard time forcing enough pressure through and one pull would take up to a minute. If you use nonoily beans, there is no problem. Also, the espresso machine should work while using a very fine grind and tamping with 30 lbs of pressure. If you try doing that with this machine, the espresso won\u2019t come out or it will take 1-1:30 minutes for a double shot. To sum up, I think it is a great introductory machine, but I will probably upgrade to something better once my current machine dies again.",

                "review_text": "I bought this machine in September of 2012. As of today, 3/21/2013, it's still running just fine. I have deep cleaned it maybe 3 times and use it at least 3-6 times a week. I always use filtered water. I am very anal about the cleanliness of my espresso and coffee products in general. I'm the guy who spends more time cleaning the machine after use then actually enjoying my coffee :) I'm only going to touch on the negative aspects of the machine since you can read MANY other reviews that highlight the positive. My biggest complaint is with the portafilter. It's mostly plastic and the metal piece is a cheap quality metal. Mine use to be a shiny chrome finish and now it is a dull grayish color and doesn't slide into the locking mechanism as fluidly as it use to. The piece that pops out of the portafilter I will call the basket. There is a single shot size and double shot size. Who actually uses single shot basket? lol. The basket consists of 4 parts that unscrew for cleaning. Only problem is, you don't know how tight to tighten the piece when putting it back together. If you torque it down to much it will slow down the flow of espresso leading you to think your grind is too fine or your tamp pressure is too much, when the problem is the basket gasket screw tightness. If you leave it too loose, it may let the espresso flow out too fast. I usually just tighten this a little bit past the \"numb\" once it starts to give some resistance. Last thing about the portafilter is after a few washings, you will start to notice water creeps in between the two piece, plastic handle. It's held together by three screws, so every now and then you might want to take it apart and clean out all the coffee grime that has accumulated in there. From day one I didn't like how the portafilter felt, but it will pull a decent shot of espresso is everything is right. (grind, tamp, ect.) The only other negative aspect of the machine is the small space between the portafilter drip nozzles and the base where you lay your espresso cup. It's very small and it's hard to find proper size shot glass to fit underneath. I, 95% of the time take the metal base piece off to give me that extra inch or so of clearance. This defeats the purpose of the drip catcher altogether but it's not too bad if you lay down a piece of folded paper towel or rag and place your shot glass on top. This keeps your glass from rattling too...tricky tricky. Everything else works great. It heats up well and gets hotter as you use it. The steam wand works good at this price point. I usually steam up at the most, 4-6 ounces of milk or cream when making a latte or cappuccino. I use an insta-thermometer and it takes less then 1 minute to get to 160-185 degrees. I like to steam it on the hotter side because I always make a quad shot and it takes a little time to clean out the portafilter and shot glass between shots. I use to use the Hario Mini Mill Slim hand grinder and just recently acquired the Breville Smart Grinder. The Hario slim works well with this machine on the 4th click out from full tight. I'm still getting use to the Smart Grinder but it works well somewhere in the middle of the espresso grind settings with this machine. Make sure you buy your own 50 mm tamper as the one on the machine isn't ideal. Keep it clean and use fresh, filtered water and I'm sure this machine will last you until you feel you are ready to upgrade to a better machine. That's what I'm about to do, but I will keep this machine in the pantry for a back up or maybe give it to a friend who wants to learn to make good espresso. If anyone has a recommendation of my next espresso machine I would love to hear it. Please write a comment. Thanks and happy coffee drinking.",

                "review_text": "Makes decent espresso and is very easy to use. Quick points on how I've gotten this mini maker to do what I'd like: Steaming milk: - For the steam wand, you can produce microfoamed milk for latte art by cutting off the skirt portion of the frother. If you know how to steam milk, you can still make the extra foam for cappuccinos. - You can also get into the machine and replace the wand, but you also void your warranty. - You can get a smaller/shorter frothing pitcher, or move the whole machine to the edge of the counter, so your pitcher doesn't run into the counter. Espresso: - My espresso was hit-or-miss with crema, until I fine tuned my grinder to something more powdery. The \"espresso-grind\" setting at the local store is NOT fine enough! - You can also experiment with different espresso baskets. The only real downside is that the water doesn't stay constant enough sometimes, and the \"Red light\" will turn on while in mid-espresso extraction, as well as steaming. Temperature fluctuation are not good, but unless you're particular about your espresso, it still tastes great.",

But 16 months later, I am sad to report it has died. If I had paid $400 and it lasted only 16 months I would NOT be giving it 5 stars. But the machine did not cost much and I have used it daily, which is around 500 cups of delicious cappuccino for less than $.20 each. So I did get my moneys worth. It's been acting strange for a few days. I always warm it up for 15 minutes but beginning yesterday, the espresso is weak and cool. I think maybe the heating element has gone out. Steaming has been acting up for a couple months, but today it got worse. When it's switched over to steam, it just sits there. After maybe 40 seconds of silence, it starts sputtering out a stream of water which slowly turns to steam. Once it does start steaming it does a great job! But the cool weak espresso is the end of it. I'll be ordering a new espresso machine in the next day or two and it won't be this one. Cuisinart has a 3 year warranty....maybe I'll try that one. Edit: one week later.....my brand new Delonghi EC155 is sitting on my counter and I am happy. Last week after my old one broke, I went on the hunt for a new espresso machine. I didn't want to order one....I have gotten quite used to a fresh cappuccino every morning so I wanted one I could get locally. The Cuisinart that I wanted would need to be ordered. I got a Krups espresso machine that was sitting on the shelf at my local Bed Bath and Beyond. What a piece of junk! I was unable to make that machine produce a decent foam and the water tank had a strong chemical smell. So I returned it and ordered another Delonghi (2-day shipping) only this time , I spent $13 on an extended 3 year warranty. So that will solve the problem. Edit: 12/2011. As expected, my replacement Delonghi EC155 lasted 20 months and failed. This time it was the espresso part that would not work. The steam part works just fine. Thank goodness I got the extended warranty. I ordered yet another Delonghi EC155 today.....my 3rd one. I use this machine every single day (for less money....only $79 plus it has a $20 rebate) so even if 18 to 20 months is the expected lifespan of this machine, it's still only pennies a day for delicious cappuccino. When this newest one fails, I will probably buy a 4th one.",

                "review_text": "Ten years ago I worked as a barista, and I think that previous knowledge has helped me get the best cappuccino possible out of this machine. Here are my tips: First, read the manual. It's important to know about the settings that allow the machine to heat properly. Secondly, you need to buy some extra stuff: 12 oz stainless steel steam pot, clip-on thermometer, tamper and 5 oz stainless steel pots to catch the espresso. Anything larger than a tiny little pot will not fit under the extractor. You might also want espresso mugs, too. I recommend that you tamp your espresso grounds to 30 lbs. of pressure and twist as you push downward (press downward on a scale until you get a feel for it). Steam your milk between 140-160 degrees for optimal flavor and frothing. Together, the espresso shots I pulled from the machine and the milk I steamed made a nice cappuccino. I can't wait to buy mocha and vanilla syrups to try even more kinds of drinks!",

Often, I have a big lunch at La Teresita, a small Cuban cafe and restaurant in Tampa, with my good friend Westgate. Afterward, we order big \"tazas\" of Cuban espresso, loaded with sugar. Delicious/Sabrosisima ... but how to make it at home has always been frustrating. I had a little Salton espresso machine, bought from Amazon long ago. It worked fine, but, somehow, did not come up to the standards of La Teresita espresso. The Salton was just a \"steamer.\" So, a search of Amazon's store revealed the DeLonghi EC155 espresso/cappuccino maker. I got it for an Xmas present to myself. This morning I used it for the first time. the instructions were a bit befuddling, however I surmounted that and gave it the required five rinsings with water passing through the system. Then came time to make the espresso. I didn't have a fancy espresso cup, so I used a short coffee cup. Soon the coffee came out, with a nice foam on the top, something that the Salton would not do. Adding the sugar that I like ... I was suddenly in La Teresita Cuban Cafe. The primary secret was the internal pump in the DeLonghi ... it's not just a steamer. I liked it a lot ... so I ordered a replacement when it died after 3 years. Next one sounded like an airplane going overhead ... and the thing jiggled so much that coffee cups would bounce off. Amazon sent another one .. much quieter ... however, I am lowering my rating to 4 stars because of the noisy pump",

It does not have an automatic shut-off, so you will have to keep an eye on your espresso and make sure it isn't geting too watery. I LOVE mine!!! I have had it for over a year and a half and have NEVER had an issue with it. Easy to clean, easy to use and GREAT results! If you have never had an espresso machine before (this is my first) this is a GREAT place to start! Cheap- compared to most other machines, works AWESOME and makes super yummy espresso drinks!

I make my own shots, steam my own fully organic milk and have a heavenly cup each morning. I use the espresso roast from Starbucks so I am not completely cutting my trips to Starbucks, however I found that using my organic milk my latte tastes better. It comes with the side coffee tamper that flattens where you put ground espresso coffee to begin doing the shots (so no need to purchase it). It is very simple to use. Add water, turn it on to heat up, once green light comes on turn it own to begin making the espresso, once done, turn all the way to the other end for the steamer to begin steaming water so you can steam milk. after a couple of minutes just open a nob that begins the steam and that's it. Its also easy clean up. make sure to run it without coffee before your first time. I bough a stainless steel pitcher for the steaming of milk, a portable coffee cup (Starbucks, ~$22) that is stainless in and out since milk stinks if it sits in there after you are finished and by the time you get home from work, it smells bad and stays bad (if its plastic). Coffee/milk drinkers, always gets stainless steel in and out on the coffee portable cups. Plus they are also much better at keeping coffee warm for HOURS! and the outside remains cool and comfortable for easy handling.",

I have quirks with it that I would like to not have when making coffee. Mostly that my favorite mug does not fit under it. In fact it misses only my a few millimeters. Oh well. I also think the steamer is a bit weak. Though I have not had much experience steaming milk prior I think this one is probably not as good as others. This machine was a great intro into making espresso. I am glad I bought it and I do use it everyday. I will be able to buy my next machine with better knowledge of what I am looking for.

Obviously, I need a thick crema and I want to see a dark heart. This machine has consistently given me perfect pulls from the first shot. I often marvel at the beautiful separation of the espresso while it's pouring and savor the final shot... whether I'm making a straight espresso or a homemade iced caramel macchiato. Seriously. If you're going to get this machine, get clear shot glasses. You're going to love watching this thing work. Now, the only draw back is its squat design. I literally have to tip my 1oz shot glasses to get them under the portafilter. Yeah, I could remove the stainless steel bottom for an extra inch... so, that's a possible solution to that problem. With regards to the wand issue that others have mentioned, that it is too short and too close to the counter, I just put the machine on a little stand that gives me extra space. Again, I don't know how they expect anyone to use the steam wand on a flat counter, but there are options. Final verdict, the price and quality of shot are worth negotiating the short design.

I kept wanting to get a pump-driven espresso machine, but there are so many choices, and the costs are sometimes a bit overwhelming. Anyway, when this went on sale, I snapped one up. I have been using it for a few weeks now. It has been exactly what I was hoping for. The coffee, after some trial and error, tastes great. I am still developing my skills on the foamer side, but it works like a charm. This is the best entry level espresso maker that I have played with. I have used others at friend's and family's houses. All of that praise stated, you need a small and wide foam pitcher to work with the steamer. It is a little awkward, but that is my only criticism.

I have to put two cappuccinos-worth of milk in my regular-sized frothing pitcher so that the wand reaches the top of the milk - Steam wand is hard to clean. Getting anything up inside the black cover on the tip is difficult. Once, it even clogged and the next time I turned on the wand, nothing came out, then, all of a sudden, there was an explosion of steam. Dangerous! - Not a lot of pressure through the ground. It takes forever to get a double-shot. All that being said, I'm quite happy with my purchase. I bought, as recommended by other reviews, RSVP Terry's Tamper so I don't have to use the built-in. I don't use the machine as often as I thought due to how time-consuming it can be, but it's still a nice treat on weekends. Knowing everything I dislike about this machine, I still would have bought it because you can't beat the price.",

If you are new to espresso machines, start by using Illy coffee. 2. The built in tamper presses the coffee down enough. 3. When frothing, let the water heat up in frothing mode for a few minutes after the green ok light turns on. This way you end up with practically no extra water added to your steamed milk. I learned this by accident. 4. For the first use of the day, run though some heated water, before adding coffee.",

                "review_text": "I did a good deal of research before purchasing this machine. I saw a lot of pros and cons for it, but more pros, so I though this would be a great one for the price. So far I have not been disappointed. We had several guests in town yesterday and I ended up having to make about 10-12 cups of espresso for everyone and each one came out with a wonderful flavor and lovely crema on top. As I was reading through the reviews prior to purchase, there were a few other reviewers who gave good tips on a frothing pitcher, a tamp (because I did not realize this one came with a built in one) and some helpful hints. So this is a consolidation of those hints and my experience. My biggest concern with this machine was soupy grinds instead of a hard puck. But since I knew many people had given helpful reviews, I came back to do some research and found my answer. Which was simple, the espresso basket needs to have more espresso in it. Fill the basket until you have a \"cone\" of coffee that rises above the edge, then use the built in or if you prefer external tamp. Don't press too hard or the grinds will be too packed for the water to penetrate. Make sure to wipe excess from the edges. However, even with the soupy grinds that were left over, I still got a great flavor and beautifully colored crema in each pull. Several people pointed out that there were water pitcher leaks, I haven't had an issue with that, because when I put it in after filling it, I just make sure to press it down well, you can feel when it is pushed all the way down in place. It recommends 15 minutes of heating, but it doesn't take that long, I turn it on to heat while I'm getting down cups and preparing everything, then do the water run, to make sure it's good and hot. Yesterday, when I had so many guests, I just did one water run, because it was in constant use, and everything was piping hot, even with a few minutes in between uses. I saw some comments that the machine does not cut itself off, so the pull would just keep running making things watery. There's a green \"OK\" light that should be on when you start your pull, and the moment it turns off, just flip the switch back to the warming position or off (if you aren't pulling anymore shots). Many complained that the steam wand made their milk watery. Even professional machines that baristas use in shops will build up water in the steam wand. Years and years ago I was a barista (so when I was getting soupy grinds I was concerned since I did use to do it for a living), and if you express the steam wand before using it, you won't have this issue. I just stick a paper towel under the area the wand is pointed at and turn it on low until all water comes out. Then I already have the paper towel just in case I spill anything from the pitcher or let it over flow. The frothing pitcher http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MR6I9I/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 is a good size, I believe this one is the 12 ounce, someone else also recommended a 10 ounce, I think either is fine. It fits under the nozzle well, and the only issue I would have is if I build the froth up to the edge of the pitcher, but that's more to do with me than the machine. Either tamp works, I personally like having an external one, but that's just personal preference and it's not expensive. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XRNEM/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 You do need a smaller cup to fit under the machine, I have had some demi cups for years that fit wonderfully, so that hasn't been an issue. I do not have these, but based on the measurements they are probably a great option. http://www.amazon.com/BIA-Cordon-Bleu-Bistro-Espresso/dp/B000Q935OI/ref=sr_1_7?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1398088082&sr=1-7&keywords=demi+cups Overall, for the price and the ease of making espresso, this is a great machine. All of the parts of the filter come apart easily for cleaning, it's easy to unscrew and wash the steam wand guard, then screw it back on and the storage for the extra single shot filter is great. It doesn't take up much space and is easy to operate.",

                "review_text": "I owned one of these years ago but moved on to a higher end model, which my wife never got the handle of. After two years of me being the only one who could pull a decent shot, we went user friendly a Nespresso unit that, while dead simple to use, is expensive due to pod costs and, frankly, makes barely passable espresso. (The Nespresso caps contain 5 grams of coffee, but a decent shot needs 7 grams.) We rocked Nespresso for three years, but I got tired of weak shots and high-cost pods, so we looked at all our options (and our budget) and realized that the De'Longhi model we started on was the right solution for us. The story on this machine is simple- with the right ESE pod, anybody can pull a very drinkable shot. With the right ground coffee and a little skill, you can make a very good shot. And you get all of this at a very friendly price. On the down side, the machine relies on pressurized portafilters and lacks a 3-way solenoid valve, so you will never pull the perfect shot with mountains of tiger-stripped cream, and you will always have to clean a soggy puck. However, that is true for most machines under $500 anyway, so unless you've got big bucks to invest on a Miss Silvia, this cheapie will most likely serve your purpose and save you money. The other feature I'm not in love with is the steam wand, but you can whisk cold milk and microwave it pretty easy and get froth for days. Just make sure you do the \"Mr. Miagi\" with the whisk to get the fine foam you crave. Bottom line, this is a fantastic entry-level espresso machine that will serve the needs of all but the most picky coffee geeks. UPDATE- after use, this machine doesn't seem to brew at a consistent temp. Occasionally, my shots taste a bit scorched. Also, the steam wand leaks. I stand by my original claim that you cannot get a better machine for the money, or even double the money. That said, I am contemplating saving up for one of those better machine all the same.",

                "review_text": "Review UPDATE!! Below is my original review...I have had this machine now for several months, I've used it every day at least once a day and it still works as good as new. I love it and am so incredibly happy with it! So I have to say I was kinda scared to buy this. There are so many reviews out there with it some good some bad. Some of them were saying it vibrates so hard it shakes the cup off. Others the steamer was poor, ect; Well here is a little background about 10 years ago I worked at a coffee shop for around 3 years and I have to say I know how to make a good cup of coffee. So I decided for the price Id give it a go and I LOVE IT! The espresso shots come out perfect with just the right amount of cream. The steamer works wonderfully...Yes its a little short not much room to work with but we have it at the edge of our counter so just hold the steamer to the side so we can easily remove the frothing pitcher. If you don't have this option I can see why it would be frustrating. My husband who is not a coffee drinker at all has actually gotten up and started making himself white mocha's in the Morning. The fact that this machine offers two different size filters is perfect: he can use the small one that gives a very small shot and Me who likes around 2-4 shots of espresso in a drink can use the big filter. I will say if you aren't sure what an espresso shot is suppose to be then it will take some practice getting the grind/water ratio correct for you. All in all I say this is a perfect buy and for a wonderful price. I do plan on getting on here again in about 6 months to let you know if it's still going wonderfully*A lot of people said the problem with theirs is that it stopped working after a while** As to the cups vibrating off I use the little European tea mug one is short enough to fit under but allows both nozzles to empty into the same glass securing it from vibrating off. All in all I would say this is a wonderful buy and look forward to my morning Espresso.",

I am not a coffee snob, but if you don't use the right grind, you'll get the equivalent of bad bad drop coffee. I bought a Capresso burr grinder and now the thing pumps out great shots with excellent creama. Don't skimp and buy a blade grinder, you'll get awful shots. While the machine is not fully automatic, it's fine for me. It's not too terribly loud and does it's job efficiently. While some of the pieces feel a bit cheap, overall it's well put together and performs up-to-snuff. What I liked: -Simple to use -Quick espresso -Inexpensive -A great $20 rebate! -The frothing wand works great (but see below) What I do not like: -The space between the filter and the grating is really short. Use tiny shot glasses. -The frothing wand is really short. I had to place the machine at the end of my table to get a cup underneath it. -The customer service of Delonghi is awful. Their phone service is only open during my workday and I am waiting over a week after emailing them and still haven't received anything back. I recommend this machine for the casual espresso lover.",

To be brief, I like this purchase, a lot. Sure, its a bit of a process to make a latte, but it's a labor of love, and I kind of enjoy doing it. I would say it probably takes me about 15 minutes to make two of them, so if you're dreaming of having your latte good to go in Starbucks time, it ain't happenin. But it does make a great substitute latte, and I'll admit I can't even do drip coffee anymore. I'm a snob now, that's what this machine will do to you. Here's my morning process: 0) Turn on the machine, wait I dunno, a minute? While heating, go to #'s 1/2/3. 1) Empty the grounds from the day before 2) Put two scoops of the Lavazza grounds in the double-shot filter (I never used the single) and tamper down, secure the filter to the machine 3) Put two pumps (1Tbsp) of syrup into a coffee mug (Thermos Sipp 16-Ounce Vacuum-Insulated Travel Tumbler, Stainless Steel or Contigo 16-Ounce Double Wall Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler) 4) Brew the espresso (I usually fill a 3 oz. espresso cup to the brim) 5) Switch to steam mode, wait maybe 30 sec. Steam 4oz milk (to 150F-160F) 6) Pour espresso and steamed milk into coffee mug and repeat 1-6 for myself So again, labor of love, but for the price you really can't beat it. I wasn't willing to drop several hundred dollars on a commercial machine just to get my milk hotter, faster. You can if you'd like. Good to know: -The Lavazza grounds are the way to go. You avoid the process of having to further grind your favorite blend down to make the most of the espresso brew, plus they're super cheap via subscription. I'm all about avoiding pain when possible. -The longest part of the process, by a mile, is waiting for the milk to steam to your desired temperature. This pain can't be avoided, sorry. It's relative pain, 2-3 minutes maybe. -The next longest part of the process is simply emptying the spent grounds and putting in/tampering the new stuff. You could avoid some of this by purchasing the pods I suppose. Seemed pretty extreme to me, and not really cost efficient. -DON'T REMOVE/DETACH THE FILTER/HANDLE (TO EMPTY IT) IN STEAM MODE. Seriously, I learned this the hard way. There must be a ton of pressure built up or whatever, but if you do remove the filter (i.e. to empty the coffee grounds) in steam mode, coffee grounds will splatter all over your counter in a thunderous boom. Don't do it, you've been warned.",

Not ugly Very easy operation Has steam wand Has single and double serving tray for espresso Overall, easy to clean Cons: The steam wand has a plastic piece that needs to be taken off after steaming milk in order to clean it properly. The steam wand is so short, you can really only fit a small cup to steam milk in. I don't know why they bother with the built in tamper, it just makes a mess everywhere, buy a separate tamper. One thing to keep in mind is the unit needs to be warmed up at least 20 minutes prior to espresso making. I sometimes go longer just to make sure. This ensures a consistent extraction and makes it much more tastey. Make sure you are consistent in your preparation of your espresso, any change in your preparation and you will notice a difference in the taste. Also, for me, the turkish grind of coffee produces the best flavor. Anything coarser and there is insufficient crema. Do your research on how to extract the perfect shot and you will be fine. This is a great product and really elevates your daily caffeine intake experience.",

Sure if you have 8 extra bucks, (some reviewers may not, as it seems the way they review it) The steam valve: works great everytime. Seriously. Not sure why people were griping about it. Small space underneath: so what. Do you want your entire counter to be taken up? I remove the plate and just place my cup there. Its fine. again, 80$ machine dont expect a ferrari at the cost of a Kia. Crema and taste: seriously, machines that produce this CONSISTENTLY time after time just dont exist at the 80$ mark i am absolutely impressed. Just bought this machine have been using for one month.

Good size water container. I found that if one heats it up with the switch on steam and then quickly switch to expresso, one does not have to wait to heat it up or run an initial water run. Steam function is excellent. I have had it for six months and there have been no signs of mechanical problems. But we will have to see -- at this low price I would be pleasantly surprized if the pump lasted more than a few years. I buy distilled water to minimize possible corrosion - it is worth it at .89 a gallon. For price and quality, you cannot go wrong with this machine. I used to own a Krups pressure-type (no pump) expresso maker which really made sucky expresso and cost $30 more. Update January 15 2011. I have had this now for about six months and there have been no problems at all. I would suggest using distilled water (cost about one cent per cup) and you should not have to use chemical cleaners very often. Update August 20,2012. So far, it still works as well as before. Very occasionally, the espresso function seems to get some sort of \"vapor lock\" which slows down the feed. No problem, just let all the pressure out with the steam function, and start over.",

I left it on for hours between uses, and did not clean it. It started running weak after 8 months or so, at 2-4 shots per day, and gave out soon after. That was about 800 shots, so the machine cost me about 10 cents per shot. The second one I turned off right after each shot, and cleaned regularly using Durgol 0291 Swiss Espresso Special Decalcifier . It still started running weak after 8 months or so, at 2-4 shots per day. Cleaning it each time made it run better for a little while so it has lasted 9 months. It is pretty much giving out right now as I write. So, maybe 900 shots. Not much difference -- plus I have spent nearly as much on cleaner as I did on the machine. I thought of getting another, especially with the rebate, but instead got a DeLonghi BAR32 Retro Pump-Driven 35 ounce Espresso Maker . I cannot say how long it will last, since I just got it, but other reviewers said they got 2-3 shots for two years. It works well with the same grinds of coffee as my EC155s did, or maybe even a step finer (using a Rancilio Rocky Doserless Burr Grinder ). But it costs rather more than the EC155. And it takes a bit more space since it is a couple of inches wider and a couple of inches deeper.",

Third, I really like the convenience of getting a two gulp eye opener in the morning (a double shot of Italian blend has that effect!), and forth, after researching the espresso maker alternatives, The De'Longhi EC155 at a final cost of $59.95 (including tax, shipping, and $20.00 mail in rebate) offered the best value considering the several espresso maker reviews I read. I was not disappointed, even though I'm a novice when it comes to brewing espresso. It is extremely easy to use, and when dispensed into an espresso sized cup is quick and delicious. Clean up is a snap, and cost is less than 25 cents a cup. I would recommend using a fine or powder grind, and the built in plastic tamper works great if used properly (the brew cup, it comes with both a single and a double shot size, must be filled all the way).

With 15 bars, it's a powerful little machine for its size. I have limited counter space, and this thing takes up hardly any room at all. It's completely worth the price, and an awesome machine! Having said this, here are a couple of pointers I've figured out along the way: -Not just any steaming/frothing pitcher will work. I have never seen one small enough at a store. Many are too tall to fit under the steam wand and make for a very awkward time steaming your milk. Buy the Stainless Steel 10oz. Steaming and Frothing Pitcher here on Amazon. -DON'T clean it out with vinegar. I can't remember if the directions stated to clean it by running it with vinegar in the water for a few shots, or if I read this online somewhere, but in any case don't do it. I did it twice, and both times my coffee tasted and smelled like vinegar for weeks afterwards. I mean, I like vinegar, the smell and taste, but not in my coffee. Not cool. I suggest just running plain ol' water through it w/o coffee to clean it. If the water you're using isn't too hard, the inside workings of the machine shouldn't get too 'dirty' or clogged anyway.",

We loved it the first time and it lasted 1.5 years for only $99 It made great espresso! We were distraught when it broke (the pump failed). We wanted something pricier but couldn't pass up the cost on this little deal of a machine, so we bought it again, at $99! The second time around we were very happy and the machine lasted another 1.5 years until it broke, this time it was the heating element. Now these machines have been reduced even further because there is a newer version on the market, and although we were still thinking we will eventually buy something more elaborate and expensive, we bit again, this time at $79, figuring we will have another 1.5 years. For two weeks now I have exhaustively ran water through the machine, wiping, cleaning, pulling shots, and frothing and frothing. I still cannot get rid of the nasty machine oil flavor. I can't use the frother at all yet, because it keeps leaving the disgusting taste in my milk. We have actually been drinking the espresso with microwaved milk. Hubby seems to think it's getting a little better, but my taste buds aren't buying it yet. Ok, I suppose it is improving, but please be aware that you need to follow the manufacturer's instructions and THEN SOME before you will see results...it could be weeks! The plus side is the crema is beautiful. ;) Amazon only allows returns if the package is unopened and unused, so we are out $79 this time if taste doesn't improve. It's hard to write a bad review on something that was not a problem in the past, but I think in this case (and probably because messing with my caffeine makes me angry) you needed to know. My advice is to buy it somewhere you can return it, just in case this problem doesn't go away. and, purge on! 9/2013 Update. This machine is still working great and we love the coffee. So now, 5 years later, we still love our morning coffee. Incidentally, this machine that I complained about purging the machine oil taste has lasted longer than the first two and is still running great. We use is at least twice every day. Two thumbs up!",

Having gone to school at Berkeley, my standard became Peet's coffee, brewed at one of their stores there (I'll add that the ones in Sacramento aren't as good. Must be the water...). I've got French Presses, gold filters, paper filters, two steam espresso gizmos. Etc. All left me whimpering in defeat. A recent several week trip through Italy & France got me addicted to just the pure espresso drink -- no milk, no frou-frou. No nothin'. Tiny little cup of espresso after great meal. Got home and started looking at espresso machines knowing, with my record, I was doomed to failure. But, shazzam! this DeLonghi actually works. I got a set of 'chat noir' demitasse cups and am, once more sipping something darned close to what I had in Italy. I'm currently using Peet's (who proudly kept their apostrophe, vs. that other coffee place) Major Dickenson, but will try the pods at some point. I run a few shots of hot water through it before brewing. Haven't used the steamer or anything else nor am I bothered by the low clearance for cups. Got to use the demitasse cup so the little finger is properly extended when sipping... . Anyway, worked great the first time. Used for 3 solid weeks now. Highly recommended. Update: February 2012. I don't know what the market is now for low-priced espresso makers -- maybe there's others now at a low price -- but this puppy is still going! I still think it's great.",

There is even a small form factor to this machine, so it does not encroach on your counter real estate. One little issue I feel should be addressed is that when when the machine is making steam or even espresso, it cannot hold to the proper temperature for the required time to complete the job. I find myself waiting for the machine to heat up again before proceeding, which can be slightly annoying, however the end product is still great. If you are learning how to make espresso or just want to indulge on occasion, then this is a really great machine to learn on. It is not by far the best option, but seeing as espresso machines typically run into the hundreds to thousands of dollars, this is a safe bet and is well worth it.

For the price, I'm very, very pleased and I look forward to not only drinking my cup (or 2) of espresso every morning, but also going through the process of preparing and brewing. When you're ready to brew and you turn the knob to pressurize the chamber and force the water through the coffee puck, the unit is a bit noisy and it vibrates a little more than you would like, but they are small deficiencies given the very low price and the high quality cup of espresso you are able to produce.",

Clean up is not horrible, but I would recommend that it be done immediately, not 5 or 10 minutes later. the grinds will get stuck in the strainer cup and the frothed milk with evaporate from the steamer arm. Then you got to scrub it rather than wipe it. We had one problem once, and it wasn't the machine, but the grinds. We bought some other brand espresso beans and ground them in the Kroger store grinder on the espresso setting. It was so fine the machine couldn't get water through the grinds. It was giving a drop every 5 seconds. I had to mix the grinds with another bag and that helped a bit. Just make sure you don't get grinds to fine. You should have a shot of espresso in about 20 sec.

But there are a number of design elements that are a little problematic and instructions are not clear. So here we go with the areas that need improvement: 1. The picture shown makes the machine look taller and thinner than it actually is. It is quite low and there is not a lot of room to work with either the espresso making part or the frother. 2. We bought the suggested frothing pitcher only to learn that the pitcher is recommended by Amazon, not by DeLonghi. That little pitcher is too small. We contacted DeLonghi and they said, \"Oh, you don't use a frothing pitcher with that unit, you just use your cup.\" Okay,good to know, would have been nice to know up front! 3. Whatever you use for frothing - pitcher or cup - you have to hold it - you can't put it down because the frother doesn't reach down far enough. 4. Be careful what size espresso shot glasses you buy! A 3 inch glass will be too tall and won't fit. DeLonghi doesn't give you any instructions or dimensions for this - you have to figure it out on your own. You want the 1.5 oz glasses that are 2.38 inches tall and 1.88 inches wide. 5. Instructions are poor, especially with regard to things like the appropriate accessories. As we said, despite all this, we have figured out how to make good mochas. We make the espresso first, mix in Ghiardelli chocolate (we recommend the squeeze bottles - you can buy them on Amazon) then froth 4 oz. milk in the mug and then add the espresso to that. Yum. Oh yeah - and a dollop of whipped cream.",

                "review_text": "This machine must be judged for what it is and for whom it's designed: it is an inexpensive, entry-level espresso/cappuccino maker made for beginners. If you want to control water temperature and pressure, and if you care about how long ago your beans were roasted and how the husk was removed, this is not your new machine. If you are like me--someone who enjoys the taste of cappuccino and likes making it for yourself and your spouse--then this machine is a darling. In my estimation, with this machine, and as a beginner, I make better cappuccino than any that I've had at an American coffee chain (that is not a grand claim if you include Starbucks, which in my estimation makes truly awful coffee), and on par with what I can get at my favorite mid-range restaurant. My wife and daughter agree, at least to my face. To see how to use it and some good (if somewhat goofy) explanations, see the \"Crew Review: DeLonghi EC155\" YouTube video. I have now owned the machine for four months or so, and this is what I have learned: 1. Keep the machine clean. 2. Before steaming your milk, run some steam through the steam arm to drive out the water that has condensed. If you do not, you will dilute your milk with water. 3. Contrary to other reviewers, I have found that the built-in tamper works just fine, since with this kind of machine you do not need to tamp with much pressure (see the video). 4. Twice I have ground my coffee too finely and the machine has \"over-extracted\" (I believe that is the correct term): the water spends too much time in contact with the grounds and the espresso drips out slowly, it is black with very little crema, and it tastes extremely strong and bitter. Both times I thought something was wrong with the machine, but it worked well when I changed how I ground. With my new burr grinder I find that I have to grind one or two notches coarser than the finest grind. 5. I make my espresso with Eight O'Clock Bean, whole bean, Colombian roast coffee, and I find it to be delicious. I have tried more expensive beans and others that are especially roasted for making espresso and cannot really tell the difference. If I were not adding the frothed milk, I probably could. 6. If you wish to use a tall mug or cup, you will need to remove the drip tray, which is easily done. 7. The steam arm is a bit low as well, but it works just fine if you have a low pitcher. Amazon sells one. 8. It may very well be that after some time will will begin desiring a more expensive and versatile machine as my taste begins to become more discerning. That will take some research, because DeLonghi makes more expensive machines than this one, but I have watched some YouTube videos about them, and as far as I can tell, they cost more because they are larger. Otherwise they operate nearly identically to the EC 155: they can brew one single or double shot at a time, and they brew in the same way, so I anticipate that the coffee would taste no differently. 9. I have nothing negative to say (that could change the longer I own the machine); I believe that many who have reviewed the machine negatively have not researched how to make espresso with this kind of machine and they have not followed directions (it is also possible that DeLonghi ships some lemons). Many who give the machine some cons are probably rating it in a classification in which it does not belong. I give the machine the highest recommendation, considering what you get for the money. Addendum 4/28/2013, five months after purchase. I still rate this machine with five stars. I add the following tips: 1. Allow the machine to heat for the full 15 minutes stated in the instructions. The green light will come on after just a minute or so, but the machine will produce much better steam when it is fully heated. I presume this also has an effect on the flavor of the coffee. 2. From some Youtube videos I have learned that high-end cappuccino makers produce what people call \"dry\" steam. This one does not. To get the steam as dry as possible, before frothing the milk I run the steam for awhile into a plastic cup, which I sometimes cover with a cloth, until the steam arm stops sputtering. 3. Different coffees behave differently in the machine. I noted earlier that I do not grind on the finest setting. That was because I was trying out a new coffee. I don't know what it is about that particular coffee, but I could not grind it as fine as I can others. 4. Skim milk froths just fine, but whole milk tastes much better. I have also learned that frothed milk should have the consistency of wet paint. To achieve this, I immerse the steam head about 1/4 inch into the milk and try to hold the milk pitcher at the same level as the volume of the milk increases, without allowing the plastic head to become completely immersed in the milk. It's possible to treble the volume of the milk, but you'll get better consistency if you double it or a little more. What you don't want is foam: large bubbles that you can make out with the naked eye. If you get them, swirl the milk around some and tap the pitcher on the counter top until they subside. You want milk with the same, thick consistency throughout 5. Froth the milk before you make the espresso. If it needs swirling, I swirl the milk while the espresso is brewing. If you allow the milk to sit, it will begin to separate with milk-consistency milk on the bottom and foam on the top. 6. I \"pull\" a double shot for about 20 seconds (I have yet to use the single shot filter that comes with the machine). A little more and the espresso is too weak to my taste, a little less and it's too strong. 7. The time you need for a good shot will also depend on the type of coffee you're using, how finely you grind it, and how firmly you tamp it. So you'll spend some time figuring out which variables you'll play with to get the coffee you like. 8. I'm about to purchase a coffee tamper that fits the filter. I believe it requires a 53 millimeter tamper. The tamper on the machine continues to work just fine, and I believe because of how the machine brews it does not require 30 pounds of pressure as some machines do.",

The machine was very easy to set up, had it up and heating water in less than two minutes. The twist knob on top has a solid feel and turns easily so hopefully will hold up well over time. The turn dial on front has a nice solid feel to it as you turn it so again I'm hopeful there will be long term appeal. The steam wand is different on this machine than my old espresso maker, this one has a black 'nozzle' that screws on the end which turns out is pretty handy, makes it easier to manage tip depths and the foam I've gotten so far had a nice fluffy consistency. One downside I did find, the machine is rather light and so when you connect the filter basket holder and turn it to tighten the machine turns with it, kind of annoying but I am thinking about getting a small rubber matt or something like that and put it under it to prevent that. Another feature this machine has that I didnt know about until after I set it up is there is a tamper actually built onto the machine which is really awesome because I lost mine! My last latte machine was over 500 dollars and this one I paid 75 dollars for; overall with the performance this is delivering I just dont see any reason to spend as much as I did in the past on a machine.",

Excellent crema with a smooth taste and not too bitter like the previous versions I've used. Yes, the grounds basket is too low so improvisation is needed but, once you have that figured out, no problem. The grounds basket also tends to be a little soupy after the espresso it made, but I can't say that I mind at all. I would definitely recommend this machine to people and will buy again. The one major con I have is the directions are awful. They are inconsistent with what they tell you to do when it comes to the time period required for the machine to heat up. One paragraph said to wait 15 minutes for the machine to warm up while another said to wait 30 minutes. Then it contradicted itself by stating to wait for the green light to appear before making the espresso. Well, the green light tends to appear after 1 minute or less. This discrepancy is important due to the increased possibility of burning out the heater more quickly. So, we began making the espresso after the light turned green and didn't wait the 15 or 30 minutes it stated. It was still hot (most of the time) though I can see the need to wait a few minutes (max) after the light turns green. After months of use, it does take a little longer for the machine to heat up (another minute or so) but I would contribute this more to user error than machine error. Given we run the thing a couple times each day, ever day, I'd say it's done an excellent job. 5/5 for me. Will definitely buy again.",

I am an admitted espresso snob so I researched the heck out of machines. After my research I settled on the De'Longhi EC155 and was fairly happy with it from the start. It made a pretty decent espresso shot when using a good dark roast, the correct fine grind and made sure it was correctly packed down. and for the price I thought it was well worth it, I saved quiet a bit of money, controlling the ingredients and calories in my lattes and having fun making drinks for myself and my friends. But after about 10 months the steam wand quit working, then about a month after that the pump for making espresso stopped working altogether. I did use it almost everyday, sometimes 2 times a day but I always cleaned it and used distilled water so I felt like it should have lasted longer than it did. My coffee maker cost less and my husband never cleans it and it lasted 3 years so I was little disappointed by that. But in the long run it paid for itself 10 times over (Uh, $5 a day or more for a lattes x 10 months is around $1500!!) and for me was worth it since I don't have $700 to drop on an espresso machine. Here are some things I wanted to note: I did have a hard time at first getting the steam knob to work because the factory had over tightened it so hard that the knob was stuck and it was twisted in the wrong direction (not the normal righty tighty) so after a lot of fussing my husband FINALLY got it unstuck. But the knob was always a bit lose after that. The Espresso from my machine always tastes burnt if you brew it after steaming your milk, my assumption is the machine is just getting too hot to create the steam that its not cooling down enough before I would pull the espresso shot, and burns the coffee, but according to the product description its not supposed to. (it did for me anyways) The machine would rattle and shake when making a shot if the water was even remotely below 30% water (probably because its a mostly plastic not very heavy duty machine) The size is nice and small, I was worried because my husband drinks only coffee so we have a coffee maker and a espresso machine on the counter but it was the perfect counter top size. about 1/t the size of our coffee maker. Overall for the money I think its a pretty good deal for someone who wants to make lattes at home and is on a budget. I'm even looking into buying a replacement De'Longhi I'm just hoping it lasts longer.",

                "review_text": "After FOUR YEARS - UPDATED - this machine is a little workhorse. It has never failed me and continues to make beautiful espressos every morning. I descale it about once or twice a year. Lovely, dependable little machine. I buy whole bean, light roast, and grind myself in a burr grinder. The whole process smells heavenly and starts the day with joy. I would buy again in a heartbeat! AFTER TWO YEARS --UPDATED - this little machine is my morning buddy, 2-3 espressos every day, going strong. It works like a charm. Wipe it clean every day, take the little filters apart about once a week and wash, and descale maybe twice a year. The espresso is delicious. I travel regularly to Italy and am picky about my coffee. This will froth milk beautifully but remember that this machine has a single boiler and will need time to build pressure back up between the two functions. Translated, leave five minutes between milk drinks. I could not be more satisfied with this purchase. I love this little machine and I enjoy taking care of it. It has been used daily for almost two years, very reliable. Like a car it will thrive with proper maintenance. ------------------- PREVIOUS UPDATE ---I've had this little machine for almost three months now and continue to be pleased with it. I wanted to share a maintenance tip - descaling is necessary! As I had read in numerous places, the EC155 requires descaling after about 200 coffees in order to remove mineral deposits on the boiler. Sure enough, as mentioned elsewhere, the EC155 began running slowly after about two months of use, barely dripping coffee into the cup, and I have been very regular about cleaning the filters and the group head screen. So as mentioned in the manual, I bought a commercial descaling powder, poured it into the full water container in the machine, ran it through, followed by a full clean container (this took about an hour, all told) - and voila! It runs as it did when it was brand new! Just like changing the oil in the car - take care of your machines and they will pay you back. This machine makes lovely espresso. Some tips: Let the machine warm up 20 minutes prior to use and then run it only when the green light is on, for pressurized water that is hot. When the espresso is done, leave the filter in place for about a minute to let the pressure dissipate. This will avoid removing it too soon and the residual pressure spewing the coffee out. When frothing milk, make your shot first, wait a minute, remove the portafiler, flush and wipe the grouphead, and then switch the dial over to steam. Wait a couple of minutes so the pressure between the two sides settles down. Then froth your milk. Yes, the espresso has cooled down, but your milk is nice and hot and everything will be lovely. This is probably my only little complaint with this machine - the boiler serves both the coffee side and the milk side, and you have to be patient with the pressure requirements between the two. If you are enjoying several espressos every day, plan on descaling the machine once a month. It makes the machine run like new. Once a week, take apart your filters and unscrew the grouphead. Clean the screens. Makes a difference in taste if you get all the old coffee out. YOu wouldn't want to eat old pieces of pie in with new, would you? Of course not. For maximum happiness, buy a better tamper. The one on the machine works, but to me the diameter is a bit too small and also it is slightly angled. This makes it hard to get your coffee flat, and you get a ridge all the way around. A good tamper makes you feel all warm inside and the coffee pours out more evenly. Remember: descale once a month! You will be glad! Enjoy. This machine is great value for the money if you clean it properly. Wonderful espresso. ORIGINAL REVIEW -- I have never made anything but drip coffee all my life, but now I am totally hooked on this little machine. I've had it for about two weeks and the result is delicious! I learned from YouTube videos and it was pretty easy to start out. I use Illy Dark Roast grounds and I enjoy the whole process of measuring, tamping (and I like the built-in tamper because it is convenient and consistent), pulling the shot, and using the grounds for compost. I even like cleaning everything and leaving it all ready for the next time. The machine is quiet and makes the house smell heavenly. The crema is a lovely light brown and soft so I think that is correct! My husband is thrilled with this addition to our life. I just started trying cappuccino and I haven't got the frothing right yet, but that is my problem and not the machine's. I found true little espresso cups and they fit nicely, also little plastic shot glasses work fine. I love this machine.",

I used to go to Starbucks daily. Since receiving this machine, I have only been their three time. And that was just to use up the money on my gold card. I have had other espresso machines in the past and none of them seamed to do a very good job, This little machine not only produces an excellent espresso shot but also does a great job at frothing milk! The wand is a little low but I have this at the end of the counter so I don't have any problems. I have not had any problems with leaking either! Very good quality! Would definitely suggest this to anyone that wanted a good at home machine!",

Pretty easy to use, no complaints, makes a good espresso and a nice full cup using a single fill of the double cup size dispenser. Had it about a month, been on daily duty for the last week or so.

Easy to froth the milk if you want to make cappuccino. The four star rating is because the cheap design of the frother. You supposed to unscrew and clean the plastic frothing head every time after it is used. It is too easy to cross thread it when putting it back, since the the soft plastic piece will not guide well. They should had put a metal, threaded insert in the plastic since it is to be removed frequently. Because of this I mostly avoid making cappuccino. Another minor frustration is the tamper to compact the coffee grind, where it is placed. Very awkward to to use it. Giving it as a separate attachment would had been much more useful.",

Lived in Firenze for nearly 2 years...had good coffee there and all over the rest of Italy...but never a cappuccino as hot as I wanted...even after learning the word 'bolente' from a local....this machine changed that...I now have my cappuccino exactly as hot as I like it. The only down side so far is that I am addicted....at least 2 cups per day since the machine was delivered. Ordered the tamper (50 & 60 mm size), EP 12 ss frothing pitcher and Lavazza crema e gusto ground coffee along with the EC155 purchase and have not regretted any purchase. Some of the users suggested removing the black end to the steamer and that was the first thing I did. Yes, it makes sense to get cups that will fit below the spouts...bought those as well...Konitz cappuccino cups and Norpro demitasse cups..these too were worth it. No operating issues so far....great 'crema'..so far. Will be interesting to see what is the effort needed to clean it when the need arises.... other than that, if this even lasts 6 months it will have paid for itself many times over...fingers crossed.",

It is also quite easy to spill out of the reservoir by just moving it.Practice common sense. If your shots are not coming out right, go on youtube and learn how to make espresso or read the documentation provided. This machine works perfectly so I couldn't imagine someone not being able to make great shots unless they either do not know what they are doing or have a faulty machine, which is possible. Despite some minor engineering and design complaints, this is a fantastic machine. At the price, it is unbeatable.",

An espresso comes out with a beautiful, sweet coffee foam, and the milk steamer is nice, too -- perhaps not the frothiest but for my taste it suits just fine. The only problem I had with the maker was as a result of my carelessness: I forgot to turn it off now and then, leaving it on for a day at a time, and the thermostat burned out. Fortunately, this happened within the warranty period and I was able to get it repaired. Now I diligently turn the machine off when removing my coffee and it has worked like a champ ever since. Also, like any other item that heats water, periodic cleaning with vinegar will be needed to keep the nozzles from clogging. Highly recommend this espresso maker if you want a budget machine that delivers.",

                "review_text": "I purchased this espresso maker after a prolonged comparison search on the internet and I am very happy with it. I wasn't interested (or capable) in spending a couple grand for a top of the line machine, my price range was up to around $400. I searched & searched the internet for reviews and found this machine brought up numerous times. The price was less than 1/4 of what I had planned to spend, which was good from a financial point, but a bit concerning from a quality point. Upon arrival, I cleaned everything up as directed in the instructions. Initially, I was using preground espresso beans, and they worked very well with this machine. I had recently been given a low end burr grinder for Christmas and I did find some issues when I started to grind the beans myself. I ground the beans to, what appeared to me anyway, the same size as the preground beans I had initially used. Things did not work well! The espresso came out very watery and with no crema. I ground the beans down to a smaller size (which appeared much smaller than the preground espresso beans I purchased) and they still didn't work. I was about to give up, but I decided to turn the grinder to its finest setting and give it 1 more try. When I put the finest ground beans into the machine, it brewed up a very nice espresso with a thick layer of crema. I prefer lattes over straight espressos or cappuccinos and I was very happy with the first cafe mocha that came out. I've tried a few other lattes and they've all turned out very well. The frothing wand works great. The first frothing I did ended up being more of a cappuccino form than a latte form, but I learned my lesson and I haven't made the mistake again. I've only been using it for about a week, but I am very happy with it so far! UPDATE: I've continued using this machine most every day and things are just getting better. The low end grinder is still working great too. The first lattes I made using this machine tasted fine, but I couldn't get the froth to the level I wanted it. Since the flavor was okay, I wasn't too concerned about the froth, in fact, I had accepted it the way it was. Then one day, I was frothing up my milk and I noticed it was very evenly aired. It had a very nice shine to it. I pounded it on the table a few times to ensure a nice mixture of the air and liquid and started the shot brewing. I made the mistake of letting the frothed milk sit without movement for a few minutes and I noticed the air appeared to have bubbled back up to the top of the milk. The next day, I made sure I kept the frothed milk spinning around while the espresso brewed and when I poured it into the espresso, it looked different than I had seen before in my lattes. It looked like the lattes I see on the internet where I have been attempting to learn proper technique. The air bubbles were nicely mixed into the entire liquid of the milk and it appeared even and thick. After pouring it into the espresso, there was a nice large spot of milk in the middle of the espresso. I took a picture of it immediately and I have posted a short video of the first latte I made & then the most recent latte I made. I really thought it would take a more expensive machine to get a proper froth, but it wasn't the machine, it was my technique that was causing the problem. This machine makes a fairly good espresso and does a great job frothing. I don't particularly like straight espresso, so I don't need a perfect espresso to come out of the machine. I absolutely love the lattes this machine produces. I personally use Torani dark chocolate sauce & even add an occasional additional Torani flavor to my lattes & they taste great! I'm a very satisfied customer of this machine, especially for the price!",

                "review_text": "We recently received this after quite a bit of anticipation. I recently have become addicted to cappuccino and toured coffee shops all over the Pacific Northwest refining my tastes. I take my cappuccino dry, sans sweetener, so the taste of the espresso is very important to me. My office bought a cheap steam driven espresso maker, which is nice for an occasional cup but it produces very bitter tasting espresso. I think that is because there is not enough pressure, so you are essentially getting very strong drip coffee instead of a true espresso. Anyway, after drinking espresso for the last few months, I can no longer stand the taste of drip coffee and I knew I needed an espresso maker for home in order to reduce the amount of money I would spend at coffee shops throughout the day. I turned to Amazon for some research and decided on this unit. The size is compact. A lot of reviewers have complained about it. I simply use a ceramic sake cup when pulling shots and then pour into my travel mug. I use a 1 cup Pyrex glass measuring cup to steam my milk. Problem solved. The built in tamp works fine. I know some people have purchased a separate tamp but I do not find that to be necessary. Pre-heat time generally does not take 15 minutes. I usually turn it on to heat, grind my coffee beans, load and tamp and when I am done its ready to go! The milk frother works okay. Its not amazing. Sometimes I get a really good froth and sometimes not so much. It doesn't bother me, I just use a hand whisk to froth up my milk if its not frothy enough. I only do this on the weekends when I have more time in the morning. When I am on my way to work, I just use the frother on the machine and its fine. I guess in that case, I get a latte instead of a cappuccino, but the point to be caffeinated, not be picky about milk froth. I am not and have never been a barista, so if there are better techniques to making a cappuccino, I don't know them. But I have spent a lot of money on cappuccinos at coffee shops and this tastes just as good as anything I can get where I live. It isn't quite as good some of the coffee shops in Portland, but since I only travel there occasionally, I'm very pleased with the quality I can achieve at home. If you buy espresso based drinks at a coffee shops once a day, this is worth it. I calculated that we will have to make 24-30 drinks with it to justify the price. I drink about 2 cappucinos a day and my hubs drinks an americano in the morning, so it won't take long for us to recoup the cost. UPDATE: My machine started to drip very slow and the last two shots I pulled tasted burnt. It was producing very strong espresso but with no crema, just black, burnt, high octane espresso. It gave me a stomach ache. I was slightly annoyed. I started by running just plain water through the system, didn't help. I then ran water through the grounds basket. Helped a little. Then I took the entire grounds basket apart, including unscrewing the gasket on the bottom. I washed and rinsed it all. Now its back to new! I just pulled another shot and it was wonderfully creamy, smooth taste and fast. It was a little annoying that it already got clogged so quickly but if you just rinse it all once in a while, it will probably be fine. I also think it might have been because my DH was not grinding the coffee fine enough.",

                "review_text": "This machine performs as described, and produces a nice espresso. I have some observations related to some other reviews. The first is that it is true the steam arm is too short. This is workable, you just have to think about your pitcher size and depth or just the level of milk. Also, several people have complained about the lack of a hard puck after drawing the shot(s). I think this is a misconception about the way the espresso basket assembly is designed to work. This assembly is more complex at the outlet to regulate the flow without complete dependence on the pressure used in tamping. After experimenting with this, it seems that there is a good range of coffee compression that works just fine. I would call this a plus for the average user. It also means that suggestions to buy a separate tamper are unnecessary. The built in tamper works just fine for this machine. One other thing to note, is that for the first several uses, a bit more water comes through before you activate the pump than you might expect. This stopped after something like 10 uses on my machine. Summary: Just use it according to the included directions. You will have great product with ease of use and cleaning. This is a great value! This is one gadget that hardly takes up any space, so it is easy to keep out or store as you wish. Best kitchen gadget I have ever purchased.",

                "review_text": "I've had this machine for 4 months. I've learned a fair amount about making espresso during this time in part, due to trouble shooting this machine. It's akin to techies or car mechanics who like to tinker versus someone who wants something because it just works. I've read the comments about design flaws i.e. short wand, no room for cup to fit under boiler and porta filter, vibrating pump... all this is true but there are work arounds. I bought a frother and the pump vibration seemed worse at first and it varies...just rest a hand on it wall you pull the shot. The problem with this machine is that sometimes especially after it's thoroughly heated, it just simply is unable to push water through the portafilter even without coffee. I've descaled yes and I've had it working only to fail me again. I've learned a lot from this machine but this machine is just a 100 dollar education. Get a real machine and don't look back. ========UPDATE======== I cannot speak to the De'longhi manual. I'm not sure backflushing is addressed at all. The machine can become clogged easily. I almost tossed the machine but discovered instead to run clear water through an empty porta filter allowing it to pressurize. Placing a basin or or microfiber cloth around the edges of the base to catch water, I found that rotating the portafilter to the left while machine is running allow the machine to spit out an occlusion. Use caution, the water coming out is hot but this seems to have restored my machine to being able to produce a decent espresso.",

At the beginning of each process the unit would drip/dribble constantly until the \"steam\" cycle but still it appeared to produce little steam. The whole time the unit was extremely loud and nearly danced off the counter top. We had used a less expensive Mr. Coffee brand unit for several years but the heating element appeared to finally burn out. We made espresso daily and never had issues.

I purchased an EspressoWorks system for my office, and it's wonderfully quiet, even when frothing. The De'Longhi unit has gotten louder with use, and shakes so much during the espresso pulls that you are forced to hold the cup down while the espresso is pouring or it shakes right off the stand. And the steamer.....! It started out being simply loud, and recently has decided to get even louder, to the point where it's almost painful. It's simply not possible to make a latte in the morning without waking EVERYONE up with this unit. I'll be replacing this with the EspressoWorks system instead.",

                "review_text": "I moved from drip coffee to steam machine, then started grinding whole beans for freshness, then moved to a burr grinder for an even, consistent grind. Each step improved my coffee, and I really wanted to move up to a pump machine, but couldn't justify the cost. I started saving money and reading reviews, and this machine had by far the best reviews for the money. Things I learned after I bought it: There are more variables, so it does take a little more experimentation than a steam machine to make a good shot. But I enjoyed the process, and found even a mediocre shot from this machine is better than a good shot from my steam machine. Once I got the result I wanted, I found this machine more consistent. When adjusting your grind, time each test shot, and go finer or courser until your brewing time (from pump start to full shot) is 30 seconds. Buy the \"Frequently bought together\" tamper. The built-in tamper is permanently attached to the machine. It might be fine for leveling your grounds, but it would be difficult to tamp them with it without tipping the machine over. I ordered this tamper along with my machine, and I'm glad I did. I was concerned about a few negative reviews claiming it didn't fit, or its metal plating flaked off, but I've been using it every day for five months with no problems. For more details, read my review. The review pointing out that the machine needs to be cleaned out periodically is correct. The manual recommends cleaning it every 200 shots or when it becomes slow. There are clear cleaning instructions in the manual. It's not difficult, but I needed a very fine needle to clear out all the tiny holes. I can't comment on the steam wand, because I never use it. I didn't know how hard it would be to find a single espresso cup at a reasonable price. I drink mostly Americano. I just wanted something that would fit under the group (spout) and catch the espresso for transfer to a larger mug. The manual contradicts itself, saying you need to preheat the machine 15 minutes, or thirty minutes, or by brewing a blank shot (no coffee) before use. That's nonsense. Turn the knob to preheat, and the machine is ready as soon as the green light comes on. Even when starting cold, this takes less time than grinding the beans. You can brew a blank shot to preheat your cup, but if you are in a hurry, even this step is optional. The pump makes some noise. Not a whooshing noise like a steam machine, but a mechanical hum about as loud as an electric mixer. It only makes this noise during the actual brewing\u2014which should last about 30 seconds if you have your grind right. It is silent while heating the water. This noise is accompanied by a vibration that may cause your cup to slide off-center. I haven't had the espresso miss the cup, but I keep a close eye on it. The drip tray is removable for easy cleaning, and can go in the dishwasher. If you leave the drippings in the tray too long, they contain enough water to grow mold. Solution: Wash the drip tray frequently. I started sprinkling a little boric acid in the tray (the tray is plastic, no worry about corrosion) and when it all dissolves, (one to two months at my usage rate) I put the tray in the dishwasher. I haven't seen any mold since. Update 11 June 2016: After 2 years, water started to leak over the top of the basket instead of going through the grounds. Shops that do repairs on this machine wanted almost the price I paid on Amazon for a new machine. I tracked the problem to the gasket that seals the basket to the machine. I found a replacement online, but when I tried to remove the old gasket, I found I had to completely disassemble the machine, including several parts that were not designed to go back together. In short, this is a disposable machine, not intended to be repairable.",

The old machine was loud but this one was just impossibly loud and rattled like crazy. 3. What killed it for me though was the frother. It just could do its job and make a goof froth because the pressure would be gone in no time. I had to return it and would not recommend it to anyone.

There has been no leaking water (as long as the water reservoir is pushed in fully, it is well sealed). The espresso \"puck\" (used coffee grounds expelled from the filter basket) comes out whole and dry. No wet mess here. All I can figure is those having problems either do not tamp the grounds down firmly, or are using coffee that has not been ground fine enough. (An espresso grind should appear almost as a powder). The tip of the frothing arm, while small, is ample enough for the job). The machine makes a good cup of espresso, and is easy enough to use and maintain. I do have a couple of complaints, though. The biggest problem is the small size of the machine \u2014 more specifically the distance from the warming tray to the bottom of the filter basket holder. Most espresso demitasse cups and espresso glasses are too big to place in the 2.5 inch space that is given. A one ounce shot glass is about all I have found that can fit. Placing the bottom of the filter holder even 1 to 1.5 inches higher would have solved this problem. The other problem, for me anyway, is the espresso does not come out hot enough. Even if the warming tray, shot glass and esspress mug are all warmed before hand with extremely hot water, the espresso that comes out is just hot enough to be considered good for drinking (there is barely any steam). If it sits even five minutes, though, or if you add any steamed milk (also comes out only warm) for a latte, it is already cool enough to guzzle the entire cup in one swig without any fear of discomfort - forget burns. Coffee, and this includes espresso and lattes, should be hot \u2014 not just warm.",

If going with the nespresso make sure to go over the pros and cons. A great starter machine that I'd recommend over this is the Starbucks Barista. Do a little google search and watch some videos.

                "review_text": "I would give this all five stars, if the machine lasted more than a year. We've made coffee only over the weekends with it. We've used it gently, did not use the milk frother attachment for the most part of our usage. The machine drips water very slowly, as if there isn't enough pressure build-up. Most online recommendations suggest descaling the machine. We've tried that, but that didn't fix things either. There is no build-up, and I don't think that is our problem in any case. I don't wish to spend more money buying descaling products and invest more money into an already broken machine. It may be worth pointing out that the previous version of this machine lasted us two years and stopped working in exactly the same way. With that machine we assumed we had a defective model, or had hit some kind of a weakness or limitation in the machine. We used the previous one more often and for longer before it died. It could just be a gradual degradation in quality of materials used in these machines. I sometimes hear people saying their espresso machine lasted them ten years. I just don't see how that could be possible anymore. I am just disappointed that I need to shell out another $100 for a machine that will last us another year, or two if we are lucky. I am looking around for other options. This machine is supposedly a best seller in semi-automatic espresso machines, so it's a bit difficult to look beyond that and weigh out the reviews of the other machines in comparison with this one. Somebody in the Questions and Answers section suggested that this problem may be a result of a pump diaphragm weakness. (glimmer of hope) He also said it was unrepairable in this model, and he just had to toss it away (glimmer of hope fades away).",

Then it starts leaking. Yes, I've cleaned it regularly and carefully, and this makes no difference. Neither does replacing gaskets. It still leaks. I chalked this up to a faulty machine the first time. But given that precisely the same thing has now happened twice, it seems to be a design flaw. If you're willing to buy one every year, or you feel lucky, or don't use it very often, or are willing to station a tray underneath at all times, by all means give this product a shot. But just know you're getting what you pay for--a disposable machine that needs to be replaced way too often. UPDATED: I have further reduced the stars to one because this time, the machine only last a few months before leaking. I cleaned it religiously, and only when I disassembled it a bit did I see that there the culprits were multiple faulty parts such as washers and hoses that go bad far too quickly. I tried to replace them with parts that are available various places online, only to find that the design makes it all but impossible to repair. (Actually, it is impossible thanks to poor plastic material, mostly.) It's really a poorly designed machine unless you decide that it's disposable. But it's pretty damn expensive for that purpose. Word to the wise: Just spend a few hundred dollars on a machine that isn't a piece of crap.",

                "review_text": "I bought this machine to replace a similarly-priced Lavazza EP850 machine that I'd had for 6 years. I really loved that one, but given that it was no longer being made (I could get a new one at a few sellers) and that I wanted to be able to not use capsules, I decided to look around. I invested a good deal of time researching machines on Amazon, top-ten lists, etc. This machine seemed to be the favorite in this price range, even if some people noted its short life (I purchased the 4-year protection plan for that reason). But, for the reasons below, I returned it after 5 days. As someone who has a good deal of experiences with this type of machine, I didn't feel it was a learning curve--it is not made well for a cup of latte/cappuccino given the wand and generally a number of design flaws that are too much to overcome. I noticed immediately when I took the machine out of the box that my 3 oz tiny Le Creuset espresso mug barely fit under the handle, but since this was the only cup I planned to use I thought it OK for now, even if I couldn't figure why the design was like this. I was really surprised to read about how long the machine should warm up (15 minutes at least), given that my Lavazza one required 8-10 minutes, but perhaps this shorter duration was an exception. After letting some water drip through before putting coffee in, I found it easy to make a good-tasting shot of espresso. This is why I give the machine 2 stars. However, I noticed that after I stopped the machine it took ~10 seconds for water to stop running through - my Lavazza machine hadn't been like this. The result was lots of mess. Also contributing to the mess was that my very short espresso cup could barely fit under the holes of handle, so I couldn't get it out without tipping it a little. I really don't know how I could have a shorter cup than 3 oz. I didn't find it difficult to put the handle in its place like other reviewers have noted. One thing I didn't like with the handle and that I would have changed if I'd kept it is is that there's a big plastic part under the where the coffee drips - scalding hot coffee drips onto this plastic and then dribbles through 2 holes into the cup. Why isn't this stainless? One thing I saw on youtube videos was that people had unscrewed the plastic part and cut off the top where the coffee would run through so it's not dripping through plastic--odd. I'm not the most handy person and wouldn't know how to cut it. Nonetheless, the cup of espresso was very hot and the crema was very good. Now the steam wand. It is awful. Beyond awful. I've used my old Lavazza machine and others to froth milk. In fact, right before that machine died with the same type of milk in the same stainless container, I made froth that you could have cut with a knife it was so dense. But with this one the mechanism is very flawed. I tried 6 different times, some after watching videos and reading articles for this specific machine. I know that there are different sounds milk frothing makes and you want to be in the quiet zone--I could never find it. And the steam got so furious and hot (this isn't a good thing) after a little that I had to shut the valve quickly and milk had already spilled all over. I looked at my old Lavazza wand and I was able to take part of it off and put it onto this machine when I unscrewed the plastic part from the DeLonghi wand. This didn't work because the wand is so short (because it's so oddly close to the counter) that it doesn't extend down far enough to allow the over piece from the Lavazza machine to work. I could see the construction was so much better on the Lavazza machine and this one simply cannot work as is. And this brings me to my decision. Option A: Buy a $40 milk frothing pitcher and just abandon the one that came with the machine. This seems silly - it's defective inherently, part of what I paid for, so why should I spend more? Option B: do what every single youtube video showed: get a modification for the wand or replace it completely. Less silly because you're actually using the machine and I like machine froth (don't mind doing the work) BUT it voids your warranty. Based on reading numerous reviews, I specifically bought a 4-year protection plan, so now this would be useless if anything else on the machine broke. Option C (the winner): return it and find another machine--likely going a step or two up since it seems that lower-end machines require modifications, acceptance that parts don't work well to begin with, lots of plastic and cheap parts that break and render the machines useless, etc. After really liking my Lavazza machine for 6 years, although I wish it could have used my own coffee and the espresso temperature wasn't quite as hot as that from the DeLonghi, I can say that the DeLonghi wasn't nearly as nice in the same price bracket ($150 vs $100). The wand doesn't function well, the foam is watery and non-existent -- never could I make it double in size, unless you are willing to pay to replace it (knowing how to do so), thereby voiding your warranty, you can't overcome this. The design is really flawed in other ways. I didn't fully understand what other people wrote in their reviews, I though my espresso cup is really short, maybe they're trying with mugs, etc, but the space between the bottom of the handle and the base is far too little - I may have gotten use to it if this were the only problem. Finally, it's plain messy - the water that comes down after the espresso is done pulling, the frother gurgling like crazy. In all, despite the low price point, the cup of coffee and the aggravation are not worth it. I suggest moving up in price to get something that will really work. After my Lavazza machine working so well for 6 years, having paid just $150, I know it's possible to have a lower end machine work well. But, given what I've read and having tried this one, which gets top honors on several lists, I'm not sure what that is in 2017. Certainly not the DeLonghi EC155.",

While I was hesitant on purchasing a machine at such a low price (for what it \"is\"), it seemed like a nice, little \"apt- /or condo-sized\" machine..... but shortly after owning it a year, I regretted my decision. I found the problem, once I took the machine apart to inspect it (knowing I'd had it too long to return or even request a replacement part for). It turned out to be a little brass fitting that is primarily responsible for handling the water pressure. I couldn't tell if the threads around it had corroded & began leaking, or if the fitting itself had been damaged (& I've long since trashed my unit, so I can't provide a picture), but in either case, I don't think that a brass fitting is ideal for this machine as brass is an alloy that is commonly made from lead (i.e. something you don't want in drinking water), & even though brass has many of the same properties as copper (in that it is corrosive \"resistant\" & handles heat to some degree, & can be made \"lead free\"), it doesn't appear to have the durability needed to give this machine more than 6-12 months of use; mine lasted right at about a yr (or just after the warranty expired). Given that my problem seems to commonly arise in other buyer's experiences, I don't think I'll be getting another DeLonghi product, & regrettably cannot / will not be recommending this machine (or any DeLonghi products), to others; mainly due to that this problem has existed since I bought it (nearly 4 yrs ago now), & people are CONTINUING to have the same problem (I suspect from that fitting)..... thus.... DeLonghi knows about the problem but has yet to address it... still to this day. The price point is nice, but I'd HIGHLY recommend looking elsewhere for your coffee / espresso machine. **** As previously mentioned, my machine lasted a \"whole year\" (lol), but as an addendum, I used it perhaps once or twice per week (tops), & made sure to run a certified cleaner through it, periodically, to make sure there were no deposits building up on its internal parts. Despite all of the care (& limited use) I provided, the machine still began leaking (from that brass fitting I mentioned) GOBS of water during the brewing process; & even some after the brewing, as the machine cooled down. This machine only has a 1 yr warranty on it, & with a track record of lasting about 1 yr (or less), you'd really be better off searching elsewhere for a machine......... unless, of course...... you don't mind dishing out $100 annually on an espresso machine (I paid $100 for mine, anyway... I don't know how long it'll run at the $70 price it has now, but I honestly wouldn't even pay that -- I'd place this machine in the $30-40 tier, max., given its consistent durability issues, & other various issues I discovered with its use). Cheers, & GL to any who gamble with this machine!!",

This new model does not have the same performance and the grounds are sticking to the top portion of the water injector along with a watery mess in the filter.

The espresso and cappuccino is decent, but the mechanics of the machine itself is mostly why I gave it a low rating. When you turn it to the brew setting, the machine vibrates and has a rattle to it. It vibrates so much that you will need to move the cup under the brew stream a few times before it's done. It is also nesecary to remove the metal plate where the cup sits to put in a normal size espresso cup. The cups we have are about 2-2.5\" high and they only fit if you remove the metal plate that sits over the overflow area. I think the cups they picture will work fine (although not included...) but the cups we bought did not. Not a huge deal, but worth noting. The other issue is that the milk steamer/frother doesn't work that great and It is also a pain to clean. If you want a good espresso maker that is quiet and feels solidly built, keep looking. For the price it's not terrible, but it didn't meet my expectations.",

It steams milk well, even though the foam is not as fine as it should be. Espresso capability aside, I had several annoyances with it. 1. The silicone isolation of the water tank broke about 10 months after I got it so it would leak everywhere. My suggestion is when it's still new don't take the tank out all the time and fill with with a cup instead. 2. The dirty water pan grill doesn't fit well in the pan so it would often move around. 3. The machine is really light so every time you twist the portafilter, the whole thing will move around. Also because of the light weight, the pump will make it vibrate a lot, making our cups move about during pulls. I would only recommend this if all you want is \"an espresso/a cappuccino\" made with pre-ground coffee. If you're happy with what you get at Starbucks, you're probably going to be happy with this. I spent over a year experimenting with various coffees, grinds, and modifications but eventually ended up buying a much more expensive machine. There's just no other way if you want good home-made espresso.",

I felt that I had gotten pretty good use out of it for the time I owned it, so I (stupidly) opted to buy the same machine again. The second machine had issues almost straight out of the box, and whatever quality there was had noticeably dropped off in the time since I bought the first unit. The second one barely lasted 6 months before it was completely unusable. The milk frother went first, after about 4 or 5 months. It continued to make espresso for another month or so before the machine gave up altogether. Since that time, I have lived without an espresso machine and am now looking to buy another. There is a part of me that really loved the first machine I got-- while it lasted-- and is tempted to get another of the same model, but I won't because the quality simply isn't there. The PROS from the first machine I purchased-- If counter space is an issue, the small size is great. It made a decent cup of espresso. Good price for a pump machine-- IF it holds up more than a few months. The frother worked well, once I figured out how to use it. The CONS-- Almost too small-- it's hard to find a cup to fit under the spout. Vibrates horribly when in use. Perhaps this is due to the small/lightweight nature of the machine? Horrible ergonomics. Extremely poor quality. Yes, it's an inexpensive machine, but it breaks FAST. (I made one cup or less a day with both of my machines.)",

Then again, the next level up is the $500+ machines, so maybe I'll just buy one of these every year or two. Still, it really should last longer than it did. I'm on to iced coffee for the summer anyway, so I'll keep shopping and see if anything better pops up when I'm ready for espresso again this fall. I was very skeptical when I opened this, because it seemed very complex to use. Once I figured it out, it's a piece of cake, and it makes a really tasty cappuccino. I use it daily, and I love it. (Also, it says it takes 15 minutes to be ready, but that's wrong. It's really just a couple minutes.)

I am a coffee tyro on a budget, more so because I know that these days spending 5 times over the odds guarantees you nothing. (Those $300 plasticky dress shoes are made in the same sweatshop as the $60 plasticky dress shoes and fit just as poorly.) It didn't take much research to land on this de Longhi model. It helped that our regular coffee maker that has been faultless for many years is also a de Longhi. As someone who appreciates good industrial design (i.e., Italian) and robust construction, I didn't hesitate to order it and at under $80 there was not much risk. It has exceeded my expectations for quality and features (and probably I don't want all those extra bell$ and whistle$ anyway). It looks good on my kitchen counter and cleaning it is easy. The only quibble is the slightly awkward tamper placement, which makes it difficult to apply much force (left handers need not apply!). But any serious home barista will probably get a standalone gadget for that task anyway. I just use a wide flat bottle cap (from a Starbucks bottle hahaha) \u2013 simple. After about 60 cups so far (in the clear double-walled glass types also sold by de Longhi) and a little experimenting with coffee types and brewing variables, I can make a passable espresso. Any substandard brews are down to me and the choice of grind, not the machine. It's probably already paid for itself in 3 months, and I don't anticipate needing to 'upgrade' in future. I still have to learn cappuccinos, and I'll update this report when I have. Meantime, anyone know of an Alfa Romeo 2000 GT Veloce for sale in good condition? UPDATE, July 2015 After many more brews I have learned a lot more about espresso in general, and I've come to the conclusion that what this machine produces is strong coffee with foam on top, not espresso. Despite its claims, it does NOT produce the 9 bar pressure required at the business end of the machine where the hot water is forced through the ground coffee. However, it still a very solid and well designed machine for the price, and what it produces is still better than standard coffee shop brew, or what I can get out of a regular home coffee maker. I've tried with enough different beans to know it can't be just that. It is what it is, but it's not a machine for a serious coffee lover. UPDATE, July 2016 Well the machine is shot after about 18 months. There is obviously no pressure, and I don't have 5+ minutes of chinese water torture. I'm sure I didn't help matters by forgetting the maching for about an hour a couple of times, but I think it would have failed anyway. I guess it more than it paid for itself in coffee runs I didn't make during that time, but I expect substantially longer life than this. Any suggestions for repair are welcome. I assume there are seals that are bad, although I don't notice any leaks.",

We wanted something a little better and this was so well rated on multiple sites and in articles that we bought it. I've had it for a few weeks now and I am just not happy. For those unaccustomed to the Mr Coffee machine: You add your coffee, tamp it, and then dump the appropriate water in the top, turn a knob and walk away. The result is a strong, tasty brew. For this one, you're supposed to wait like 15 minutes after your turn it on to brew. Had I known that prior to buying it, I wouldn't have bought it. I don't have time for that. Once you are able to turn the knob for it to brew, you have to sit there and babysit it and stop it once it's brewed the shot(s) or it will just keep running until it runs out of water. It's loud as others have said and the cup has to be held or it vibrates off the machine. I typically like 4 shots so it takes a while to do all of this once you load it (only takes 2 at a time unlike the Mr Coffee that takes 4). I could live with that except the result isn't particularly flavorful. I'm using the same coffee I've always used. I'm really disappointed.",

I bought it because of the stainless steel water reservoir. The first one of these I bought worked about 18 months before the pump on the coffee side would no longer function. My prior Krups machine had lasted for 4 years before I switched to the De'Longhi. I bought another DeLonghi in December and it came broken, making a metal scraping sound and putting out mostly water. Amazon did a nice job replacing it for me quickly. The new machine I received two weeks ago works as it's supposed to. My concern is that it only produces enough expresso for one cup of about 4 ounces. After 4 ounces, the machine produces almost clear water. My Krups machine made more with the same amount of coffee. I have to wonder if the De'Longhi manufacturing process has fallen below expected like so many things made in China. Big Italian name, poor quality. Update - the machine is not working properly, and cleaning for calcification has not helped. I think these machines are not meant to last more than 12 - 18 months. I am looking for a new machine again.",

                "review_text": "I will say that I now own three of these machines, but not by choice, and here is why. I had wanted to replace my older Krups machine, but that exists no longer, so after some research, I purchased one of these models. This was several years ago, and when something went wrong with it, while still under warranty, they told me to send in the whole machine, at my expense, and THEY would decide if it deserves replacement. It, did, so they sent a replacement to me. This machine is now about two years old, and the only problem I have is with the gasket inside the head, so the machine will drip water (or coffee, if you have the filter on) while the machine is heating. I called the company, but they do not sell parts, but offered me a second machine at a lower price, about $ 70. This THIRD machine lasted about 2 months before a fusible link in one of the thermostats went bad. This meant that the green light is automatically on, immediately when turning on the machine, because the machine thinks it is already hot. When I called the company THIS time, all I had to do was cut the cord at the base, send that in, again at my expense, and they sent a new machine to me. This FOURTH machine leaked as soon as I tried to fill the reservoir. I knew there was just a loose hose or something else similar, but the company said if I unscrew the bottom to look, I void all warranty. \"Just cut the cord at the base...\" This time I told them, I did not want a replacement EC155, and asked for the next model up, and they sent the BAR 32 as a replacement. I then unscrewed the bottom of the fourth machine and the problem was indeed only a cut in the water line. I spent 50 cents to replace that from the local hardware store, a couple of dollars for the fusible link on the third machine, and about 5 dollars for extra cord and plugs to replace the original cords I had to mail in. I now have 3 of these machines, and all three work. HOWEVER! These two newer EC 155's have not seen much use. The filter holder does not fit into the head well, because it is an extremely tight fit, and I don't wish to break the machine. (I believe it is another gasket issue, because the filter holder fits into the older machine easily.) Also, the frothing wand does not stay in one place,but swings back, as if spring-loaded, under the base. This makes it harder to operate, because you either do not move the frothing pitcher (which is unreasonable, because it will not heat the milk in a consistent manner) or you have to have a non-heat sensitive utensile to hold the wand in place while you froth the milk. My issue is that these machines are now made in China, and the workmanship (rather, lack thereof) shows. The company is well aware of this, because they now only ask for a cut cord instead of the whole machine for them to decide if it warrants sending out a new one. They sent a new machine to me instead of allowing me to replace a 50 cent, 6-inch piece of tubing. Also, their own website lists these machines at about $ 80 now, so they did come down in price as well, because my first one was well over $ 100. As a pump machine, they are worth $ 80, but not any more than that. Their customer service is good, but you should not have to wait 3 - 4 weeks for mail turn-around, and you shouldn't have to use warranty in the first place, as any good machine should last longer than 6 months.

After just two months this machine completely stopped heating. Since it was too late for the Amazon return window I had to go through delonghi for the replacement. It's sort of a tedious process and after waiting two weeks already I emailed to follow up and found out there is another thing I need to mail them, which I was never told. Their service reps are very nice on the phone but I'm looking at nearly a month without a machine before I can expect the replacement. At five bucks a day for coffee shop coffees this will quickly add up to the cost of a whole new machine. I don't recommend this machine.",

These machines do not have a volume measurement, so the extract volume must be determined by stopping the pump after the desired amount of coffee extract is produced. I normally use a glass coffee carafe with level indication to catch the desired amount. This carafe is lower than a coffee cup (85 mm) and comfortably fits below the drip mozzles of the older De'Longhi.

We have very high quality water with very few minerals and then filtered again through the refrigerator. My assumption is that DeLonghi is using a different pump over the last couple of years with limited life. Unfortunately, when looking at all the other reviews for other machines, none get good reviews for reliability and often cost $100 - $500 for anything reasonably affordable for home use. It's more cost effective to buy a DeLonghi every 7 or so months than spend lots more money and just get more of the same poor performance.",

Now it's just a loud-vibrating brick :-( Before you purchase this machine consider the following: - The machine is loud (even when it was new) - It vibrates so much the cups underneath move from underneath the espresso dispenser so you must watch them at all times. - It's hard to fit any cups underneath it. My shot glasses barely fit. - The built-in tamp is nice - The water level view is nice - The steamer is in an inconvenient place for use. You must move the machine around to use it with bigger cups. - The shots aren't as strong (I like really strong shots, I needed at least 4 from this machine). - It's slow when dispensing espresso. In short: I was disappointed that this machine didn't live up to my expectations. The price was right, but I felt the quality was below average.

If you want espresso you have to wait 15 minutes to pre-heat THEN you can start the espresso making process. Basically, it should have come with container necessary to froth and it should have clearly stated- \"always have a spare 15 minutes to make your coffee. The coffee dispenser clearance is also on the low side but not as bad as the espresso and frothier.",

There is a number of downsides, but at $300 less than the next step up, it was the clear choice. The pressurized portafilter does a pretty good job at getting good espresso out of a not-so-perfect grind. There are a few downsides, but you cant really complain for the price. 1. Small boiler. I would have to pause 3-4 times when steaming a few ounces of milk to prevent the frother from spraying water. The steam wand is pretty bad.. I could never get real microfoam with it. It heats the milk.. but not much else. (but hey its $100). 2. Heats slowly, making more than two shots at a time without a pause can get tricky. You have to time it right. Like any machine, you kinda have to adjust your technique to match the speed of the boiler and the way everything works. THE BIGGEST DOWNSIDE OF ALL: Mine died after 6 months. Probably because of a calcification issue, but still. I expected better. If you get this machine (which you probably should if you only have $100 and want decent espresso), GET THE WARRANTY. And decalcify it regularly. If you can afford it, save up for a $400-$600 machine. The investment will probably be worth it, especially if this one dies on you.",

We have never owned an espresso machine before, but this looked like a good option based on the price and mostly-positive reviews. Unfortunately, just after the 30 day return period ended, the machine gave up on him. It stopped producing the necessary pressure to put water through the grounds. He tried cleaning with Citric Acid, even though we don't have particularly hard water and it was well before the recommended cleaning schedule. Very little improvement. He called the company and was walked through some procedures to try to get it working again with no luck. Finally was told to cut the cord and mail that (not the whole machine) back to them for a replacement. They wanted to charge $15 to mail a new machine to him, but he when he objected they put him on hold for a few minutes, then came back and said they'd waive that fee. Seems sort of ridiculous to even suggest that a product replacement should have to be paid for when the product is still under warranty! He was happy with the performance of the machine until it gave out, but I just can't give it more than 1 star, even with the replacement on the way, if it's going to fail after one month of 2-3 times daily use. Guess we should have paid more attention to the previous negative reviews. Wonder how long the replacement will last. Once we run out of free replacement options, we'll upgrade to a better product. Edit: 12/13/13 Just wanted to come back and note that the replacement machine that was shipped to us has worked just fine and held up ever since. Hubby is still enjoying his cup of espresso daily. I'm not updating the star rating since I don't want to give the false impression that this machine can be trusted by all, but when it's functional he's happy with it.",

                "review_text": "This is not an automatic machine. You need to think of it as an experience. This machine is the polar opposite of the kind where you set a timer the night before and wake up to coffee. You need to be ok having a relationship with it. Otherwise you will find your morning pretty stressful. This review includes the collective wisdom I've culled from reading hundreds of reviews (seriously, who has time?) as well as my own discoveries. 1. As several reviewers have noted when I posed the question, there is no automatic turn-off. Coffee will keep on coming out until you stop it. Know this and you will avoid the \"I Love Lucy\" effect, I.e., coffee pouring all over your kitchen counter. Either measure into demitasse cups and stop it, or get to know your cappuccino cup size and stop it. The key point is: stop it. 2. The milk frother is, as everyone has noted, very low. To solve this, Amazon is pairing the machine with a tiny frother, described by one reviewer as \"Alice in Wonderland\" size. Here's the nice big but squat one I bought: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y8UCCY/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. That is the Krups Sx5020, 20 ounces. Works like a charm. In a tiny apartment works great for me to store it in the freezer, a move that apparently helps with creating froth. 3. If you are making cappuccino in one of those lovely, comforting soup-bowl-size cups, you haven't a prayer of getting that baby out from under the machine without spilling coffee all over the place. One reviewer suggested removing the metal tray and putting a paper towel in the base instead. Works great! Thank you. Ok so those are the things that were driving me crazy after making the switch to the Delonghi from a French press plus Aerolatte. Do these things and your morning will be sane. Honestly I had no complaints about the French press and if I am making coffee for more than 2 people I will definitely return to it, since we each have a doppio in our cappuccino and turning them out individually for a crowd sounds like becoming a professional barista. (I already have a job.). When the price comes down on the semiautomatics I will be first in line.",

The people who say water isn't coming out either need to wait for the pump to charge the lines which takes a minute or so when it is new/dry, or seat the tank and portafilter properly. My beef is that the boiler is too small and can't maintain temperature consistently. Sometimes you can pull a whole shot, but most of the time it's slightly more than lukewarm. This happens even when the machine is preheated. The OK light turns out whenever it feels like it while you're pulling the shot. In my opinion, proper water temperature is a big deal so I'm not too pleased with that, thus 3 stars.",

The espresso machine that I'm purchasing is replacing one that I've had for about 25 years, so sadly, this is very emotional time for me. :-) But seriously, there are some things about this machine that are very frustrating so here they are. Someone has taken a simple process and made it complicated. You shouldn't have to take 15 minutes to simply start the machine in order to prepare for an espresso. Despite the instructions telling you so, this was not necessary. After all, who wants to wait 15 minutes for the machine to warm up after waking up for their cup of coffee. The filter comes in two sizes, so unfortunately, you have to make coffee to the strength that these filters will allow. Even their larger filter size was unsatisfactory for a very strong cup of espresso or cappuccino or latte. For some strange reason or another, the filter has to be aligned perfectly within the filter holder. You can't just drop it in. This design seems pointless and only takes more time. I did not like the frothing plastic piece because it required you to take it off each time to clean the milk out that got trapped inside. You could not just simply wipe it off. After removing the filter you're guaranteed to get additional coffee dripping down onto the pan. Yes it's removable but who want to take another step out to clean this as well? There is very little space under the area where the coffee is dispensed and if you do not have a very short container or demi tase cup, forget it. My wife got tired of hearing me complaining and insisted that I return it. After exchanging this product for a basic model that cost $45 less , I am back to making my coffee shots in less than 4 minutes with very little cleaning (I love Amazon, so thanks for making this such an easy return process). If someone is fine with taking 10 - 20 minutes for a shot of coffee go for it. You may love this machine as a number of reviews clearly state.",

Also, when the \"pour\" function is on, the machine vibrates strongly enough to make the cups move out of place, spilling coffee. I found that by putting a paper towel underneath the cups, they stay put. The distance between the bottom of the spouts and the base is pretty short, so a normal 6 oz cup doesn't fit. I had to buy espresso cups, since none of the many types of cups in my kitchen fit, which a bit annoying. I've had it for a few months and so far, no signs of blowing up like other reviewers experienced. The instructions say to let the water \"perk\" for 15 mins before moving the dial to pour, but the green light comes on after only a few and it doesn't seem to make any difference with the quality of the coffee.",

But the more glaring problem I'm having is that no water is being dispensed. Looking through the book, it advised me of a few things: 1 - There was no water in the filter. (There is) 2 - The filter is installed incorrectly. (I poured the water out, put the tank back in to make sure the filter was open, it was. I refilled the tank and put it back, the filter was still open) 3 - There was a blockage. (I haven't used it yet? I'm not quite sure what could be blocking the water from even trying to come out?) If anyone has any pointers, I would really appreciate it. I'm a newbie to this, which is why I went with this model and brand, but I'm debating about returning it if I can't get any water out.

Firstly, I didn't realize how tiny it was so no coffee carafe will fit under the coffee spout and only very tiny traditional espresso cups will fit. Not awesome as I'm not about to go out and buy espresso cups. The steam arm is rather short so for steaming a large amount of milk it's kind of a pain. It's doing the job okay. I can only compare it to a product that most coffee afficionados cringe at hearing about so I'm not sure if this review would be useful to any coffee snobs. For those of you just looking for an easy to make espresso and steaming milk, maybe stick to the \"steam toys.\" It's annoying to have to preheat this unit just for a cup of coffee as I'm making a latte rushing out the door in the a.m. but it does an okay job.",

I'll upgrade to something nicer when this inevitably craps out, if I see myself using this often enough to justify spending the money for a nicer one. Update: pump isn't strong enough to push water through finer espresso grounds. Steamer attachment is pretty worthless because you can only steam milk for about 10 seconds at a time.

I bought this machine to have the convenience of espresso-making at home, and overall, it does what it has to do: makes great-tasting espressos at a reasonable price.

First, when it is making espresso, it vibrates rather hard and loud, making it hard for me to make espressos while my people in my apartment are sleeping, as well as causing the small espresso cup to move out of place. So you have to hold the little espresso cup in place or you'll have the espresso drip miss its mark. Second, the machine drips on well after it's been turned off, which gets a bit messy. All in all, the annoyances are not such a big deal, but I would have spent some extra money to get a machine that doesn't drip past the shut off point and doesn't vibrate so darn much and so loud. UPDATE @ 10 months: This machine is a dud. I didn't even make 25 cups of espresso through it over a 10 month period and it has simply stopped pumping, even after I cleaned different parts out. The buyer shouldn't have to take this to maintenance after such modest use and so soon. Set your sights elsewhere, even if you have to pay more.",

It seemed to have only one real drawback - the frothing element was too low - difficulty in removing foamed milk container - this is true, but I can live with that. I still like the machine, but I had problems with the frother leaking water during the brewing cycle. It got so bad, I had to put a cup under the frother to catch the water - I would get a full cup od water by the time I got a cup of esspresso. I contacted amazon.com (very helpful) and they asked that I contact the company - so I did. The company gave me the run around - had me do all this stuff with descalling, etc. After 4 weeks of e-mails back and forth and a threat that I would contact amazon.com, I asked that they replace the pump - it was on warranty. I followed their instructions, sent them $15.00 (why? I do not know) and they sent me a new pump. After about 3 weeks of operation with the replacement pump, I have the same problem - a leaky frother. The leak is not nealy as bad as the first pump - just a few drops, maybe a teaspoon. I will continue to use the pump, because it does produce a great espresso and cappuccino - I simply put a espresso cup under the frother during brewing. However, 2 things that truly rub me the wrong way 1) the time it took to replace the malfunctioning machine and 2) the run around I got from the company - plus sending an additional $15.00 for a warrantied product - I guess that's 3 things.

I couldn't figure out where the water came from. The outside of the box wasn't wet. Then I read the instructions. It is normal for water to stay in the bottom of the machine. Since when can this be normal, I wondered. I followed the directions about cleaning the machine by running it without coffee. When I did make coffee, the coffee was awful. The plastic water tank may be a factor in the terrible taste of the water. Although I had washed the water tank a few times with soap and water, it still smelled of plastic. In addition, the steamer nozzle dripped water. The steam was also not sufficient and strong enough to froth milk. I had a Krups that produced a wonderful froth. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a replacement part for that Krups so I had to buy a new machine. Fortunately, I was able to return this machine to Amazon.",

                "review_text": "The issues I have with the appliance are #1. it seems to make weak espresso, watery, so I have to add about three or four shots to make a decent cup of cappuccino. #2. hot water squirts out of the frother for a really long time before it becomes steamy so don't put your milk under it until you know it's actually shooting steam or your milk is also watery. #3 you have to carefully watch while the coffee is coming out because it just keeps running until you stop it and if you get distracted it runs over and gets everywhere. #4. you have to make sure the cup or cups are centered on a very small area or the stream of coffee will not go into the cup and since the vibration of the machine makes the cup move you have to stand there and watch it and keep moving it back into place. #5. It doesn't come with the cups and the area is shallow so I had to buy three different sets to find one that actually fits underneath. #6. The thing that holds the coffee grounds really holds them! You have to bang and bang it against the trash can to get them to come out or dig them out with a spoon and it makes a big mess. #7 all of this takes about 5-10 minutes just to get one cappuccino....so if you are buying it because it has two spouts, it doesn't much matter. You will need both shots and probably a couple more to make one good cup. If you want two you better set aside a big block of time for that. #8 It is expensive by the time you buy all the other things you need to actually use it, the frothing cup, the espresso cups and a lot of beans just to make one cappuccino. The good things are that it has a swivel arm for the frother so you can hold it over the sink while it shoots water out of it and that prevents the counter from flooding. The reservoir where all your coffee goes if you don't stand there watching it is removable so easy to clean. It looks nice.",

                "review_text": "This was my first entry into making espresso at home. This machine is cheap, but has too many drawbacks in its design, which negate it being inexpensive. Several that De'Longhi could have avoided due to its size. On top of these, my unit leaked water so I had to return it. I really wanted to like this and the price point was great, but it just wasn't worth the struggle. I'm not sure what a suitable alternative in a similar price range would be. 1. The steam wand: let's out too much water. It takes like 10 seconds to purge and it never completely purges, it constantly spurts out bits of water instead of pure steam. I suspect it's not getting hot enough. 2. The wand is too short and sits too low. You can either lift the machine on a stand to make up for sitting too low, but there's nothing you can do to extend the length of the wand. You would either need to use a tiny frothing pitcher (and risk making a mess each time) or put too much milk in the pitcher to reach the wand. Combine that with the steam problem on the wand and you're going to end up with too much milk and not enough control. 3. The tamper is just a little plastic piece off to the side. It's works, but a handheld tamper would be much better, but the real problem is that it's slightly too small for the grounds basket. Why couldn't De'Longhi make this large enough to be a perfect fit for their own unit? 4. The portafilter sits very low in the machine as well, so you are limited to using very tiny cups or first pulling into shot glasses. I didn't have tiny cups that fit, so I used shot glasses. But the unit rattles so much as you're pulling a shot that you have to closely monitor, else the unit will rattle so much that it causes the shot glass to move off to the side and completely miss the espresso pouring down.",

Let's start with the most important thing and that is the taste. My first cup came out really good. I'm very happy with the overall look and taste of the cup. The point was to replace my regular Starbucks habit and this cup would indicate I'm well on my way. That said there are a few quirks with this machine that I didn't seem to read in other reviews. 1. The space to put your espresso glasses to collect the espresso is extremely small. You'll definitely need to buy some small \"shot\" style espresso glasses to fit in here. 2. When you turn the machine on to operate it, it vibrates EXCESSIVELY. So much so it has me wondering if my machine is defective. I literally have to hold my Espresso glasses in place to prevent them from moving out from under the filter when it's running. And it's VERY noisy. 3. The manual recommends that you \"warm up\" the machine for 15-30 minutes before making your Espresso. So if you plan to use this every morning before work, you're going to have to plan accordingly. 4. The milk frother is quite short. You're going to need a relatively small and shallow frother. Even with one that is pretty small, getting it on and off the frothing utensil is a challenge, especially when it's hot. All this said, I'm still happy with my purchase because the cup of Cappuccino tasted great and I think the price of the machine is pretty good, especially if you're a prime member. Good luck!",

                "review_text": "I bought this espresso machine as a gift for 2 people and they absolutely loved it, so when my coffee pot broke, I thought I'd give it a try. The box arrived and the packaging was subpar. Basically it was a box inside of a box, no added fluff. And the outside box was ripped and torn. Once I got the machine out of the box, I noticed water droplets everywhere. I took the clear plastic off and noticed water all over the side and dripping on the floor. I gently shook the machine and could hear water swooshing around. When I looked in the reservoir there was no water in there -- just the packaged accessories as though it was new. I could not for the life of me figure out where the water was coming from. I opened up the bag that was sealed which had the manual and warranty info in it to see if it mentioned anything about a pre-filled machine, but couldn't find anything. So, I packed it back up and sent in a request for a replacement. I don't know how I'm supposed to send it back since the box that Amazon sent it in is not reusable. I thought Amazon improved their packaging, but now I'm thinking not so much. Who knows if it was a return that should of not went back on the \"shelf\", or if it was in fact a lemon direct from the manufacturer? I'm willing to give it another try, but my gosh what a hassle. Hoping Amazon handles this situation promptly and appropriately. Once I get the machine up and running and use it a few times, I will update my review. Updating 10/26/12: I've been using this machine daily for a few months now. About a week ago it started going out on me. It would do a few shots fine, but then the pump would not give the pressure needed. I called the manufacturer today and it still under warranty. They want me to try descaling it first though. So, off to go buy descaler (a good thing to have w/ any coffee maker probably), and if that doesn't work, then I will be sending it in for repair. I make about 2-3 drinks a day with it. When it worked, it worked fabulous. Paid for itself w/in a couple weeks. For this reason, I've upped it to 3 stars. Only 3 because I truly believe the pump to be broken (rather than a descaling issue), and at just a few months of use, that is not acceptable. I will update again after I descale.",

I got good crema when using good espresso coffee and had no problem with tamping or any of the other things I saw commented on in the reviews. My happiness lasted only three months and then the other issue I saw repeated again and again in the reviews occurred. The pressure stopped and I got my coffee one drip at time. First noticeable problem was that it kept hissing if left on - a seal problem I assume - then it blew coffee grounds all over the place as I released the handle one day and then, nothing. And before anyone asks, yes I cleaned it, pumped it out and all other recommended fixes to no avail. The milk still steamed but the coffee trickled. All that said, Amazon refunded my money and I have enough faith in the brand that I bought another De'Longhi which is again producing good coffee.",

What I didn't like about the machine is that it is excessively noisy, a bit awkward and clumsy and the whole unit vibrates to the point that you have to watch that your cup does not move from directly beneath the espresso port, speaking of which, sits too low to be able to put a standard size cup or caf\u00e9 receptacle (with a wider opening than an espresso cup) beneath it. The milk frother also sits too low to be able to froth a coffee mug of milk directly. I had to use a wide mouth frothing pitcher tilted sideways and the wand still didn't reach to the milk as far as I wanted. I also had to go back and make a second espresso after using the \"two shot\" screen, as the two shots were really only equal to one for me and my cappo was weak, although I use a good, imported Italian coffee (Lavazza). I will comment that my personal preference and standards for espresso and cappos are high because I drink them daily after living in Italy for three years. I have since been using an inexpensive Krups steam driven machine which we bought back in the 1990s (which says a lot for that machine as long as you get one with a separate setting for steam and coffee and you know how to manipulate the machine beyond the standard instructions). We have used it off and on throughout the years as we have spent much time living overseas, so it was put up during that time and we had to use a local machine for local electricity. However, as much as we have used the heck out the Krups, my husband and I have long wanted to upgrade to a pump driven machine. The DeLonghi is a good machine for the price if you are basically a weekend or occasional espresso/cappuccino drinker, or want to be the barista for friends while entertaining. I think if I got used to the machine on my daily basis it might be ok, but I prefer to eliminate the design and functional issues by finding a better machine.",

But the replacement machine, simply doesn't work anywhere as as well as the three year old machine, its just got a wimpy pump. ( i'd give the old machine 4 star, but the new one only 1.)

If you don't hold the cup, it will vibrate right off the machine when you are trying to make the espresso. ( This could be something wrong with the unit ) 2: The tamper ( the press you use on the coffee or espresso grinds ) is attached to the unit, it can't be removed from what I can see. This is just stupid and creates a huge mess if you try to use it because of its placement. It just makes it difficult to clean and get grinds everywhere if you use it. I have my old one from my last machine and am just using that. 3: The steamer is very low to the counter. You would almost have to put this machine up on something to get a coffee cup under it. The arm is also very very short and it's difficult to really get a good froth out of it. I had to get a small tea cup to froth the milk and I pour that into my coffee cup and then the espresso I made. So it takes 3 cups to make one drink. Silly. 4: I have had some issues with this leaking a little espresso. I made sure there was nothing blocking the rim, there grinds where not too high to get a good seal and it was in nice and tight. What I like: 1: The water pitcher is inside the unit and pulls out easily with a handle. Easy refill! Great. 2: This unit seems to heat up rather quickly. Thats all I got on the likes. ____ So Frustrated with this unit. Was really missing my espressos when my last unit broke. I'm thinking I will have to continue my hunt and end up spending a lot more money on a unit to get something better. I hoping this would be a good machine. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles.

I read multiple reviews on the De'Longhi, and decided to purchase it, primarily because it seemed to be the best \"budget\" model available. That said, I have been underwhelmed, though not totally surprised. Per other reviewers commentary, it is somewhat cumbersome to use if you want to make multiple shots of coffee. I like my coffee very strong and dark, and use french roast beans (the same that were used in my Krups machine). Unfortunately, I'm not able to replicate the strength and taste with this machine. It seems weaker, even when I take the time to change out the coffee for multiple shots. In addition, though not a deal breaker, it is very noisy, and has a significant vibration when the pump is engaged. There is probably another machine that would meet my needs, albeit for a much greater cash expenditure. Therefore, I'll likely try a french press next, and continue to use the De'Longhi, but rarely.",

I drink up to 20 cups of espresso daily (yes, I do), so this is no small thing. My last Saeco ended up making crummy coffee with wonderful beans. But this machine does not fit right on my counter, in my limited space, which all other espresso makers have done. The steamer is on the left, the basket fits from the left, rather than the center. I usually heat milk in the microwave, so I don't actually need to use that space or remove the steam wand for cleaning. But, it is hard to place on the counter & hard to place my grinder on the counter, too: it is in the way, on either side, or behind. This is also as light as a toy & skips toward me when expressing coffee. I must keep pushing the cup back under the spigot. The booklet shows little cups warming on the top & I shudder to think how many would end in shards. I do not expect it to last a long time. I'm betting on a year at the outside. But it's easy to use & makes nice coffee. The problem is all in the design.",

                "review_text": "I no longer recommend buying this machine. I've recorded my experience with this model in the paragraphs below in reverse chronology. If you read the 1-star reviews on this machine you will see that many of them are rated so due to pump failure. Of the total reviews a full 30% are rated 1-star. Update 2-13-2015: The machine purchased on 5-30-14 has failed in less than one year. I have complained to Amazon about the consistent poor quality of the pumps in this model and suggested they stop selling it. DeLonghi has offered to honor the 1-year warranty, but I would rather have a refund so that I can move on and purchase a different brand. Out of 5 machines purchased in the past 4 years, 4 have had failed pumps. Even though all but one of them essentially paid for itself before crashing,I will not purchase another one because it's become a hassle to have to return it each and every time. Despite having one machine tha t was operational for 4 years, the other 4 died of the same cause...failed pump. I'm changing my rating to 1 star because DeLonghi continues to offer this machine in light of the known fact that the pump is not reliable. They need to up their manufacturing standards. Update 5-30-2014: The machine purchased last March 2013 has failed. Again, it was the pump which has given out. I had purchased a Fair Trade Warranty, so will get refunded for the purchase price. With the money I'm buying another DeLonghi, same model. Doing the math, I figure that if I purchased a latte every day (I do drink at least one a day, sometimes two) my grande latte would cost me a minimum of $3.50 a day at my local coffee shack or $4.35 a day at Starbucks. Making my own at home costs $1.36 a day and that's with organic milk and a K-cup pod of pre-measured coffee. At the least, I am saving $781 a year by making my own with this machine. Even if I have to replace it annually at a cost of $99, plus tax, I am still money ahead. Again, this machine makes delicious lattes when it's working properly! Still 5 stars! Others have written extensive reviews on this espresso maker that I relied on to make my initial purchase. I made my original purchase in 2010. I took that machine to my office so I could make lattes there, and 3 years later it's still working. I bought a second one to use at home which stopped pumping after 18 months. As the warranty had expired, I threw it away and bought a replacement. That machine was a lemon and I sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement (same machine). The replacement works perfectly and this time I bought Square Trade warranty (about $20 for a 3-year warranty on small kitchen appliances). This machine is not perfect, but it makes delicious lattes and has paid for itself many times over again. I'll keep buying the for as long as De'Longhi makes it!",

As an update.....I've now had this product almost a year. The steamer has quit working well and the unit drips. It rattles VERY badly when brewing. I have contacted customer service and, after a lot of run around, they are sending me a new one (as soon as I cut the power cord off this one and send it in). Their customer service is friendly enough but they take FOREVER to resolve issues.

                "review_text": "Pretty disappointed with this product especially w/the rave reviews: As stated previously, there's no room to put a cup under the spout. The directions state to dry the bottom of the unit out to get rid of the standing water occasionally - No way to do that w/o turning the unit upside down for a while and letting the water drain out of the quarter size hole that opens into the heating chamber. The big thing is the quality of the espresso - I found it weak - This is after running 5 batches of water sans espresso through it as required by the directions to get it clean enough to make espresso. The directions admonish the user to use just the right amount of tamping for the perfect brew so I made the 1st cup w/light tamping and it came out pretty weak - This is using the recommended Lavazza espresso - Rechecked directions to make sure I wasn't missing a step - Good to go - So batch # 2 I tamped pretty hard - The unit had no problem pushing the steam through but the result was about the same. I pressed my old Krups steam espresso maker back into service using the same espresso, tamp pressure and water amount and the difference was massive - The espresso was much more full bodied and vibrant tasting - I'm sending the unit back. Thanks Amazon - You're Amazin', Just a word about Amazon - Me thinks most of you weren't around when back in the day Amazon was some wacko \"on line\" (What the heck is \"on line\" ??) book retailer and the creditors were knockin' at the door. They really are a company that's earned their status in the world of on line retailing - they ARE the reason we have on line retailing today and I just want to give them a shout out and say thanks for world class customer service.",

I'm saving up for a better machine. It worked well when it worked. My darling husband purchased this machine for my birthday in November. He did a ton of research and this was the best machine for the price. I love this machine. I've been spending too much money in coffee shops for espresso and now, we use it every day. It is easy to use (especially with ESE pods), easy to clean and makes delicious. I would suggest buying a tamper (the delonghi plastic tamper is stuck onto the machine) Espresso Tamper 50 & 60 Mm Sizes Cast Alloy Hand Coffee . Also, I was able to find a small milk frothing pitcher Stainless Steel 10oz. Steaming & Frothing Pitcher on Amazon which made a big difference for me with being able to froth milk etc. We also got a ESE pod sampler Espressotiamo Grand Sampler 72 ESE espresso pods which allowed us to try 30 different espresso pods. Now we just order our favorites. I don't know if I'll ever become the sort of espresso drinker who has a $400 burr grinder and a $400 machine but I love having fresh, amazing espresso every morning. I am able to make a better espresso drink than 75% of the cafes out there, and I live in Portland, Oregon, the american home of good coffee.",

The EC155 arrived and the first irritating thing was standing water in the inlet under the tank. Testing purpose? Refurbished? Doesn't matter, I do not like water in a brand new machine. Then I spent an hour to figure out why in the world the machine would not deliver water through the boiler outlet. Yep, I let it sit with full tank for an hour and more, green light indicated it's ready. The boiler outlet is bone dry. The steamer works fine and delivers steam. There is sufficient heat and pressure. Apparently the pump is clogged or one of the two temp sensors is not working. I assume this machine uses separate valves that are controlled by two separate temp sensors (2 temp sensors according to manual). I really hoped I'd love this one too, but DOA with water in the machine? Extremely disappointed. I actually go so far and think that this was returned (standing water at inlet) and they never bothered to check why, and just repackaged it. Returning is the only option. Reading other negative reviews I rather try to get something similar at the local store next time. Update: well, after not being able to find anything decent at a similar price I decided to change refund to replacement. Replacement shipped within two days, thanks Amazon. The machine works great just like my older EC140B. Giving it 4stars and hope it lasts as long as the old one. Great espresso, cappuccino or cafe au lait - can't beat the price. Update Oct-23 2012, 1.5 years later the pump is finally giving up. On the other hand the cheaper model I purchased from Newegg is still making great Espressos at work. Now it's really time for another brand. At $80 giving good Espressos for 18 months isn't too bad I guess. I therefore have to give it a mediocre rating.",

                "review_text": "I just updated my review, 12/6/2011. ORIGINAL REVIEW =============== I just got this 2 days ago. I drink two lattes a day, so I get regular use of it. Previously I used a Mr Coffee steam espresso maker. I didn't like the metal-alloy boiler in the Mr Coffee machine. The metal visibly deteriorates over time (2+ yr), so I am consuming whatever it is made of and I don't like the idea of that. For the price, this machine is a GREAT value. It makes real espresso, something the steam type makers don't seem capable of. Pros: -Price -Great Espresso -Great frother -Pumped, not steamed -Stainless steel boiler The only significant negative on this machine is that the space where the coffee comes out is RIDICULOUSLY! short. I have little espesso cups and they won't fit under it. I bought two shot glasses at Kroger that looked pretty standard to me. They are about 1/4 inch too tall. I am still looking for the right cups. Don't hesitate to buy this machine, but if you do you will want a couple of shot glasses that are about 2 1/2\" tall, maybe even slightly less. UPDATE 11/14/2011 ================= I have experienced quality issues with the machine. Water started coming through the coffee basket whenever the heat was turned on, preheat and steam modes. It is not enough to make it unusable, but is a significant amount. I contacted Delonghi support and they are replacing it, but what a hassle. I have to cut the cord off and mail the cord to them, with a $15 check. The worse part is, I can no longer use the old machine, so... Not sure I'd buy again if I knew it would be this poor quality. As a result, I changed my rating from 4 stars to 3. UPDATE 12/6/2011 ================ I got the new macine via mail on 12/3. After a couple weeks of waiting for the replacement, I checked to see if my check had cleared. It had cleared about a week earlier, so I sent an e-mail to DeLonghi asking when I was going to receive the replacement, noting that I knew my check had cleared. I don't know if it is coincidence or not, but the replacement shipped the same day I sent the e-mail. Hmmm. So, if you have warranty issues with this machine, it will cost you about $20 to get it replaced under warranty (their $15 fee, and postage to return the cord to them). You will be without your machine for three weeks (per my experience). Maybe it is not worth the hassle. I do still enjoy the espresso it makes.",

The frothing wand is almost useless unless you use a very short vessel for the milk. The machine is noisy and vibrates terribly. Water tank is too small if making multiple cappuccinos. It went back by day three. I replaced with a Melitta model: 40791, which Amazon also sells, you can see my review of it I just finished. The Mellita is FAR FAR superior to the De'Longhi for a variety of reasons: higher wattage, long frothing wand, quiet, heavier, LARGE exterior water tank - a better quality machine all around. The only thing I didn't care for on the Melitta was the tamper, it was plastic but most machines don't come with a good tamper so I wasn't surprised. I purchased a $15 stainless steel tamp from Amazon as well.",

By then we were out of warranty, so it would've cost more than it was worth to repair it. The second one(exact same model) we bought at a local Target, and it only made it 6 months! The problem with the second one is that boiler seems unable to maintain enough pressure to push water through the coffee grounds. We ONLY ever used distilled water, and cleaned all parts and reservoir with espresso machine cleaner! I was able to get another week of use out of the second one after spending over 2 hours running cleaning and then rinsing cycles through the boiler, but now it's stopped working again.

Other reviewers have covered its strengths and weaknesses very well. Over the last several months, however, it started leaking more and more severely. Water began pooling on the counter under the machine, at first intermittently, later after every use. Eventually water began to drip from the plastic case around the group head (not through the group head). I figured I would need to replace the machine, but I thought I'd try to open it up and see if it could be repaired easily. I'm sharing my experience here in case it might help anyone else, but should you follow these instructions you do so AT YOUR OWN RISK and please BE CAREFUL! To open the machine, I removed the four screws holding the top panel, two from under the cover and two from under the front edge; I also loosened the steam control knob and used a knife to pry it up and off the machine. The top panel and rear cover can then be removed. Turning on the pump, I immediately noticed water dripping and squirting out of the connection between the boiler unit and the hose coming from the pump unit. The hose is held on with a small clip, easily removed with needle-nose pliers. Removing the hose revealed a small o-ring on the end. (The o-ring might not come out with the hose, in which case you'll need to use tweezers (or something similar) to remove it from the boiler connection point.) On closer examination I could see that the o-ring had split and failed. Some searching online showed that I needed DeLonghi replacement part number 5313217701, which I ordered at minimal expense. Upon receiving the replacement o-ring, I slipped it over the end of the hose and used needle-nose pliers to push the hose + o-ring fully into the connection point; the new o-ring was larger than the old one so it took quite a bit of pressure to seat the hose + o-ring all the way into the connection point, inserting the tip of the pliers into the connection opening to push the hose deeper. Once it was in all the way, I could reattach the clip to hold the hose in place. Turning on the pump, I saw no more leaking and reassembled the machine. It's back to working as well as it ever did! I'm glad I was able to make a cheap repair to the machine, nonetheless the leaks I experienced, and reading similar reports by others, does make me question DeLonghi's reliability. Accordingly, I'm reducing my rating to 3 stars from the 4 star rating I would have given otherwise. I've posted some customer images showing the interior of the machine and the hose with failed o-ring, so please have a look for them.",

Look, if you don't want to spend a lot of money and just want a \"starter\" machine to see if you will use it enough to later buy a solidly made \"Metal\" model, I'd recommend this because let's face it, it's less than the cost of a dinner date. But I have 2 friends with \"Metal\" and solid expresso machines and this one felt and looked cheap compared to theirs. For instance, the handle that you put the expresso into, did not fit smoothly or properly twist into place (as my friends models do). Now the \"solid\" machines will run you $300 - $500 (minimum), so it is not a bad idea to buy a machine like this to see it you would use it enough to justify a larger investment (kind of like buying a Kindle Fire before buying an iPad). So although my initial experience was not good, I do see this machine as being the right choice for a large number of people. Let's face it, we all have received or purchased small appliances (Juicer anyone? Bread Maker? Rice Cooker? Pasta Maker? Slow Cooker?) that we end up never using!",

At around two years the coffee maker stopped working but the cappuccino maker side of the machine kept going strong. We replaced the coffee maker a long time ago but had this giant machine with only one component working on our counter. We decided to go with another De'Longhi for the espresso maker. The components are all similar to the previous one we had, all except the frother that is. The wand on our other machine was long and slender and came off very easily, whereas the one on this system is short and wide and needs to be unscrewed. We have tried daily for two weeks to get the frother to work thinking it may be operator error. We have called the mfg. and checked youtube to see if there is something we should or shouldn't be doing. The closest I have come is a little bit of foam but mostly it's a latte. Also this machine gets way too hot when frothing the milk, the milk starts to boil which the mfg. said they never hear of, the always hear that the milk stays cold. Since we've seen people produce foam on youtube our consensus is that we got a lemon and just got a faulty one. I had no issues at all with the espresso portion of the machine. The tamper really isn't the best, but I've used the same tamper on my old system so I've figured out how to use this over the years and get great espresso w/creama. As other reviewers have said, the espresso you buy really is essential. I have no issues with that aspect of the system, but I do not want to buy a separate frother for cappuccinos.",

Apparently there was some air trapped in the system that caused it to run loudly. That worked itself out after about 15 shots and now the sound is a simple buzz as it should be. Also I can now fully move the handle to the correct position where I get the optimum pressure. I'm guessing it took a while for this part to get broken in to where the gasket could be fully compressed. I'm still not 100% happy with the short steam tube, but I've gotten a larger 20 oz frothing cup and this allows me to tilt it 45 degrees and not worry about spilling any milk. If I could, I would rate this at 4 stars, with one star off for the unit arriving with a broken lid hinge. Original review: I received what appeared to be a new unit, although it had residual water inside of it. Perhaps the boiler was tested before leaving the factory. The top cover was broken at the hinge, so it can't be flipped back, but it comes off completely. There is no way to fix this. I suspect that every unit will have a broken lid in a matter of weeks. The hinge is poorly designed with two 1 mm long nibs holding the heavy lid on. Once one of the nibs breaks off, the lid won't stay on at the hinge. The filter holder does not fit tightly enough unless you put on so much force that you think you are going to break the machine. If you don't force it, water will leak down the handle. You need to grasp the coffeemaker tightly with one arm like a football and use your other hand to force on the filter, otherwise the unit will leak. Even with extreme force on the handle, I can't get it to line up the 2 filter outlet holes with the drip basin on the bottom. It also means that if I use 2 cups, I have to align them very carefully at an unusual angle. I am thinking that something was not assembled correctly on this unit, but I didn't bother to look at it carefully to see if it can be fixed/realigned. The machine is very loud. I'm not sure why it is as loud as it is, but you have to yell to talk to someone standing next to you. The frother is poorly designed and will not take a standard sized frothing cup unless you tilt it at an angle so that you can only froth to half the depth of the cup. I also wish the frother was on the opposite side since it gets in the way when trying to lock on the filter cup. In all, I'm disappointed, but then this is a low end machine so you can't expect perfection. The fact that it was broken from out of the box is annoying, but I doubt there is very good quality control at the factory in China and no one wants to pull a unit off the line for a broken hinge. However, I will not buy another DeLonghi product because this is not a good sign of quality. Yes, it does do what it is supposed to do, just with more complications, noise, and mess than one would expect.",

My first thought was that maybe it was actually a used/refurbished model, and they'd tried to pawn it off as new. It was a LOT of water. The box it had come in wasn't damp either, so I doubted that it accumulated during shipping. Basically, the steam wand worked, but no water would come out when I switched the knob to the \"espresso/coffee\" setting to pull the espresso shots. The pump ran and ran, but no water would come out. I am really disappointed. Delonghi was professional about servicing my complaint and offered to send me a new unit as long as I cut the electrical cord from the old one and send it to them as proof, although I must confess I am somewhat skeptical about the quality of the manufacturing.

Several drawbacks, one mentioned in other reviews is the low height (~2 1/2\") of the cup which can be used underneath. I know it's not a coffee maker and is probably designed for a demitasse only. A second drawback is the vibration of the machine when the pump is on. When I first used the machine I could not figure out what all the noise was. Some silverware about 2 feet away on the counter were clanking and the cup on the maker vibrated off the stand. The vibration is most significant before the espresso starts coming from the maker. Need to cushion under the cup. A third drawback was the temperature of the espresso. After thinking the espresso did not seem very hot, I took an instant read digital kitchen thermometer to take temp. With the water coming out directly from the machine without using grounds, the temp barely reached 160F. This does not seem hot enough. Difficult to rate. While espresso was fine, other issues are of an annoyance. Issues, I think, should not be part of a properly designed product.",

First, it does make espresso, it can froth milk. The rattling, noise, and awkward spacing of this machine make that process pretty unenchanting though; I don't really enjoy making my lattes, and to me that's an important part of the process. I wanted to step up from a Mr Coffee to have real espresso, but the cup rattling, fact that I have to remove the bottom plate to awkwardly fit my espresso cup, and shoddy milk frother that is too short, too noisy, and too unreliable make making a latte a fairly unpleasant process. IMO, you're better off going with the cheaper Mr Coffee that doesn't make true espresso or going up for a better espresso maker if you want a real experience. The downsides of this machine don't really make creating a morning latte that enchanting of a ritual. HOWEVER, if all you want is a nice cup of true espresso this is for you.",

While they work, they make GREAT espresso and cappuccino. The price still beats Starbucks or other possibilities. But, make no mistake, the pumps just seem to wear out. I have done all the correct cleaning and care stuff. I do not believe ANY of the reviews stating that their units have lasted for years. The DeLonghi machines do not last. But, I have tried several other brands, and their definition of espresso or cappuccino is not mine. I just ordered another DeLonghi. I guess I could buy the warranty, but it takes WEEKS to send it to their prescribed repair locations...then more WEEKS to get it back, only to find that it still does not work. I have done that.

The plastic nozzle doesn't seal when screwed back into the steaming pipe, causing steam to leak from the upper part of the nozzle. The milk warmed up but didn't double up in size or make foam as it is supposed to do. The purpose of owning this machine is to make a good cappuccino for breakfast, but that is not possible.

There is a method for a quicker cup that involves cycling the unit from the dispense and heat modes multiple times. However, even with the 1/2 wait time, it does not produce enough coffee without reheating for two cafe' cups without going to reheat cycle. (My Keurig can heat a 16 oz cup at a time with no problem.) 2. The unit vibrates when dispensing to the point you must hold the cups in place in order to keep them centered under the dispensing spouts. 3. As noted in other reviews, the foamer is too low for a standard foaming cup. A minor item, but \"just another brick in the wall\". Could not get the milk hot resulting in a luke-warm cappuccino.

The other comments about the tamper are correct, purchasing a seperate tamper is a must - which is minor. The problem is DURABILITY. We make expresso's daily, purchasing our first machine late June 2010. The machine started dripping water from the expresso pod after four months. This is alwasy during the warm up cycle AND while steaming milk. We literally get 3/4's of a shot of expresso from the dripping while steaming milk! The company said to turn it 'off' for 10-15 seconds as this will reset everything. While that sounded great, it did not work - even with it being off for a full minute. They sent us another machine easily and quickly. We received the second machine around Thanksgiving. Not having espresso drip while steaming milk was GREAT! You have no idea how much mess this makes. By mid January it slowly started to drip again! Today, the NEW machine is back to giving another 1/2 shot of expresso while steaming milk! If things continue like the last one, this will only increase. Two machines - same problem with 4 months and 3 months of daily use. I'll call DeLonghi Monday and post a new report next. However, the durability of this machine is simply NOT there. AVOID this product! The mess this makes is ridiculous taking the joy away from pulling shots and steaming milk.",

I went back and read some of the reviews after this happened and noticed there was another review that said the same thing. Yes the water starts leaking and pouring out. The last 2 months that it did work the machine was in a pool of water after each use. I am really bummed because I loved the morning espresso but just pulled out my trusty Krupps coffee maker that I've had for 10 years and I am back to my coffee. I am no longer able to return it as per the return policy. If you buy this machine I would say don't get too use to it because your heart will be broken when it just stops after 5 months into it.

It was at first very quite and fast. The steaming wand did kind of annoy me because it seemed to be in the way of the pulls. Overall, I was happy with it while it lasted but then the pump started to go around the 1 year mark. Espresso started dripping out and no crema. This could be fixed by cleaning the boiler outlet and filters but it happened more frequently, every couple of weeks. It lasted me about 11 months, I used it everyday for at least two double shots but I'm going to go with a different brand at almost triple the price next...",

Also, the manual says to let it heat up for 15 minutes before brewing. I've used it after as little as 5 minutes and it still does fine. But, there are things I really don't like about it. If you buy this machine, here are my tips: 1. Find a cup that is short enough. 2.5-3 inches is all the clearance you have to work with. 2. Have the machine up against a wall. The filter basket can be difficult to put on, and the unit is too light to stay in place when attaching it. Having it against a wall gives you better leverage. 3. Don't let the machine warm up without the basket attached. Doing this makes it much more difficult to attach the basket, making the last issue even more prominent. 4. Don't tamp it too hard. I've found pressing the basket into the tamper that's on the machine, just until you're about to start lifting the unit is enough pressure. If you tamp too hard, you won't get a nice crema... And you may not even get espresso. My last machine was not nearly as picky as this one is. If you can live with the above, then go for it. For the same (or less) money, though, you can get the Mr. Coffee ECMP50, which has none of the above issues, and still makes great espresso.",

Nothing should have broken it during that time and only dust touched on it. I have tried everything like turning on the machine and waiting for the light to turn green for ready then turning it off and on again. I have repeatedly turned the steam knob around, but no steaming noise comes out from the wand. I have gently cleaned the machine and there is also nothing stuck inside like a bug. I have NOT opened apart the machine, but I don't think that is possible? I guess you do get what you paid for, but I am disappointed regardless because almost every review was positive about this! It was just today that I bought overly expensive espresso grounds to start using the machine again but found out that it completely is malfunctioned.

Our work-around was to take off the cover of the drip tray and put a paper towel in the bottom of the tray -- this way we can use more \"normal-sized\" espresso cups. 2-3: the machine itself is extremely light-weight, but the coffee holder is quite solid. It is almost impossible to get the coffee holder to turn into place. It's sheer luck whether I'll get it to turn into place or not. Unfortunately, I'm looking for a new machine.",

I only used deionized water in it so there could be no chance of mineral build up and I never even used it close to the minimum number of times for the first cleaning. Fast forward to November of 2014 and I bought a new grinder and wanted to try out my EC155 again. I warmed the unit up and tried to run some water through the lines to flush any old water out and the water would barely dribble out. I cleaned everything per the manual even though it did not need it and tried to make a shot but the pump was shot and could not push water out. Thank god it had not been a year yet. I emailed customer service, it says they will get back to you in 24 hours, yea right, so I called and sat on hold for almost a half hour and was told to send in my invoice from Amazon. I faxed it that same day and waited to be contacted. I had to email them and call them back and insist that I indeed had faxed it and insist they look for it which they reluctantly did. Finally they gave me instructions to return and sent me a new one. Here's hoping I get more than a couple months use out of this unit but I'm not betting on it.",

This unit must be designed for pods and weaker american style coffee. The 2 cup coffee filter packed to the rim will deliver 4 ozs of e medium strength espresso. I found the key was to only deliver coffee when the green ok light is on. The light will go out after after about 2 ozs are delivered then wait a minute for it to come on before delivering any more coffee. If you do not do this step the espresso will be very weak. The crema on top is great, but the espresso is weak. I like a strong espresso to start my morning.",

I have worked as a barista, and I have experience in brewing a good shot. It makes an ok latte, but if you are particular about your espresso, I'd continue shopping. A couple other issues are the steam wand is constantly in the way of brewing espresso, and the brewing area is so short that typical shot glasses or a cup will not fit under the brewing spouts, making it difficult to collect your shots.",

The coffee that is made with weak steam = very weak. 2. It passed the 1 year warranty mark. No luck. 3. I have owned 2 other delonghi coffee maker like this before.

It cost about $350 which was about $10 per month of use. I didn't want to shell out another $300-400+ for another machines, so I purchased the De'Longhi EC155 back in August of 2013 for less than $100. The good news is that it made really good espresso... while it lasted. My only complaint is that it vibrates quite a bit while the pump is operating such that the cup shimmys out of position during operation. It's an annoyance but not a deal killer. Unfortunately, the pump gave out after about 10 months of use. it's still under the one-year warranty but returning it to a factory service center is a hassle. While I will get it repaired under warranty, I will probably buy a manual type maker like the AeroPress or ROK. You get what you pay for.... 3 years out of a 350 machine or (not quite) 1 year out of $100 machine :-)",

We kept testing it and it would never get over 150 degrees.. Returning for something else. I know everyone says spending this money is gonna get you crap..

However, within 6 months, the performance of this machine went from a perfect stream of espresso, to coming out in drips. I cleaned everything meticulously. I sought support from Delonghi, primed the pump as instructed, etc. No improvement in pressure, so they determined the pump went bad. They replaced the unit, and I was up and running again. Almost. This replacement, which I believe was used/reconditioned, never had the performance of the original one when it was new, and now we're at a dribble again.

No problems with vibrations, dripping, leaking -- I loved it. A couple of months ago, it started dripping from the steaming wand when turned on, and then later, from the portafilter after the brewing was finished but while the steamer was in operation. I could deal with that. But, suddenly this week, it started leaking from the bottom of the machine, flooding the counter with water. I descaled it and there was no leaking during that process. But then while running clean water through it to flush out the descaling solution it flooded the counter again. It was great while it lasted, and I may purchase another one simply because it is the right size for my very small kitchen, but due to its relatively short life span, it's difficult to give a glowing recommendation. Based on my satisfaction with my machine a friend purchased one last December, but after relatively light usage it has started the dripping from the portafilter after the brewing operation has ceased but while the machine is still on for steaming. I fear her machine may not survive as long as mine. Since it is less than a year since the purchase, she may yet get to experience The DeLonghi Warranty Nightmare described by other reviewers.

One morning it started leaking out the back of the machine along the bottom near the electrical cord. I called the number on the back of the product and they said an \"o\" ring may have come loose or wore out. In order to have machine replaced I had to cut the electrical cord (not plugged in!) and send it to them. I sent the cord along with the my information (tracked) and literally a few days later I received a new machine. Down side is that this new machine has some quirks. The frothing light doesn't stay on long enough for a decent froth and the drip light doesn't stay on long enough for a double espresso. I'm going to give a few more days to see if I need to call the company again.",

Easy to use and clean, compact size and when working properly makes a good espresso. Having owned this twice there are a few issues that were consistent each time: 1) The steam spout leaks when you are heating up the machine. So, if you turn on the machine and walk away while it warms up you will come back to a small puddle of water. 2) Machine vibrates quite a bit so you almost have to hold the espresso cup in place while it presses the espresso out or it will eventually miss the cup. 3) This machine loses power over time. At around a year with both machines I was unable to get consitent froth/crema on top of the espresso. The above aside, this is the best machine for the money but ask yourself whether you want to buy another one of these every year or so or spend for a better machine.",

The plastic housing is not made of a heavy weight/durable plastic and the entire machine \"dances\" on the counter when it's making a cup of coffee. It's very loud and the movement on the counter is very frustrating as I need to hold the cup in place so that is doesn't move away from the espresso stream. Also you need to be advised that the space between the dispenser and base will only allow an espresso sized cup to be used, unlike my previous machine which allowed me to use a larger coffee cup sized vessel. As noted in other comments, when you remove the coffee filter holder after operation, the coffee is not dry (it's a dripping mess) therefore it's not easy to get to the sink or waste can to throw out. Operation is easy, however the round dial on the front is not intuitive in terms of how it points to the selected operation. The water reservoir is large and easy to insert and remove. This replaced a non-functioning Krups machine (also a bar pump) that I had received as a gift 10 years ago. The operation of the Krups was superior for the reasons I have commented on however the De'Longhi does make a better cup of coffee.",

I washed it over 10 times with warm soapy water, and a few times with cold water... soaked it overnight in vinegar, and again with pbw, but nothing would get the smell out. You could taste plastic in the coffee for the first solid month of use. The plastic taste has mostly faded by now, but it took 5 or 6 weeks of heavy use and cleaning before it did.",

It would only push through water if we used regular ground coffee very lightly tamped. Obviously, the end result is a very small quantity of very weak coffee. And when you want/need a coffee you don't want to get coffee-colored water in a small cup.. We've taken everything out and cleaned every piece and nothing improved. Will try my luck returning it to the manufacturer, but honestly I feel annoyed everytime I look at it. The water flowing out of the machine - even with no grounds at all - is really weak. Its entirely possible that I bought a bad machine but there is clearly not enough pressure in this machine to make an espresso drink. Think twice before you buy this because it seems like a good deal - and buy it from a store with a good return policy or using Amazon prime because there is a fair chance you will be sending it back.",

I had never had an espresso maker before so I can't compare it to cheaper or more expensive units, but it worked really well for what I needed. I used it for a single shot anywhere from 1-4x a day, almost every day for a year. Right around the 1 year mark, it started getting temperamental, and in relatively short order, started making a burning, electrical fire smell when I used it. I contacted the company and although the unit was out of the 1-yr warranty (by about 3 weeks), they agreed to send me a new unit for $14.95 shipping/handling. The new unit arrived and worked great, until about a month ago (10 months after replacement). I keep the machine very clean, clean the filters regularly, but it started being very slow pushing water through the grounds, taking forever to produce a shot and with no crema. Tonight I tried to use it and it wouldn't push ANY water through the grounds, not even drips. I'm debating trying to turn it in for warranty again or just calling it quits with this model. I think I'll probably be looking elsewhere.",

This was my first venture into at-home espresso making so I wanted to keep it simple and affordable. I did read reviews of this product before purchasing and that helped in my decision regarding purchasing this model. It is quite easy to use; I have made espresso and steamed milk with it. I was actually quite impressed with the steaming. It works very well and gets the milk hot rather quickly. Sometimes the espresso seems to pump out very slowly. It comes out in drops rather than a straight stream. I have cleaned the pod holder and it doesn't seem to matter. One other issue I have is that pods don't actually work; the espresso comes out watery. To solve this, I open the pods and place the grounds into the pod holder and this works well though it is an extra step. So now I just purchase beans and grind them to save money on the pods. If this is your first espresso machine and you don't want to pay a lot of money, this isn't a bad machine. I will be purchasing a higher quality, more expensive machine in the future.",

I feel that it should have lasted longer than 1 year and 3 months. It was easy to use and made good enough espresso but for $90 and the minimal use it got, it should have lasted longer.

The crema was minimal and the coffee tasted thin and a bit harsh. I've had better results with some automatic drip machines. I got lucky and found a minimally used Capresso Ultima on Ebay. The brew quality with the same beans and grind is much better - full bodied without harshness and a nice crema on top. Hard to say why the EC155 couldn't do better.

There is significant turbulence while coffee is being brewed which makes cup slide (while machine is standing on very even/horizontal countertop), so I have to hold it in place. Apparently two cups brew is possible, but attempted it and had uneven coffee strength. Currently I use it almost exclusively for milk steaming.

Initially I was quite impressed as it is pretty easy to use the machine and clean and maintain. However after weeks of experimenting, I realize that this is not going to work. The biggest flaw is the single motor. You're either going to get good frothed milk, or a good shot. Not both at the same time, unless you want to wait a really long time in between to let it heat up. I've experimented with many different beans that I grinded beforehand. Another flaw is the fact that the tip of the frother is plastic. I was tempted to buy a metal tip but I realized it's just not worth spending the extra $35 for a good tip for an $80 single motor machine that just can't heat up well. I returned it after a month, very disappointed. If you want a good espresso machine, you're going to need to spend $200+ it looks like.",

There is no way to tell how much pressure the unit exerts. There is a base amount of pressure that I'm defining as filter holder + filter without grounds. But even this amount can be varied because the filter is put together with a screw component that is taken apart when cleaning. This means that depending on how hard you screw it back into place, the base pressure it takes to push water out will differ. Then there is the question of tampering. If the base pressure is already 15 BAR, then any amount of tampering will make it harder to push water out and results in higher actual BAR. If base pressure is always lower than 15, then without what the actual number and how that pressure changes increases with tampering force, there is no way to get exactly 15 BAR. In the end, it will come down to trial and error. I'm probably never going to make a perfect cup of espresso with this machine. My spouse love the machine and would give it a 4/5 and says the espresso is not bitter when they make it.",

Yesterday it worked fine but this morning I turned it on and when I tried to use the swivel jet frother nothing came out. When I originally got this espresso maker it took a while to make a decent shot of espresso. It came out very diluted. I was almost at the point of returning it when I found out that I had to tamper the coffee grinds extremely tight in the filter holder. After that it made a decent cup of espresso. It wasn't until this morning that it stopped working. This was definitely a waste of money.",

                "review_text": "First I'll start off my saying I began my espresso purchases with a Mr. Coffee Espresso maker from Wal-Mart.com. After receiving the item the handle of the filter basket arrived broken. I promptly returned the item and began a search for a new one. I was really looking to buy a very inexpensive machine, not wanting to spend over $40 or $50. Thus, the lower price of this machine caught my attention. It is the 'cheapest' pump machine you can purchase. After reading thru pages of the several hundred reviews written on this machine I decided it was the one for me. I rarely saw negatives posted and for every negative comment on one topic I saw 5 positive topics that countered what the other person said. Meaning 5 people to 1 didn't have that problem or the 1 person was doing something wrong. I am by no means an espresso savy person. This is my first machine ever. I'm just tired of paying $3-$5 for a cup of whatever at McDonalds or Starbucks. To sum up this machine it's not EXACTLY what I thought. I have 2 negatives that, in my opinion, almost make me wish I looked harder at this machine. 1. It is VERY loud and vibrates hard when in use. When you actually are pouring the espresso shot the machine is very noisy and it literally moves on whatever surface you set it on. It moves so much in fact that whatever 'cup' you put under the spout, you literally have to hold it there with your hand or it moves completely off and falls off the machine. This caught me off guard as I only saw 1 negative comment about this. So either my machines works but is somehow broken and vibrates so badly I don't know if that's how it works or if it truely is broken. Whatever the case--I do not care for the vibration the machine causes. Thus I downgraded it 1 star for this bad vibration. 2. There is NO room for a cup under the filter basket at all. The only item I can get to fit to 'catch' the espresso is a shot glass. Thus, I can't even pour two espresso's at once for a 'double' b/c a double shot glass doesn't even fit. This really surprised me b/c I saw no negative comment about this at all. Literally, the only thing that fits is a small, shot glass. So, I'm unsure what other people are using, but it's the only thing in my kitchen that fits. I ordered 4 espresso cups that have yet to arrive. Unless they're as tiny as a shot glass (which they aren't) there's no way they will fit either. So I'm perplexed as to what to use. Thus I downgraded it another star level for no room. 3. The frothing wand is a bit short and as I read, the end of the wand is useless. I took it off to clean it and I can't even get it back on tight enough to where steam doesn't pour out of the top of it--yet it's screwed back on as tight as it goes. The wand definitely needs to be longer and more flexible. It is flexible somewhat, but it's flexible as in it'll move where you want it, but it won't stay. It gently glides back into another position no matter how far you move it. I ordered a 20 ounce pitcher and I'm unsure how I'm going to use it b/c the arm is so small. Other than those three negatives I've been happy. I've made about 5-8 shots and each have been perfect. Frothing is a bit hard to accomplish as I've yet to get lots of froth from milk. However, I just need more practice. I'd love it if someone who had vibrations problems like I'm having fixed it. I'd also love to know what people are using to catch their espresso shots. Thanks. Hope this helps anyone as this is a 100% accurate review from a brand new purchaser.",

The portafilter fits very tightly, and the machine weights practically nothing--dinky. So, you will actually need to hold the machine down with your other arm when turning it into position. Also, the steam wand gets in the way when we put the portafilter into place. You'll have to push that to the left so you can line up the basket into the group correctly. The espresso from this machine tastes pretty good, not excellent. We use very high quality beans meant for espresso brewing. We have used these same beans with a higher quality machine and gotten better results with taste. Finally, the water tank is very small. We make two quad shots each morning (8 shots) plus maybe a double later in the day. If you make that amount, you will need to refill the tank often. I did make sure to save all of the original packaging just in case this one does not hold up.",

I should have sent it back, but decided to live with it. Then, I ran through the flushing/priming procedures. I'm still not sure if this unit is defective, but MAN ALIVE this thing shakes/vibrates like crazy! When using espresso cups, I have to hold the cup in position so that it does not vibrate off of the platform. Next was the water/coffee delivery problem. Just as some others have complained about, I tried to brew my first cup and got bubkes, zip, nada, I took steps to avoid the errors that other made while using this machine, but still had problems. I tried again, but this time, I let the unit warm up for 30 minutes. Voila! I now have espresso (ok, not quite yet). It took a little trial-and-error on placing the right amount of coffee grounds in the holder and how hard to press the coffee down. Tips: Let the unit warm up for 15 to 20 minutes. Fill with espresso coffee grounds to the top, pack lightly, fill again to top off, pack a little harder (but don't push down too hard), and brew. Play around with it. I'm getting some great espresso now that I have the hang of it.",

It does produce a good espresso shot with a bit of crema. The biggest flaw in the design for me is that there is not enough height between the metal grate that the shot classes sit on and the spouts where the espresso comes from. I can barely fit a shot glass in between there which is annoying. If it had another 2-3\" between there a person could put there milk pitcher in there create there foam and walk away while the milk heats. Further more it would be nice to use a single 2 oz. shot glass to pour your shots in which creates one less dish to wash after. I would've also liked to see a bigger wand to steam the milk. Everything is just so compact and crunched. I was definitely disappointed by all of that. Overall it's a good machine for 80 bucks but if I would've known I would've stepped up to a higher end cappaccino maker that had more space overall.",

I wanted to get something for home that would make a decent espresso and not spend a bundle of money because I know these machines don't typically last. This machine was for my mother. The espresso is pretty good if you have the precise grind and tamp it properly - quite a bit of cream. I knocked off 2 stars for ease of use. The porta filter is very hard to crank on to get a tight fit. Terrible for my mother who has an old wrist injury and arthritis. Furthermore, the frothing wand does make killer froth, but it is just on top and does not inject the milk with frothy creaminess, very flat hot milk results. I find myself having to turn the steam off several times during steaming to wait for the green light to come back on because it peters out pretty fast. I also find that during the pouring of the espresso, whatever you have to catch the espresso (and it had better be short due to low clearance) vibrates out of the range of the drip almost immediately, so I must hold the pitcher EVERY time until I shut it off. You must also time the drip yourself as it is not a machine you can preset to shut off at the proper time. That being said, the espresso really is decent and would probably save a college kid lots of money. The saving grace is i didn't spend too much on it, so when i replace it I will definitely pop for a step or two up.",

Can only use a 12oz. frothing pitcher because anything larger won't fit under the steam wand. If you want to make a larger beverage (anything larger than a small) you'll have to brew/steam twice.

I should have sent it back then but I decided to try it out anyway. I started out by going through the manual and cleaning it (making espresso drinks with no coffee as the manual puts it). Lots of steam poured out from somewhere near the filter basket. There was enough steam to obscure most of the front of the unit from my sight. The steam was not coming from the steaming wand. The Espresso never got any crema on any of the shots I pulled.

The instructions ask that the unit be turned on 45 minutes before you make espresso and that is a big ask when you are getting ready for work. Also with the dripping foamer you lose a lot of water while waiting. We generally let it warm up about 10 to 15 minutes. I wish our old Salton model was available - I'd buy it in a heart beat.",

Instructions are somewhat long but overall use of the machine is not very difficult, except for the confusing Steam valve on top, which you would expect only works when the device is set to steam, but it actually can work virtually on any setting as long as the machine is on, and one must keep it in the closed position. I bought the espresso maker to make my own coffee at home with quality flavor and finesse. The machine delivers quality espresso, nice crema, at the right temperature and with a few tries, anyone should be able to make coffee with consistent great taste. The disappointment came only after using it a couple of times: 1. the height between the espresso pump and the cup holding area is too short. I couldn't possibly place any of my china's cups, and it a standard corelle, so all the cups are fairly small. I had to get a espresso set that would fit those narrow limits. Then, as soon as you switch the machine to pump water, the vibration and noise that hard that the cups move out of place, and the coffee would be lost! I had to manually hold the cups until full so the vibration would not move them. I got burned by a the hot spurt while learning this feat. Then I tried making cappuccino: The steam nozzle is fast and effective, it will heat up your milk and create good foam. However, it is quite short for which you can't use a deep jug, and whatever you use, will have to be fairly full before you start. Since it is so short it is hard to keep control over it and the foam overflowed every time leaving me with the mess. I have learned my lesson. My next coffee maker will have to accomodate most of my cups, not vibrate so much and have a longer steam nozzle!",

The first put out a beautiful cup of espresso about 2/3 of the time, but I'd not used distilled water and ours is very hard, so I blamed its early demise on that (8 months). The second delivered a good cup/thick crema only about 1/3 of the time, in spite of my very careful attention to warming, tamping, cleaning, grind, and water (distilled this time, only.) I finally returned it (the cut cord is what was required, and plenty of correspondence) and received a new one in the mail a couple of days ago. It appears that this one will be able to deliver a good cup with good crema about 1/3 of the time, also, although I'm certainly willing to persevere, as a really good cup is to die for. Maybe the technology is just not there yet. I am so consistent with the way in which I prepare the machine, coffee, etc., I can't imagine why there is such a variation in the final product.",

This delonghi unit is mostly plastic as the picture shows, has a slight cheap feel to it (well it is $80) but it's functional and makes a fine esspresso the same or maybe better than the more expensive older unit I was using. PROS: -Makes good espressos fast -Steam wand works fine -It just works, make delicous capacinos! -inexpensive CONS: -Drip unit is low, doesnt' fit normal size coffee cups underneath, must use shot glass cups or very low profile ones -Machine is lightweight with a lot of plastic, therefore it vibrates the whole unit and shot glass cup will vibrate out of place, just need to hold it in place for 3-4 seconds while it fills up... -would be nice if water reservoir was at least 50% larger, no big deal though! -seems like it will probably last a long time -Steam wand is short, must angle a cup to submerge wand for froth, but it still gets the job done easily I think it's growing on me the more I use it though. I've only used it a couple times so far. All in all if I could easily return or start over I'd probably get the $160 unit with similar reviews, just for the solid feeling, with less vibrating/moving cups. It's cheap enough where I can replace in a year and sell on CL for 20-25 next year anyways!

                "review_text": "This is my third De'Longhi EC155 (if you count the warranty replacement on my first purchase). My first machine started developing \"leaks\" from the steam wand within the first year of purchase. In addition, I found that the machine had problems developing enough pressure to push water through some of the more finely ground coffees such as Illy. With a little extra effort on my side, De'Longhi eventually responded to my inquiries and replaced my machine with a new one. I had some of the same issues with the second machine, but learned to work around the short comings and only use the more coarsely ground espresso brands such as Cafe Bustello. After about a year or so of regular high volume use (at least two double shots a day) the pump finally gave out and was unable to create enough pressure for even the more coarse grinds. I shopped around for awhile, and eventually ended up buying another EC155 since I knew it made good coffee and was relatively inexpensive. I will summarize the Pros and Cons and a few observations: Pros: - This machine is easy to use and makes good espresso with a nice crema layer - The steam mechanism works well enough and with some practice makes a decent latte or cappuccino - You can get this machine for between $70 & $80 if you wait for a sale - The footprint of this machine is pretty small - does not consume much counter top space - The machine is easy to clean and maintain. - Once contacted, De'Longhi was good about replacing the machine. Cons: - As noted above, and in other reviews, the pumps on these machines seem to have a fairly limited life cycle - Although I don't have any leak issues with the current machine, it still seems to struggle if the grind is too fine, limiting me to using Bustello or LaLave - The machine seems to have a fairly limited life cycle. Putting all of these issues aside, I decided for now that this was still the best machine for me to purchase. From reading reviews on other more expensive machines it sounded like many of them had issues as well, especially with pump life (and were sometimes difficult or expensive to repair). I am also willing to admit that I may not have cleaned my machines as routinely as necessary to avoid the issue with the pump. With that said, I still recommend this machine but with some reservations. I would also recommend the Krups XS5020 SST Frothing Pitcher due to it's low profile in order to fit under the wand. You can also purchase inexpensive tampers and thermometers on Amazon that definitely do the job. Just be careful not to under tamp (too much crema) or over tamp (to much pressure required). I will update this review once I have more history with my current machine.",

                "review_text": "I purchased this machine about a year ago based on the many positive reviews and reasonable price. Had I written a review anytime in the first 10 months of owning it I would be giving it 5 stars as it produced an excellent cup of espresso and seemed like a complete bargain. But then after around 11 months of regular use it wasn't making great espresso anymore. The unit had been cleaned and descaled regularly according to the directions but took much longer to pump out a cup and wasn't producing much crema anymore. This progressed quickly to it taking a very long time to make a poor cup with no cream whatsoever. At that point I read through all the reviews in more depth than I had originally and found out that this is a very common problem. If you actually use the machine a lot you will be lucky to get a year out of it before the pump fails. At that point I was happy to still be under warranty and contacted De'Longhi customer service. After a couple of emails back and forth with them to confirm I had serviced the machine properly they agreed to replace it. As instructed I sent them the power cord, my receipt and $15 (almost 20% of what I paid for the unit in the first place). They told me a replacement unit would be released for shipping when they received my power cord and check. They did cash the check promptly, but after a month I had still not received the replacement machine. Since I had received no communication from them at this point I sent a query as to the status of my replacement. After about a week I received a reply stating that they were sorry but the unit is on backorder and they will ship me one as soon as possible. Another 10 days have since gone by with no replacement or further communication. So there is a reason this machine is so much cheaper than anything else out there that makes decent espresso - it's not built to last. It still might be a bargain if you only use it on weekends or consider $80 a year cheap compared to Starbucks, but if you use it frequently expect to replace it every year. And then there is the customer service. It's unacceptable to me for a company to advertise a 1 year warranty, then take months (if ever) to actually make good on it. I see these are available for immediate shipping on Amazon, if De'Longhi cared to keep me happy they could order one of these or offer to refund my purchase price so that I can. When I replace this unit with a pricier one that has a longer lifespan I will be hard pressed to buy a De'Longhi.",

Overall: I like it, it does the job decently; but if I had the money for a nicer one like a Breville, I'd buy the nicer one. It's a vast improvement over my old one that has just one thermostat that would burn the coffee as it warmed up past the ideal temp for expresso on it's way to \"steam\" temperature.

Then the coffee started dripping very, very slowly. The basket filter was not clogged. I tried pumping water only without the basket - still only a few slow drops. I checked the round metal filter screwed into the water outlet on the machine, which sits above the basket and coffee. That filter was also not clogged, but I removed it and tried to pump water anyway. Still only a few drops dripping very slowly. The plastic water bin was full as usual, and seated properly in the machine as usual. I could not return the machine to the seller because they limit returns to 4 weeks after purchase, and the machine died about 11 weeks after purchase (pump failure). I have sent an e-mail to DeLonghi with a copy of the purchase order, and requested a refund. I give this machine 1 star for the 11 weeks that it worked without any problem. I hope other purchasers have had better luck. UPDATE: July 26, 2013 I contacted DeLonghi about the pump failure. Their first offer was for a product exchange. They told me to cut the cord off at the base of the machine, and mail it with a copy of the invoice. I wrote back and said I did not want another machine with a defective pump. The second offer was for a refund, and I needed to e-mail them a copy of the purchase invoice with the claim number. I did so. They sent a reply stating that they wanted the invoice in .pdf or .jpg format. I sent a reply telling them that nowhere in the purchase information, nor in the e-mail from the previous customer service rep, did they require a .pdf or .jpg invoice for a refund. I do not have Adobe software and cannot produce either .pdf or .jpg documents, and Amazon.com does not enable customers to download copies of the invoice in these formats. I sent the same invoice in an attached Word document and asked if that would suffice for a refund. If not, I will give them the info to view my Amazon.com account to verify the refund. Stay tuned if you want to know their reply.",

                "review_text": "I have been using the De'Longhi EC155 for about 3 months! It was back ordered and I had to wait 2 months to receive it after placing the Amazon order. For the price, it was worth the wait. I had a steam machine to make my Latte's previous to this one. I was actually happier with that machine and my Latte's, but as it died after 3 years(I so got my money's worth), I decided to get a pump version, but did not want to spend $$$$$$ on my next machine. I agree with all the reviews about the short froth arm, and the small espresso cups. I work at a Espresso bar and normally have 3 shots in my Latte's, so trying to drink them at home, with one small shot is a pain! I could empty, reload and make more shots, but that seems more of a pain then settling for my 8 oz. Latte. As I have to steam more milk for a latte and want the temp. at 150 degree, I do not understand why the green light keeps going off. It takes me about 4 times of turning the steam off, waiting for the green light, back on, then off. I have reread the manual, and it says this will happen. This is another pain I just deal with. I like the water reservoir, so you aren't filling with water every time. The espresso comes out very tasty! If you like Cappuccino, it does a great job of making foam. It does not cost a ton of money! So for the $79 I paid, I decided to keep it and put up with the flaws! Next purchase, I will pay more and get a more professional Espresso machine.",

I did a lot of research and found that this machine seemed to be a good deal for a quality machine. After I got it all set up on the kitchen counter, I found that when I poured water into the unit it would flood out of the machine. I wanted to keep the machine so I tried and tried and tried to reach someone through the Delonghi customer service line. The machine comes with a year warranty, which is nice, but let me tell you it is IMPOSSIBLE reaching someone through their 1-800 number. Cumulatively, I spent 5 hours on hold. One morning I even woke up at 5 am to call right when their lines opened (at 8am eastern time, I am on PST) and was still immediately put on hold. What is the point of offering a warranty if they have some dummy number that seems like it isn't even staffed? I am incredibly frustrated and disappointed. I will never purchase from Delonghi again.",

It made a pretty good shot of espresso. It took almost 40 minutes to heat up though, so set your alarm clock earlier, you will need the time. Also would recommend getting espresso shot glasses as the clearance from the head to the bottom of the unit is minimal. Steamed the milk well too.",

I had this machine for a year and it served its purpose well, but I was blown away by the difference when I upgraded to a more powerful machine. This machine will extract espresso better than a stovetop pot or a steam-driven machine. But the extraction will be fast and therefore more bitter than a true espresso. This is perfectly fine if you are planning on making lattes or adding sugar/flavor syrups. This machine will also steam milk, but will not allow you to get microfoam (no latte art) If you want to have room to increase your barista skills and get some really great espresso, I would recommend saving up a little more and getting the Breville Duo Temp Pro (what I upgraded to)",

So, if you are making 1 or 2 shots of espresso, takes about 30 minutes to make it. 3) Milk warmer and froth not great. 4) Difficult to clean.

It was noisy and vibrated the cups off the metal plate so you had to hold the cups while the espresso dripped. A total disappointment, I was so disgusted with it I got rid of it at a garage sale for $10.00.

This machine at a glance is great, it is easy to fill the reservoir, it warms up quickly, when you properly press the coffee it empties with ease as a nice hard puck. Why do I hate this machine then you ask? Well it is because since the day we received it there was a strange taste that gets infused in the brewing/steaming process. At first I thought it was simply whatever they used to clean the machine with, and so I filled the reservoir with water and ran the whole thing through the machine - but it makes no difference. I have now owned this machine for 6 months (long past its return point) and it continues to add in this horrible taste.",

One draw back was that the tank was pressurized so it took quite a while if you wanted to make a few coffees in a row - not good for dinner parties. Since we had other drip coffee makers, I replaced it with this espresso machine but it has been quite disappointing. You can only fit espresso or small cappuccino cups under the filter and it only takes a tiny amount of coffee so it is fairly weak for my tastes. I estimate the basket it takes less than half the amount of coffee in the the combo machine took. For a decent latte, it takes 3-4 double brews to get the same good taste that a single double brew on the combo gave. If all you want is a 2oz Espresso, this will probably work for you, else look elsewhere.",

There are all sorts of mods to improve it, but I'm thinking De'Longhi should have just created a product that works properly out of the box. I'm not rebuilding this machine to get a simple espresso or latte.",

                "review_text": "I read lots of reviews before settling on this espresso machine, so I was ready for the design \"challenges,\" which I didn't find challenging at all. (If you use a short bowl/cup for the espresso, and position the machine near the edge of the counter so the steam wand hangs off, it's not a problem.) I was so ready to love this machine but I encountered a couple problems that were NOT in the reviews: 1) The espresso is strangely weak-tasting, despite its dark color, and made an even weaker latte, even though I greatly reduced the milk proportion. I like a strong, almost \"burned\" flavored espressos/lattes and the lattes from this machine taste like a watery Starbucks. I tried several grinds and roasts but nothing really helped. I also tried making doubles (and triples) but the espresso flavor could not stand up to the milk. 2) The instructions suggest \"warming up\" the machine for 30 minutes before making your first cup! So, if you're like me and have limited time in the morning to enjoy your black gold, plan on setting your alarm 30 min early. The instructions also said that to speed up the warming process, you could run the machine several times with no coffee.... I don't know if that made a difference or not. I tried everything and kept waiting to taste strong espresso, but it never happened :( For these reasons, I must give a thumbs-down to the DeLonghi EC155, though it feels like I'm somehow betraying my Italian ancestry! Perhaps a \"steam\" style machine will suit my tastes better. UPDATE: I sort of figured out why my lattes were weak with this machine: it's because the milk frother \"sputters\" water before getting to pure steam. So I was watering down the coffee. The sputtering didn't stop and it was too labor-intensive to let it do that for a couple minutes into a cup or towel before it got around to steaming. Returned!!",

I looked past it because I was excited to have an espresso machine again. It leaked all over the counter the very first time I used it. I tried again, making sure to follow the directions and tighten up the handle. Still leaked everywhere. I am so disappointed to have received two defective items from the same company, however, Amazon was lovely about it and allowed me to send both back and they issued full refunds (I did have to call and debate the restocking fee they charged for one, but they reversed that as well.)

I can only compare this to either cheap-o machines or commercial machines. It is way, way better than the krupps and mr coffee cheap-o \"espresso\" makers that don't make enough pressure for true espresso. but the design is also far off from the commercial versions. I give it two stars because with freshly ground beans and a close eye, it does make great espresso.",

Hopefully the wait won't be too long but based on what we found by way of google, we are not getting our hopes up. Will probably have to go out and buy another machine and it will not be this brand! This is the second of these machines that we have purchased. The first machine we had worked great for a short period of time. Then whatever forces the steam through the grounds stopped working efficiently and we had to wait for the expresso to drip, drip, drip into the cup (the machine has a very low clearance so only an expresso cup will fit underneath the nozzle). It also lost that thick expresso characteristic. The coffee grounds cup is small so you can only make one expresso shot at a time. So to make a double shot latte you have to fill the coffee grounds cup twice and wait while it drip, drip, drips. In the end, this machine is just a fancy, very slow way of making drip coffee.",
