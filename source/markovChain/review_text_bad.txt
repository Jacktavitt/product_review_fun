poorly made does not fit photo description the opening to the bag is too small to fit anything in it other than an egg not to happy with it to pricey for the cuality it is a bad knock off of a product complete disappointment really cute bad but when you unzip it it stinks zipper is not wide enough returned zipper opening on top to small felt very cheap gave as gift smaller opening then expected but darling smells really bad the zipper is too small the bag does not open wide enough returning it nice cheaply made but fun the color is not even close to the one in the picture more like a really light yellow can't really use this as the opening on the top is too small but it has been fun to have returned didn't like the pale color expected it to be yellow strong plastic smell doesn't hold shape well but funny i love this bag and had to have it but when i recieved it the handle on this bag was already messing up and coming apart smells toxic returned for full refund no way is my year having something that smells this toxic and fyi it looks exactly like the picture like real chicken skin the zip opening at the top of the bag is too small to get into the bag very nice but zipper is soooo small can't even get my wallet in it have to reach my hans in it and have to geel wat i need can not reach and see at the same time really a pitty ordered this as a fun bag as this is the year of the rooster it is large enough to hold a wallet an umbrella a pocket camera a handphone a fat toiletry pouch that holds all my girl items my only dislike is the length size of the zip opening on top of the bag it is inches cm to put a regular size ladies wallet or an umbrella inside the bag i had to slip the item in sideways not length wise i think it will be hard to have to maneuver an item to it's shorter side inside the bag just to take it out of the bag and of course if you have big hands it will be a struggle to get your hand even inside the bag even with my hands xs gloves american size it was not easy for me and the straps are not long enough to carry the bag on my shoulder cute but the opening is very small it is hard to get things in and out you all tricked me i thought this was going to be great it was discolored wanky bad just not good i had so many high hopes well we bought my mom the chicken purse and we were so excited it came when we opened it was plastic and that's not completely bad it was semi waterproof but as we looked more into it and we liked it we were going to put all of the stuff in the purse but the whole zipper was too small you could not put anything in it the purse also had a really insane smell but for women who don't like big purses with small wholes i do not recommend this for you even though it is really cool it looks like a pretty good chicken the only problem is that it has a lot of space you can t put your things in there i think it just needs to shrink in size and open the zipper more and it will be fine and pleas get rid of the smell this is adorable but it's cheaper elsewhere on amazon try here https www amazon com rubber chicken purse hen handbag dp b g n i ref pd sim sbs ie utf psc refrid kt rtdmg c cb p smells awful i washed it a few times with mild soap and still like bag but thought chicken would be bright yellow as in picture the tubing in handles moves out and about a bit love concept though i purchased this bag thru amazon and i agree the opening is quite small which means your wallet would have to be small to come out i decided not to keep it but they were going to charge me plus change to return it shame on them so buyer beware if you don't love it its going to cost you to return it i would rather give it away before i pay them to have me delvier it to their amazon store and pay to return it very disappointed but will not make that mistake again amazon the zippered opening is quite small and restrictive but the bag in whole is a hoot this is poor quality so when you get it and want to send it back because you hate it they're going to charge you to send it back i wouldn't pay one cent for this let alone do not buy this the zipper is so short i can get my hand in but to grasp my wallet and pull or is a hassle used one day and was so frustrated i dumped the contents and tossed in tbe closet cute idea but the designer needed to think a minute zipper needs to be twice as long the tiny inside pocket is too high to be functional need to drop it inches to be useable do not buy you will be disappointed cute purse the opening is way to small love the design but the rubber started to tear along the tail end of the bag after a week i am a bummed out chicken lover the zipper in the top really is too small item is discolored really fun purse but smells awful the opening is not very wide so it makes it difficult to get things in and out of it the lining seemed really cheap and i was afraid it would tear in no time i really wanted to love this purse but ultimately ended up sending it back i liked the looks of this purse i thought it was right cute and it is cute but i could not get my big ol' hands inside of it it just did not work for me at all somebody should have warned me that this purse was for people with little hands but they didn't so don't buy this purse unless you have little bitty tiny hands to fit into the chicken very cute and it is a gift for my mother in law she collects chickens so i know she will love it loved the idea of this bag the chemical smell was just too overwhelming had to send it back i just received my chicken purse today and there's a two inch hole in the seams i'm pretty unhappy about it not that i expect the highest quality from a chicken purse but i certainly didn't expect holes everyone who sees this bag loves it the zipper hole is way to small and the inside pocket is in the way but holds a lot may take mins to find ur keys in it the opening could be better excellant quailty heavy duty but ugly as hell the red eyed chicken has a demon like look i found it to be very cute but the zipper is to small to get things in and out of the bag very small opening zipper too small loved the purse so cute but it's so flat thought there was something to blow it up i saw a video and she just blow it up was the video wrong it would take alot to fill the purse with your stuff to make it round cute but the zipper is so small it makes the bag unuseable it was a thinner cheaper material then i thought it would be even though my sister loved the gift it didn't seem like it would hold up very long at all it's fun quality is what you would expect mild plasticky smell i bought it because the description says origin italy so i thought it would be a bargain the bag is stamped made in china that brings to mind quality issues lead in paint toxic plastics etc and the fact that in china this probably cost maybe my expectations were too high it was very nice i bought it for my granddaughter for easter we thought it was much larger than we expected i bought this bag to carry to work on april st and also to use on easter it got lots of smiles i wish the handles were just a little bit longer it's tough to carry over my shoulder also the zipper on top is too small makes it difficult to reach in and out to retrieve keys tissues etc but all in all it served the purpose to elicit a smile or two from my friends hello the rubber chicken hen tote bag is cute and ordered i was very dissatisfied because there were reddish color blotches all over yellow chicken i believe red color dye ran from the handle when not dry i have the chicken here and the box if you want it returned i was told that i had a refund and hope so love the chicken but not blotchy with color thanks for trying happy with other items nancy schoettler she has no pockets and her zipper opening isn't too wide but i guarantee you she will be a real conversation starter doesn't look like anything of the picture too small for adult will have to send back and buy another present for mother the picture on website is cute and attractive but the product is with poor quality not recommend to buy almost the worst one in my amazon's order history the zipper opening is too small to fit my hand in much less a wallet so i was disappointed in usefulness bought two one for me and one as a gift thought i could use as a fun lunch box for work my co worker who got the one as a gift changed the zipper to a longer one so she could get her sandwich out without it being crushed on the way out the chicken purse is made of vinyl and is not very made for anyone wanting a real purse this bag is very large and is for some one that wants a bit of whimsy it is cute and was bought for an elderly person who is crazy about chickens she loved it i love my chickens and i really do like the concept of this purse it is made of rubber and therefore would be a great purse for rainy weather when the purse arrived it had been folded for shipping i can understand that however i have to keep it fairly loaded so it doesn't look like a folded chicken i love carrying it and always get compliments or at least giggles but i have had to quit carrying it since the zipper is so short and it is a constant struggle to get my wallet in and out through the zippered opening when i do manage to get the wallet through the top it always seems to hang on the pocket inside the purse and i have to struggle to get it past that obstacle too i am really disappointed that the inconvenience is greater than the pleasure of carrying it since i really do like the bag i think it would have held up well if i had been able to use it more often but alas i guess it was not meant to be on the plus side once you are able to fit your items into the bag it holds quite a bit of necessary things that women like to carry around with them another plus for this bag is that if you happen to be of child bearing age and also happen to have a small person you are carrying around with you i'm sure a couple of bottles would fit in here nicely along with a diaper or two and if a bottle happened to leak hey no problem rubber chicken will protect liquids from bleeding through and damaging anything the purse happens to be sitting on you would have to be careful with the diaper suggestion though i think the zipper would probably tear the plastic around the diaper i saw a girl at the gym with this bag and i had to have one the zipper was really small and i could not easily put anything inside it without intricate time consuming maneuvering it was a conversation starter and the kids loved it i took it to a farm school and the real chicken there had issues with it and tried to attack it when i first unpacked it i was thrown off by the smell and i hoped that in time it would diminish no it didn't it's like a dead body was dipped in petroleum and glued to a giant moth ball the fumes are so intense it makes your nose burn and your contact lenses bend inside out you will weep for any kind of relief i filled the entire purse with bounce sheets and wrapped it in wax paper and stuck it in the freezer for a week to see if the smell would fade away no such luck all my frozen food smells like it's been shoved up the tail pipe of a big rig i had to throw everything out i put baby powder in it and wrapped it in bubble wrap and put it outside for a week and then poured baking soda in the purse to see if that would help no it didn't although i really loved the concept and whimsy of the purse i finally gave up the dream and donated it to goodwill by dumping it in an overnight depository at this time i must apologize to the needy who will discover this petroleum treasure i mean you no harm but it's cute isn't it this is a hen bag it is a great gag gift but i am sure it will fall apart given a lot of use its build quality is not that of a michael kors or tory burch bag it is made of thin rubber or vinyl or something of that ilk barring the handles which are rolled canvas where these stitch to the rubber is bound to fall apart eventually that said it's a hen bag the color is wrong on the pic the bag is more yellow orange and i don't like it smells terrible hole zip is really small and it hard put your stuff easily i got this along with a baby chick coin purse to give to my mother as a gift the quality of this purse is so cheap i can see them selling this same purse for at most and that's giving it a huge mark up for its novelty value it probably only cost them like two bucks to make it the material is thin and due to the way it's been packaged for who knows how long the purse is lumpy the area around the tail is folded out at an unflattering angle and one side of the face is lower than the other along with many other lumps and bumps the purse deflates easily and probably would only look nice if it was kept quite full however since the material is so thin my mother is worried that filling it too much will make it break the plastic rod in the handles also seem like they may come loose and fall out if you're not careful i can't believe i paid so much for this at least my mother was amused by the idea of the purse rather than its execution thankfully the coin purse i got her made her really happy as it is something she can use for a long time if you or a friend are chicken enthusiasts then this is a fun gift the purse feels like a rubber chicken which i don't personally love but my friend did the problem is that the opening on top is too small and makes it difficult to load and unload it the matching coin purse is cute but has the same problem i bought an egg key chain to go in the coin purse for my friend and it wouldn't fit in the opening and it is hard to get coins out of it unless you dump it over i made a box that looked like a chicken nest and put easter eggs in and around it and gave it to my wonderful boss for easter i don't know if she liked it or not she had seen it in an expensive tourist shop in savannah ga and thought it was really fun so i ordered one for her very cheaply made absolutely unattractive and has a very strong 'toxic' smell of rubber would never let a child get close to it she was very cute but extremely stinky rubber and the opening on top is way to small to be used practically cute but the zipper opening is way to small to be able to get anything in or out at all i love the look of it everyone conpliments i must ware my things out because after a month or so the rubber under the handles started to tear have no clue where to get that fixed totally thought rubber was more durable i was wrong and naive i cant return it someone told me to take it to a purse company see if they could fix it i doubt there are many professional places that would fix rubber purses lookin like chickens if anyone knows of any give me a reply thank you i love my chicken purse but the smell is so horrible i'm not sure how long it will last but i have stopped using it for now as everywhere i go i smell like some nasty mix of body odor and a tire the purse is adorable though and the times i went out with it i got comments every single time everyone loves it i got this purse from a friend for my birthday we had seen one about a year early and loved the idea of it however i have only had it about a month the tag has already fallen off it somewhere so i can't open and close the purse the zipper is so small it is difficult to carry almost anything in it or to even try and find what you have in it is almost impossible please come out with a vegetarian version think about what it would be like if a dinosaur or a shark carried a purse that looked like you wouldn't that make you feel less than give the chickens a break it's not enough that we slaughter them by the millions every day reducing their beautiful bodies into nuggets a henbag really perhaps you're too chicken to weave your purses out of hemp or fashion a rubber tofurkey handbag having lots of fun carrying this hen bag yet the opening at the top is small hard to access the interior see whats inside removing or putting items in is a struggle great novelty gift item for those chicken lovers thick rubber purse with very small zippered opening i have small hands and i barely could squeeze my hand in but it was purchased more as a gag gift it was love at first sight for me and hen ry and i had to have him i told my husband about this purse and how much i wanted to have it my husband knowing how much of a bag person i am has been wanting to get me a new purse for months but between a new baby and me not finding a purse i liked had put it off until now he ordered it the next day for me and of course was super excited and i tried out hen ry for a full day the next day cons i did read the reviews prior to purchasing and a few commented on the small zipper opening and i did study the picture of the opening that has been posted and let me tell you this i completely under estimated its size it is really small i couldn't appreciate how small it was until i tried to put everything i carry into hen ry i tend to carry a lot of stuff with me and as my husband will say everything including the kitchen sink and with the small opening it makes getting stuff in and out annoying i use a long wallet similar to coach f ashley signature sateen wallet khaki mahogany and i was barely able to fit it inside horizontally i also use a coupon organizer similar to c line biodegradable pocket expanding file coupon size file folder color may vary and i had a similarly hard time as my wallet putting it in there is only one small interior pocket and i was hoping to use that as my phone pocket but it didn't fit my iphone too well i happen to work in an office environment and thus i carry my office keys and other work related things along with my personal stuff so having only one pocket hurts me in keeping everything organized the bag came with a rubbery chemical smell and i knew that the bag would have some sort of a smell with the type of material its made from but it gave me a pounding headache which i didn't expect pros it's an attractive bag and i received many compliments on my first day out with him i love to make people smile and this bag does just that the overall interior is quite roomy if you carry a lot of little items with you or travel light the small zipper opening shouldn't be an issue for you with its rubbery exterior it makes cleaning very easy overall would i recommend this bag yes for the most part but if your anything like me in how i carry everything with me then no i will be returning hen ry and it greatly saddens me i really hoped we would work out but it wasn't meant to be this is a cute purse but i'll agree with the other reviewers the zipper is way too short which doesn't allow for easy access the material doesn't seem durable it's basically the same material as the rubber in a halloween monster mask the lining is made of cheap nylon as are the handles nylon webbing but like i said for the price eh the purse is cute and made well the opening is way too small it needs a larger zipper the coin purse is the same this is not a toy i bought it more as a joke than a purse it's very cute but smells like the rubber it is made of and the opening on top is rather small i had read this on other reviews but thought it would still work for what i wanted it for we have a group of mothers and daughters who travel together for a shopping trip once or twice a year as a bonding weekend it's become known as chick weekend i thought this would be perfect for it i bought two of these one for my daughter and one for my daughter in law they weren't as thrilled with them as i thought they would be but i still think they were are cute maybe its an age thing this purse taste like chicken lol but seriously it does not i would not eat this probaly the bag has a lot of space and the feather lining is cool at first but annoying when your key gets lost in there light skin tone and dark skin tone are you kidding me no mention of mixed skin tones in product description and photo shows matching hands how hard is it to sort the hands by color epic fail these are the cutest little things but of the ten eight were right handed and only two left of the right hands six were pink and two brown such a shame not to take the time and care to get it right you will get an uneven number of left and right handed finger puppets i received left handed puppets and single right handed puppet fail i was looking forward to getting sets of left and right hands but got right and left hands should've said in description that it was a random assortment can't even return or replace the product fun but i got left fingers out of which is supposed to be left vs right description should mention that you will receive a random number of left and right hands and various skin tones i was given left hands i was expecting left and right left right these are very funny but i received left hands and right hands i wish i actually had complete sets of hands that would make more sense then i would rate it five stars they are definitely funny but unfortunately the left and right hands did not match up so my plan to give them as funny little gifts will not work since people would end up with pairs of left hands still funny to have but not as successful as if there were actual pairs instead of mostly left hands with a couple rights they worked fine but i also received uneven amount of left and right hands ummm two of the hands are mexican and the remaining are caucasian this item isn't eligible for return so i guess i'm stuck with a random assortment the photo showed ten matching hand finger puppets that is not what i got boo buyer beware item not as expected received left hands and right hands hands of one skin tone with hands of a different skin tone no return policy watch me get my money back scam really disappointed as i ordered two packs and received right hands i only ordered two packs because i thought i could piece together a full set since some people got left hands then even more disappointed to find out i can't return them i guess someone's getting a bunch of finger hands as their white elephant gift or i could just leave them around town in random places fun stocking stuffer but i got brown hands instead of the last two white hands not a big deal but kind of disappointed left hands and right hands not what i was hoping for they are very good quality and fit nicely on all my fingers but i m a little disappointed that it came with right hands and only left i got right hands and left hands a good product other than that i had matching left and right hands but as a previous review mentioned there was one brown hand in the mix they should all be white or all be brown but not mixed i plan to use them for counting in groups of five so it looks weird the kids end up asking more about why is that hand brown and those white instead of concentrating on the point of the counting major distraction i was very excited for these i had ordered a set of small hands for all of my friends for christmas unfortunately i received three right hands and seven left hands so now i have to give two friends only left hands extremely dissatisfied i received right hands left hands and one of them is brown while the others are all white this is an assortment not a set i want my money back received l and r i love them there super funny idk why but they are the only reason it doesn't get five stars is because i received left hands and one right kind of a bummer creepy i got my package today and only got hands uggghhh i still like the item but i m very disappointed that i didn t get all the hands the quality is awesome the fit is awesome the level of hilarity is awesome but i only got three right hands and seven left hands getting only three right hands sucks i'm right handed my physical comedy is right handed and i assumed there would be five of each only after i received three right hands did i decide to read the reviews boo makes no sense really what's wrong with this picture i got left hands and right hand same issue as stated hands aren't an actual set of left and right product info needs to be updated i ended up with left hands which are of no use to me it said there was suppose to be left and right but i only got right hands and left false adverstiment you will not get an even amount of tiny hands don't be fooled like i was ten hands should have five rights and five lefts not the case came with white left hands and one dark right hand could have at least given me one matching pair i sure did get lucky it wouldve been nice to get pairs at least i got one pair but i should've expected this reading the other reviews i received left and right but i took the gamble after reading other reviews only received hands left right i got left hands and right ones only downside on this should of have listened to people bought before me received left and right what can i do with them now very disappointed that they don't sell these in a darker skin tone but still fun i received right hands and left hands i got right hands and left hands and the color is darker than in the pictures they do the trick though i guess while my kid's love the product i got right hands and left this obviously upset them i reached out to swap but was told that they are packaged randomly who would think to have to ask to make sure you get an equal amount of opposite hands all of them were very very dark in color disappointed my children choked and died on these whatever you don't buy amazon should take this off not all one color and i got right hands and left so you know fun for what they are but i guess don't expect a even distribution of hands ordered it the first time and got right hands and left hands which was great ordered it again and the package had left hands and right hands that's bs it's not a set of ten finger hands it's just ten finger hands it's misleading to tell people in the reviews that you get left and right hands other than that product is exactly what it is these arrived and rather than being white hand finger puppets there were only white and brown this is not what is illustrated in the image for that reason i would expect to be sent another that complete the set i received right hands and left hands received rigor and left not real helpful when one goes missing there was pair of hands that both was right hands in stead of one of every side product has more right than left hands and one of the hands is not of the same tone makes it useless when i was needing complete pair nine left and one right in a darker skin tone was needing a pair so a real bust but they are okay in quality just not having both left and right means can't give as gifts or have quite as much play value for someone i love these hands but there is no guarantee that you will get lefts and rights i got lefts and rights don't have a complaint about the product itself but i find it kind of hard that you can't equally count out right hands and left hands the right hands and the left hands that i got just kind of upset the ocd that i don't even have they were fine quality but there were white and brown hands also packaging was poor they were just thrown into a bag complete pairs would have been appreciated the item i received was not as described i didn't get pairs of hands i got hands but only complete sets were right hands and one was a different color returning these are incredibly fun but we received a really weird mixture we got right hands and left hands one of the ten hands is brown it would have been nice to have a matched set of two brown hands brown hands matter too the quality of these hands has dropped a lot since i last ordered them they still look okay but nowhere near as good as they used to hands are great quality but i got left hands and right hands don't expect sets fun product but i received left hands and right hands i wanted to use these as gag gifts and now i can only give two pairs it would be nice if the seller took the time to make sure there were five pairs of hands came with rights and lefts now there's preschoolers with only one hand i'm a little confused i got pale hands and tan hands the hands face different ways and neither are a complete set well i only received and they're not sets there were lefts and right super weird want to send me lefts and rights please well the hands themselves are fine but i had the same problem other customers did unequal number of left and right hands i received left hand and right hands kind of useless to me that way hence just stars from me got this as kids' stocking stuffers and they like to wear one on each hand having fun with tiny hands going into the donations pile great product but i received left hands and right hands someone is not paying attention these are cute and i have things planned for them but i only got two complete sets of left and right hands the rest out of are left hands so basically i paid bucks for two sets which sucks this is silly it says set of finger hands so my normal assumption was left and right nope i got left and the rest right dumb this is listed as a set but i received left hands and right pretty disappointing if you can't use them together waste of money i received nine left hands and one right hand useless i repurchased these from before however this new set is not the same as the one pictured the hands are waxy and a different skin tone i was not expecting the change nothing makes life better than wearing tiny hands and having unsuspecting persons discover them sheer shock delight are some of the normal reactions i just ignored the people that were ho hum about them like they were part of normal everyday life sadly i can only give this a three star the package arrived with left hands and right hands so it only made pairs i was expecting pairs of hands instead i only got pairs and right hands quality of the material is what i would have expected fingers are slightly bendy but always go back to a normal hand in these turbulent times it is a travesty nay an outrage that hands of color are not represented in the tiny hands community i ordered pairs of hands but upon receiving them i got of them being a left and right hand but then i got two right hands for my th pair of hands sad that i don't have a matching pair with those two but regardless the baby hands are still comical these things are hilarious but unfortunately i only got right hands and left hands it kinda makes it hard to divide up the hands between my own hands the product itself is great but the downfall is the packaging i ordered sets of thinking i would get 'sets' of right left hands well i got a lot of left hands in each bag disappointing since they were to be given as sets of hands for a halloween prize package and i also got 'caucasian' hands and african american hands in the mix that was not even mentioned in the description nor was it an option would not order again i received right hands and left the product description says right and left hands i ended up with right hands and left hands the product itself is exactly what i wanted but i'm disappointed that i didn't get the correct proportions right hands and left hands is it too much to ask for an equal amount of each hand also if you have big fingers these may not fit so well i love these hands when i have actual pairs i would have expected that when you order 'set of ten finger hands finger puppets' you would be recieveing pairs yes it only says ten the word pair is not there at all but really would anyone really expect when you are buying hands that you would get left and right hands pretty disappointing i have tried times and each time what you get is never the same and could not be really at least in my humble opinion the word 'set' should be removed from the discription because really all you are bying is finger hands finger puppets they are great with the exception of we got right hands and left hand was hoping to get of each but at least we have one good hand these tiny hands provided so much laughter at the office but we were limited by the fact that we only received one right hand still made for a funny group icebreaker but just know when you order these don't base the purchase off of being able to use both tiny hands otherwise everything else about them was perfect i received lefts and rights so that was a little weird the coloring is pretty off but obviously hands are differently colored pretty good product just not sure why i didn't get lefts and rights i'm very disappointed with this product because i received left hands and right epil fail on this item out of all hands only was a left hand very disappointing buyer beware these are fun little hands when i bought i assumed i'd get left hands and right hands that's what i get for assuming i received right hands and left hands giving me only complete sets that's not cool if you want just random hands and don't want sets these will be fine for you these are a cool little product but i am very disappointed that the hands did not come with right and left i ended up with lefts and rights which means i only have sets of hands we had fun with them except i only received two left hands the rest were right kinda weird left hands absolutely useless described as and very disappointing sent my boyfriend six left hand and four right hand fingers but good product received seven left hands and three right hands i was rather disappointed not to have even numbers of each appendage otherwise they're exactly what they seem left and right hands received but still very fun these are hilarious but only three are sets and four right hands was a bummer while i love these finger hands i do have some issues with them the paint wears down quickly and make the hands look darker and more dirty although it makes the veins on the back look more real i received right hands and left hands i don't know if the description was changed from when i ordered but the current description says only right hands it would be nice to have an equal number of left and right hands i like having the thumbs match my thumbs we take these everywhere and either get excitement and smiles out of people or get awkward and creeped out looks i love the details with the veins and fingerprints though they are a little tight on my fingers but i think most people won't have this issue why this product is everything that you would think it was the look on someone's face when you show them you tiny hands there is only one problem that would hold these off from being the most awesomest in the whole world they don't have a left hand its kind of an outrage really why cant i even find the lt hand hey i have five of these tiny hands on my right hand and well oh look i have five of these tiny right hands on my left hand too i hereby start the petition to produce the left hand does not play vinyls well at all brand new records play like they've been warped for years very disappointed in this product good looking record player for a good price but any imperfections to the vinyls and the sound will be terrible i was so happy when i got it but the pitch switches from sharp and flat regularly was not worth the horrible sound this review is honest and sincere to prevent a bad vinyl listening experience don t buy this record player invest in something higher quality such as an audio technica lp or lp for the same price as this one the u turn orbit is another great one or go vintage i own an old onkyo turntable from the s and it sounds great crosley cruisers don t come with a pre amp like the lp so you can t plug in passive speakers this player will also destroy your records which will add up so if you can t afford a nicer table go vintage or just don t buy one biggest piece of crap i have ever had the displeasure of owning broke after a month of very light use i have friends who got this and it worked fine every record i used sounded terrible on my turntable but it was fine on my friends get over the looks of this thing and get an audio technica lp for the same price awesome value if you care about preserving your records because this will damage them making money off of hipsters the turn table is uneven so it makes all my vinyls seemed warped highly disappointed expected more from crosley will never buy again it appears that the sound is hit or miss in my case the sound quality was sub par made stevie nicks sound demonic which is a musical crime i will say it's cute as hell though looks cool but the sound is total garbage don't waste your money the crosley company owners are complete crooks junk no sound that i heard full blast grover washington marvin gay the description states oldies are these not oldies my hubby opened the box and took one look at the speakers and said send it back it will not have any sound unless you put you ear i inch from the speaker at high not even with additional speakers it would not help it is not made for larger speakers there goes another we sent it back within the week if you don't believe me a verified purchacer then buy it and see for your self record tend to skip alot this was a gift for christmas and i can't play it due to missing cords i unfortunately can't find the recipet for it to return if anyone knows what i'm supposed to do so it will play let me know my right speaker no longer works and i can say i take care of this product with the up most care the manufacturer needs to improve this product spent the money on this after so much debate and research and really wish i wouldn't have poor sound quality turned into virtually no sound for no reason the headphone jack is definitely not meant for auxiliary loud buzz clicking and the output didn't give me any additional volume i wasn't traveling with this thing so i have no idea why it would have suddenly decided to just stop making making sound frankly i don't see the value in investing the time or or additional money into finding out i can just help you i have never purchased anything that went so badly so quickly in my life that was so expensive from such a reputable name in my opinion you could do better buying anything else at all from any other other brand do not buy this if you have any plans of actually playing records on it it is the worst quality record player i've ever used in my life this thing is only good as a gimmick or a funny gift do not buy this i repeat please do not waste your money and ruin your records the crosley portable turntables not having an adjustable counterweight have been proven time and again to apply too much pressure to your records what does this mean it means every time you play a record on this turntable the needle digs a deeper groove into the vinyl wearing away at the sound quality this will eat your records shell out a little more for an audio technica at lp amazing table for a low cost if you want to actually preserve your records one more time for the stubborn do not buy this horrible product i bought this record player because i loved the look of it and the fact that it is small portable but that is where the good qualities end the sound quality with this thing is horrible it's very pitchy and wobbles the record so the sound goes in and out spend a little extra money and get something better i actually bought my friend a victrola nostalgic aviator wood in bluetooth turntable entertainment center for christmas and am jealous i didn't just buy one for myself as well it's only double the price but has way better sound quality it also records onto cds which is nice because it captures that static record sound so that you can listen to a record anywhere literally buy anything else every one of these has a fatal design flaw that makes playing modern records impossibe the speakers are built into the device the device that relies on picking up very specific vibrations to play the music think about that as the speakers vibrate the needle vibrates and skips this isn't so bad on old thinner records from the s s and s but newer thicker records with better bass response will skip all over the place so don't ever buy an all in one turntable because they will all skip when playing new records if you don't want to spend the money on a proper turntable proper speakers and a proper amp receiver then seriously reconsider whether vinyl is actually right for you or if you are just following a trend if you value convenience over the experience of listening to an entire album all the way through then feel free to take advantage of the last years of advancements in technology another fact that you need to know is that no vinyl does not sound better than cds it doesn't sound warmer or more true assuming perfect media conditions then the sound quality is indiscernable by human ears any perception that vinyl sounds better or even different at all is entirely placebo in double blinded studies no one has ever been able to tell the difference between cd vinyl and even cassette tape so why do people think that vinyl sounds better why do they like vinyl if it doesn't sound any different well because many young people alive today have only ever experienced itunes mp s and other compressed audio formats all physical media will sound better than an mp becuase it hasn't been compressed had certain frequencies and sounds removed to save disk space as to why people would prefer vinyl even though it sounds the same i think people are tired of not owning their music you can buy songs piecemeal from itunes but you never own them they still belong to apple and you're just licensing it from them they can take it away from you at any time but if you buy an album on physical media then it's yours and if you're going to buy something physical you might as well get the big one with the nice album art if you want a nice automatic tt on a budget go with an audio technica lp you can even get one with usb out so you can run it through your computer if you're too cheap to buy speakers and an amp oh and stay away from bluetooth speakers because they compress the audio and you might as well be listening to mp s at that point good luck kids it was supposed to be a birthday present but it wouldn't even turn on it worked decent for the first months after that it mysteriously stopped working entirely cheaply made audio port doesn't work chinese garbage as a record store you would think we would be thrilled that people are buying record players however when it comes to these portable turntables excitement couldn't be further from our minds they are sleek and light but beyond style they fail miserably at their primary function playing records the main issue with these turntables is their lack of a counter weight at the base of the tone arm this weight is a vital component of any record player as it set the correct force grip if you will on the record with the stylus without this weight you will have a stylus that skates across several of your records g records in particular if you plan on playing dynoflex records exclusively then you may be able to avoid any issues our recommendation buy a record player with a counter weight was very screechy bought this a couple years ago worked great at first but after the fifth or sixth album i played on it the sound started going all pitchy and awful it's useless now and i ended up donating it six months after purchase because no one wanted to buy it and i didn't want to sell someone a piece of junk do your research and spend a little more on a quality record player don't get sucked in by the cute factor of this one because that's literally all you're paying for first set and it's replacement we're piles of expensive trash the company that makes it even admitted to me they were terrible quality horrible sound uneven turning scratch disks the list goes on spend the money on tried and true brands this isnt one of them first off i didn't buy this my brother in law bought one for his daughter roughly months ago she brought it to me today hoping i might be able to help her with it the problem it plays too slow at the rpm speed the speed also sometimes varies a bit but never gets near the proper rpm i didn't try the other speeds except to note that the rpm setting is too fast for rpm albums a good thing but i didn't test to see if it played the right speed for 's apparently when new the player held roughly the proper speed but the motor and or belt has been fading away over the past few months so i went to the amazon reviews where i first noticed that a full of the reviews are two stars or less a good many of the complaints are in regard to faulty speed there is obviously a quality problem here that the manufacturer is not addressing instead in response to so many of the reviews they point out the obvious that if the album is rubbing against something it will play too slow that canned response gets to be a bit tiresome after the first or reads i noticed several other complaints that hold true for my niece's unit but one must admit this really isn't meant to be a high quality product if it would play the proper speed i would give it four stars for being pretty much what you should expect from it as is it doesn't deserve even one star as it is simply useless other things to consider yes the weight on the needle is quite heavy and i would not put prized vinyl underneath it the speakers do give mediocre sound but it was good enough for the money paid my daughter connected an oontz bluetooth speaker using the headphone jack on the phonograph and the sound was good considering the system this was the unit without bluetooth so again the bluetooth speaker was connected by a cord interesting that at the moment they are charging you more for the privilege of not having bluetooth color availability i suppose some people have complained about the needle skipping i didn't have this problem seems to me the company would do well to drop the input sockets and the rca output sockets and put the savings into a better motor belt crosley cr a tu cruiser portable speed turntable turquoise i loved this when i got it almost a year ago however i've played it less than times and i put a record on yesterday and it played very slowly and distorted the sound very disappointed do not buy this yes it's cute and portable and very very trendy but it skips on brand new records upon returning the record the second one we'd attempted to play on the machine we were informed that the record store receives returns daily on records since the popularization of the crosley really only buy it as a fashion accessory or a prop you'll be disappointed thinking you're going to have this great analog experience with your vinyl my daughter was crushed the volume isway too low i got this as a gift and the design of the unit is very sleek i've only had it for a day but have discovered a few things that might upset people in hindsight summary it looks cool and sounds ok for the price you're paying unfortunately you need a pretty open space so the case can open up completely to prevent the record from rubbing against it if you want higher quality when playing your records i suggest investing in a higher end professional turntable from audio technica numark pioneer etc and plan on spending at minimum note these kind of turntables don't come with built in speakers this is a fun little novelty item that's pleasing to the eye more details helpful tips the case has to be fully open when playing records i saw reviews saying that the records sounded warped or like the turntable's speed was off i ran into the same problem at first i tried have the case set up on a shelf with the top of the case sitting against the back of the shelf upright i found out this was because the turntable was rubbing up against the case a bit once i put the turntable on the counter and leaned the top of the case as far back as it could go the record played at its intended speed smoothly your records have to be cleaned regularly to be played without skipping i have a dog who sheds a ton if there's a lot of dust hair particle build up on your record the needle will skip google how to correctly clean your records once i cleaned mine off the needle skipped a lot less often if you're still unsatisfied after cleaning you may need to upgrade to a better needle speakers aren't the best you're spending on an all in one system so there you go it won't be the greatest quality sound the speakers don't have great bass if they did every hit of the kick drum would cause the needle to skip imagine putting a regular turntable on a sub woofer just wouldn't work if i want better sound when using it i line out on the back of the unit to another sound system and get more of the frequency spectrum off my records this way i suppose it's ok if you really don't care about sound quality at all it looks good but that's about it the quality of the player is pretty low all plastic low cost parts it was already skipping the record using it just once so the weight of the needle is all off but the worst part is the built in speakers they are absolutely awful i have standards in my sound quality or i suppose i wouldn't care i wouldn't recommend unless you only care about look and poor sound quality doesn't bother you much i was extremely excited when i first got it it's a beautiful teal it's darker in person and it's small and adorable i fell in love with it as a year old teenage girl who loves listening to records at first i was a little nervous when trying it out for the first time because the record wasn't stable it wobbled but it sounded fine i used it for a week and took really good care of it but then everything started to go bad every single record i play on it sounds extremely warped and just down right awful at first i assumed it was my records so i tested them on my step father's turntable they sounded perfect i tried the crosby again the next day and it still sounded awful i would splurge more on a different brand if you want a good one my stepdad's sounds amazing do not get this record player it sucks i ordered this record player for my daughter but there is some background noise and would not order the same product again it's cute and it does work but not like she was hoping as far as the sound quality this broke the second time i used it very cheap knobs and sound system horrible product i bought this record player a few years ago and i have repeatedly tried to give it chance it does not play your records well i thought maybe my records were warped only to realize that the player just does not function well at all i've bought new records and they play either too fast or skip over and over save your money bought one and had to exchange it because the turntable was running too slow now the same thing is happening to the second one but i think i'm past the time to return it would be a nice player if it worked correctly quality is not a strong suit on this unit but that kind of goes without saying for a record player mine no longer functions properly after having it two week and only using it twice during listening this morning or songs in the speed control decided to go haywire it suddenly jumped to max speed on irs own without any external input now no manipulation of the speed selector has any effect on the playing speed will be sending this back to amazon so they can trash it also a bit disappointing is the fact that it has an audio output on the rear red white rca jacks but when connected through this method which is to utilize an external speakers the on board speakers continue to play i got this as birthday present from my friends and i feel bad that i hate this record player like everyone else is saying this player will skip on brand new records fresh out of the package i would never recommend this piece of junk to anyone and the built in speakers are terrible it sounds like a muffled toy my phone can produce a better quality than these speakers crowley you did me dirty never again this was purchased as a gift it only worked properly for a short while but ultimately started to malfunction slowing down and speeding up for no apparent reason i see that the return timeframe has expired is there something to be done to remedy this my daughter opened on christmas but the record player did not power on a very disappointing christmas gift do not buy this isn't a good player even for just beginners this will ruin your records over time the tracking weight is suuuper high grams the reccomended is grams the speakers are horrendous sounds straight out of a tin can also just dont buy a portable suitcase record player get a stationary one theres no dust cover so it will build up dust and possibly ruin your needle which wont matter but if your needle gets ruined it will even further damage your vinyl record might as well use sandpaper at that point this turntable unfortunately sucks horribly a lot of people are saying the sound is so smooth and nice but my sound is like cats dying i was expecting the sound to be not so sharp but this sound is the worst thing i have ever heard i'm hoping the one i got is just defective and maybe if i exchange it the next one will be better idk all i know is you get what you pay for i suppose crapley crosey brand and similar gimmick turntables are all the worst turntables on the market and destroy your records besides they sound awful i am a record dealer and expert and these are straight junk unless you are playing only beat up thrift store records you don't care about absolutley do not buy a crosley you will thank me ten plays from now when your new record hasn't had it's grooves shredded by the extremely overweighted arm straight junk i love records too much to let them be destroyed on this crap don't waste your money this will ruin your records this piece of junk only worked for months the return date passed and then it broke right after the speakers suck and if you ignore this review and purchase anyway you'll need to buy speakers might as well buy a more expensive turntable with built in speakers i am not happy with this purchase i didn't expect much but an old iphone has way better sound than this thing at least it looks cute in my daughter's room my husband got this for me last year for christmas i was so excited until i put on a record the sound quality is not good sounds like the one i had as a child it is now basically my year old's toy my nephew bought a old turntable from goodwill and it sounds awesome lesson learned plays slow my iphone has better speakers it's cute but that is seriously all it has going for it returned it and am currently using a teac system originally purchased for our daughter the first couple of weeks she was ecstatic now after days the sound is horrible the sound from the speakers is muffled save your money and put it towards something of higher quality lovely living room decor sub standard music quality sound quality isn't the best with the internal speakers i am experiencing skipping problems with certain vinyl especially brand new ones debating on returning it absolute hot chinese garbage i feel sorry for you if this is your introduction to vinyl plastic needle whoever heard of such a thing yes the needle is plastic my record mat and spin plate came warped from the factory the arm is a plastic weightless p o s don't waste your time with this junk first time i use it it doesn't do speed sounds like a chipmunk i would give it zero stars if i could for people getting into vinyl i highly recommend you look for something else these are cheaply made and are absolutely horrendous in quality of sound what people might not realize is that vinyl isn't a cheap hobby so people who think they're gonna get a good turntable for are terribly mistaken if you are a beginner i recommend the audio technica at lp it's about and way better than these pieces of junk for people who want a good turntable you're gonna have to spend at least if that's too much for you then maybe you should find a different hobby stay away from crosley they are complete junk the world of vinyl is a fantastic place and you should invest your money wisely but please just don't buy one of these they are horrible end of story spins too slow huge disappointment trying the byone hopefully have better luck adorable but the sound isn't great if i turn it up too loud it makes the record skip i bought it because aesthetically it was just what i wanted but in hindsight i should have bought something with better speakers horrible product me and of my friends purchased crosleys scratched every vinyl we tried on all turntables purchased save your suffering and buy a numark for around the same price horrible didn't work sound quality is fair but not great or at all what i was hoping it'd be the bottom line is that crosleys are cheap low quality record players and you'd be better off spending the extra dollars to get a really good record player ultimately you'll find in unfixable problems such as skipping and will regret not buying a nicer record player very pretty record player works well but the sound is not as clear as i would like s ty sound it's a cheap record player want my money back it's only that price for its looks it does its job spinning the records but the speakers leave a lot to be desired if you're an audiophile you'll want your own speakers to hook up to this it's cute and sleek though and easy to move around speakers are weak the product was a great gift for my year old who wanted her first record player months later it no longer works it does not hold the speed to play the records and it no longer is returnable a waste of ordered this and it came broken biggest mistake i've made ever to order anything crosley no matter what type of crosley it is it's going to break sooner or later this product was broken when it was finally received do not buy this record player after hearing so much about it i got one to try out at barnes and noble first the audio quality sucks listening to a kb mp is better second i was shocked when i measured the tracking force g normal players have g this is times normal and if you love your records well lets just say that they will be destroyed pretty quickly by this player cheaply made looked adorable but doesn't last long it broke while being shipped to me i went to a shop to have it looked at and they said crosley's are made cheaply and can scratch your records if you're using expensive records i'd spend a little extra and get a better brand to be safe worked for an hour and then died we returned for a more expensive model super disappointed considering all the good things i've heard about crosley this turntable cannot play g vinyls as the weight slows down the motor speed and it plays slower with no speed adjustment this is an issue its fine with older vinyls or those of lower quality but if you have any audiophile gram vinyls as most newer records are this will not work for you i bought it for my girlfriend and it works on all of her old records such as ella fitzgerald and the doors that were printed on lower quality vinyl but any newer vinyls that are heavier simply won't work i received this as a gift for my th birthday after mentioning earlier in the year i would like a record player i'm not crazy about the quality of the built in audio sometimes it comes out grainy or static like however i do like that this little guy comes with a adjuster i also think its cool that you can get an aluminum adjuster in the color of your turntable for more i actually saw these at booksamillion i did some research after i received my crosley portable turntable and found out that crosleys are notorious for their low quality needles this subtly but eventually wears down your vinyl due to this i only play my mainstream vinyl that i can easily replace for tops i do not play my older vinyls that i've collected over years from peddlers malls for great prices because i know it'll be far more for me to replace them for the great deals i got eventually i want to save up and get a nicer setup and have great audio because i love music and i love the original smooth vinyl sound but i have to say if you're only going to be collecting new vinyl and playing it just for the nogalistic feel then i don't think there would be anything wrong with this turntable for you cheap very poor sound quality many people may say that this are too quality record players but to be honest that's a lie the whole thing is madeout of cheap plastic the tonearm is too short scratching the disc there is no counterweight nor anti skate there is no way to control tracking force and the safe tracking force is to this record player tracking force is to making it extremely dangerous to your vynil built in speakers are not good and don't have a good sound quality the part where the disc goes is too small so the disc can shake and scratch overall the record player don't work and being small also affects it yes it may be cheap yes it may be cute and yes it's portable but to everyone who may argue i'm going to say that you deserve better there are tons of record players out there try searching one in between dlls and make sure they are good quality this is such a cute record player but unless you hook it to additional speakers these is a very low sound to it avoid at all costs these turntables not only sound awful but can damage records save your money and pay a little more for something not made of trash if it has that silver tone arm with the red cartridge it's a generic chinese turntable that you are paying too much for the disk doesn't spin flat so my record sound out of tune its a cute fun and portable little record player although you get what you pay for it's still a nice addition for beginners travelers and audiophile collectors but it is definitely not perfect the speakers are weak and will blow out easily i definitely recommend using external speakers with this player the arm is also very light even some of my gram vinyls have a hard time playing on it luckily i have more serious record players but if this is your only one be aware that some of the newer vinyls will still have trouble i do love the record player it's self though i love the design and color i find it very girly for a girly girl like me i also like to take it on road trips and the briefcase style makes it much easier to carry around i also think that it's design is just enough to brighten up a room and would be very good for kids also another thing to know is that there is no preamp in the turntable it's apart of the crosley design to keep the turntable light and at low cost so when using the headphone jack you will need an amplifier or power headphones to get quality sound something to keep in mind if interested in buying this record player so overall i do like this record player and recommend it to the not so serious and beginner collectors just remember the light arm and speaker quality is only so so but a good pair of computer speakers can fix that right up i bought this turntable in books a million and it does not work as well as i thought it would there is nothing wrong with the records that i buy and i make sure to dusk it regularly but it still has very poor quality the sound is horrible it skips parts in the songs and overall it's just not worth the money please save your money to buy a better turntable i bought one and it stopped working within mins i then exchanged it for another one and that one wouldn't even turn on crosley products are so cheaply built it's ridiculous it's too bad because they look good but that's all the color is a bit darker than shown you also have to lean the top of the case quite far back otherwise it rubs up against the record on the turntable and warps the sound it is not very loud either all in all it is very nice with a few flukes which are to be expected with the cheap price lost the spin within months so sad i love my little player really poor quality record player crosley cr a tu cruiser portable speed turntable turquoise i was hoping for a much better sound this record player is cheaply made and will destroy your vinyl does not spin at a constant speed and results in a dull lifeless sound the table spins too fast which makes the music sound higher pitched than usual do not buy any of crosley's products to put it simply this is not a good turntable you've probably read most of the reviews and are confused because of how mixed they are i was the same way but i went out on a limb and just bought this turntable anyway at first i had no problems records played fine and the only problem was the atrocious quality of the built in speakers i honestly don't understand the inclusion of these because they are just not good so i immediately plugged in some better speakers after purchasing more records over the months i noticed that a lot of them would skip sometimes ridiculously i thought it was the records at first but after reading more about it i learned it was the turntable itself simply put since vinyl has become increasingly popular again over the years brands like crosley are trying to cash in and provide a cheap and affordable turntable to consumers well it may suck to hear this but getting into vinyl is not cheap it will cost you a lot for a great quality turntable as well as other accessories such as preamps or receivers and speakers and even the vinyl itself now i know you probably don't want to spend hundreds of dollars for an amazing turntable especially if you're just getting into vinyl and you'd like to keep it as cheap as possible the best thing you can do is avoid this turntable and instead get an audio technica at lp turntable i've had this turntable for quite sometime now and have had a much better experience no records have skipped ever and the quality is a big improvement over this it's only a bit more but trust me when i say it's definitely worth your money if you want to get into vinyl that turntable with a good pair of speakers will be a great beginners setup dynamic speaker it's crap this thing is really basic love the look but it's not built to last upon opening the top hinge was already loose the worst part is the sound i'm trying to find a speaker to plug into this thing to make it sound better audio technica next time i've tried out of these and they both wobble distort and skip i returned some rare records thinking it was a problem in the pressing until i realized it was actually this cheap record player don't waste your money my record player started slowing down after only owning it three months and i can't seem to figure out how to replace or fix it zero stars do not buy it has never worked we bought it for my daughter as a new year gift and it is complete junk we have a playschool player circa that works better and i can't return it it was bought before christmas and given on new year and isn't eligible for return unbelievable wish i could give it negative stars poor sound quality did not rotate at a consistent speed i tried playing several different records all of them wobbled or there would be squeaking from the turn table the sound seemed to be too slow even when set on a higher speed overall it was just a cheap product i recommend splurging a little more for something better i was really excited to receive this record for christmas this past year i love the aesthetic but i soon discovered that every single one of my records had the same warp that made them unbearable to listen to i bought a new record and that record had the same warp at that point it occurred to me that the records are fine so i watched closely and it's the platter of the record player that wobbles i googled it and apparently it's a very common issue with this brand very disappointed horrible unit this must be a box with a decoration we sent one back for the same issue as before it doesn't play records correctly st we thought maybe a bad one two dont buy it we're stuck with it maybe amazon will take it back stars it worked for about two hours and it was really fun for two hours but not worth the hassle to box it up and send it back do not buy this was the worst experience i ever had with a company it broke within months and the maker nor amazon would stand behind it i wasn't able to exchange it or get a refund i was so disappointed believe the hate i know i should have steer clear of this if you're an audiophile like me but new to the vinyl scene or trend or movement or pac of whatever the heck all the trendy ultrahipster kids call it these days i wouldn't know because i was a hipster before it was cool mkay so the only thing this has going for it is that it looks good well great so like nightshade it looks promising but will end up just killing you maybe that's exaggeration but hey hipsters need melodrama too amirite my cruiser came defective right out of the box it produced a horrible squeaking while playing after disassembly i discovered the the spindle had not been fully lubricated after reassembly i was good to go now let's listen to that sweet sweet vinyl sound wow wow this sounds like crap and yes i have it hooked up to my awesome sound system so yeah the problem lies in the player and is the record playing just a tad too slow really i compare against a digital file and wow it's too slow by maybe or so just enough to really irritate the phonically obsessed so i say hey i'm a noob to the vinyl thing maybe i can improve it so i tap into the worldwide knowledge base via my computational device i discover that you can get better needles er stylus to improve the sound etc etc i also come to find out that this cruiser is so heavy with the needle it'll probably ruin my vintage star wars soundtrack from episode iv because the prequels are dead to me before i can even get the diamond stylus on there the player starts to echo like it's trying to win the world cup of marco polo or something i put the diamond stylus on there for fun because hey i got nothing to lose at this point and wouldn't you know it it did sound better now the echo is clear and less grainy so between the echo and under driven belt speed i gave up i gave up so hard now i'm rockin an audio technica at lp for more you'll enjoy the epic performance if you're going to drop on a total piece of garbage you should really consider just spending the for the at lp if you are an audiophile but new to the vinyl whatever then do yourself a big big favor and don't buy this piece of junk try the at lp you won't be disappointed the sound quality was horrible the idiot speller shipped mine to ohio and raised the price so i didn't get a new one human garbage after less then three months the turntable spins noticeably slower i called crosley about it and they ask you to send the unit to them for them to repair or they'll send you a new one shipping is my responsibility both directions to kentucky and they automatically charge for return shipping doubt it'd be worth the for shipping when the unit is only thankfully amazon is standing by their product and allowing me to return it past our return window due to this defect after the issue came up we found out it's a known widespread issue obviously you can't win them all at this price point but if my year old notices it then it's gotta go i will be ordering the audio technica at lp fully automatic stereo turntable system no built in speakers or cute traveling case and hope for better results would give this no stars if i could poor quality got a credit and replaced it with a better crosley bought for my daughter worked okay at first but started to skip then slowed down and eventually died within weeks i'd advise to stay away from this player even after making adjustments it doesn't spin correctly pretty disappointed the sound isn't too great either i originally bought this record playing thinking ok its cheaper than every other player months ago and have had problems with skipping and poor quality audio now i just purchased an audio technica which really is not all that much more than this one and there is a huge difference an unbelievable difference tracks dont skip any more and vinyl sounds great poor performance cheaper model stylish case and very compact the needle is mediocre as it skips rather easily even with the record completely clean from dust lint etc consider connecting to auxiliary speakers for better sound quality the integrated speakers are borderline useless and sounds awful but for the price this is a lot better than other ones i have seen or heard do not buy this if you are looking to truly experience vinyl or analog format music buy a real turntable with an amplifier and speakers do it the right way and not because you want to tell people you have vinyl records don't expect the world with this unit returned this junk record player wanted to get into listening to music on vinyl this record player made my brand new records skip like crazy they don't skip on other players would defiantly not recommend this record player this might not say that i am a verified purchaser because i returned it terrible product the power knob broke weeks after the return window plays slow 's have to be played on setting i got this record player and it was already opened and used by someone else the packaging was messed up and it was obviously used it did not work and it had to be sent back the second one i received was new and packaged properly it's just disappointing that a company would try to pull this over their customers if you're buying this and you receive it new it looks awesome the box is very retro but the sound quality isn't great by any means for the money i would probably buy it again don't buy this it will sound like garbage and damage your records get the atlp instead the cord that came with it was broken we got this product with high expectations but the original one that came did not play at all it was terrible the setting was too slow and adele sounded as crazy as she did at the grammy's we chose to replace it and even the replacement did not work one could say it was like playing a broken record we kept trying but it never worked very disappointing we will not be buying a crosley again ever j u n k this record player is horrible quality for a while we just thought the sounds was wobbly or warped sounding due to our old records so we bought new records and it still sounds warped the quality of this record player is horrible this is a rip off i wouldn't have paid for this if i knew how bad it was going to be it looks cute thats about it even our cat is put off by the horrible sound quality of this unfortunately it is too late for me to return this piece of junk i wish i never bought it and read all the negative reviews on this player buyer beware furthermore if you want to return this for the year manufacture warranty you have to pay to ship it and pay to have it shipped back so basically pay another to get a new record player that probably won't work good job crosley turntable wobbles a lot skips on thicker vinyl and light scratches speaker blown after days plays very slow returned do not waste your money had this for one month played it maybe five times my daughter got it for christmas and the motor went out cannot find any information on repairs and it's too late to return it days too late ours broke after month conveniently passed the window for a return or refund there was no needle horrible sound quality and makes the record sound shaky even though it was a new record cute player but take my advice if you have a large collection and listen to your records everyday spend a little more money and get something better will be returning ours came with no needle but was replaced within a few days fun for a first timer looking to start a casual collection sound is meh and quality is meh no it did not the needle keeps making the records sound off and weird and this has happened with the first crosley i got i am returning this product as there is an obvious defect in the speed settings we have now tried new vinyls and none of the speed options are right we compared playing the records on another player and the speed in the other player was perfect on this crosley the sounds warped it looks so pretty i hoped to love it but sadly the speakers on this are very very bad if you want a record player to listen to on headphones that looks super cute this is it if you want something to play out loud look elsewhere belt was slipping off the deck from day one had to open it up and replace it twice after the third time i gave up on it and decided to send it back to amazon the tiny speakers sound horrible cartridge tone arm and preamp look cheap i guess i shouldn't expect more from a sub deck mediocre record player the built in speakers are awful way too much treble very tinny and sparse sounding you'll need to buy speakers so you can actually hear the bass and more complicated undertones in the music another reviewer pointed out that the platter is to small so all your records seam warped and most won't play properly this is accurate the speeds are off and playback is far too slow listening to 's on this thing is not enjoyable my daughter love it this is ok for a kid and that's about it the speakers are very low and muffled you are better off spending a little more and hooking up some speakers than you are using this nice little novelty piece for kids or someone who is only going to use headphones it is cute it is portable but the sound is lousy the only other portable turntable i've owned was an old radio reproduction and it was purchased from the ad on the back of parade magazine i thought that this would be an upgrade and i purchased it because it was the top rated one this suggests to me that as a whole inexpensive portable turntables are junk truly it isn't worth it and now i never listen to my records the speakers on the one from parade magazine was much better than this one and i got rid of it in a move save your pennies and buy a good one to hook into a stereo system this record player is garbage records are slow built in speakers are terrible rpms aren't consistent leading to a warping sound returned it for a refund if you value sound quality even in the slightest stay away from this piece of junk i didn't think the okay sound quality that other reviewers were inquiring about would bother me but the sound was not even okay my right speaker cracked and buzzed and when i turned it up it only made it worse also it's important to mention that this player could handle older lighter records but not newer heavier ones the needle skipped a lot i sent it back the next day very cute not very loud wouldnt play without skipping having to return i was really excited about this record player i purchased it as a gift for my mother it has such a cute look to it but the sound quality really sucks not worth the money doesn't work that well returning it i have spent a lot of my on my vinyl collection and this player did my records no justice i wasn't expecting much as i knew that this wasn't a huge player but i crossed my fingers and hoped for this best unfortunately this is a dud my records sounded horrible and i found myself playing my records less and less as a result i love the look of this player but that is about all it is good for its look i don't recommend this product at all didn't work but they were very easy to work with and gave me a full refund it literally worked for second and then it just stopped working it's not turning on anymore at all and yes i checked the ac power cord at least times and it's connected i'm very disappointed if you are a record enthusiast do not purchase this product the speakers are not great there is a headphone jack so you can plug in external speakers something i will certainly be doing but the quality of the tiny built in speakers are very muted kind of underwater sounding with that said the best part of this product is the aesthetic it's cute it's small it's portable my only complaint on the look is that the colour is not turquoise it's baby blue tl dr if you are just looking for something cute to listen to vinyls only every so often and you have other speakers you can use with it this works for the money spent if you're looking for high quality sound and equipment definitely look elsewhere this is a piece of scrap the day i got it i felt for the needle and there was a piece of flimsy rubber so the company either broke it off or the ups did but i was not pleased so i threw it back in the box and am returning it my nest friend had the same problems bad audio that you can barely hear and her new records skipped on it i got this product as a christmas gift and it is the worst thing ever as a lot of people are saying it sounds like the sound is just slightly slower than perfect so it drives you insane i put on nocturnal by disclosure and the weeknd featured sounded drunk i would have been able to deal with the crap quality of the speakers i have other speakers that would work great with this player but the sound also sounding lower and warped is not okay do not buy this product spend your money on a better quality one that will work well and last a long time i do not trust crosley at all save up for something better i'm buying one i found on craigslist because it is cheaper than all of the ones i have found on here but there are plenty of options out there that will give you your money's worth i so wanted to like this ugh i really really did it's so cute and so nostalgic but after about uses the speakers just started sounding so gravely and ridiculous you couldn't even use it anymore i mean there's bad quality and then there's this it was shameful absolutely adorable player though and the blue is the nicest color but if you want it for more than looks walk away pros product looks great cons the disc turns very unevenly causing distortion in the sound volume is weak when the lid is open all the way the record ever so slightly hits it while spinning also causing distortion in the sound i got this as a christmas present and decided to return it volume too low dont get this it skips songs so much and can ruin records i'm so upset with this product this is a cute little machine but it's built like crap it worked well for about a week then it sounded slowed down and warped this was a christmas gift for my daughter she was very excited to get it but it has been nothing but a problem she took it to college with her so i couldn't get it back until a month later to send it back that's all amazon gives you for returns amazon is ok until you need to return something they won't help you so you are left dealing with the manufacturer what a joke this will be the last time i buy anything from amazon in today's world there are better online stores they are to big to care about the customer anymore they take your hard earned money sell you a piece of china junk my boyfriend bought this for me as a gift he knew i would probably want to upgrade or buy additional speakers but when we plugged this in we knew it would be going back the sound quality was terrible way worse than what comes out of a cellphone also the music sounded distorted if you want something cute for a kids room this may work for you otherwise you can get something better for your money i received this crosplay turntable as an early christmas present it had been a while since l'd owned a turntable i own a little over a hundred lps and now finally had a player to enjoy them again i was all giddy and smiles as l picked my favourites to play on the first song from the first album l played l noticed some issues but first let's start with the positives on the plus side this is a relatively small and compact turntable it's as portable as it gets and it looks great it's charming classy and convenient the choice of colours it is available in is astounding it offers all the functions of a traditional record player at an affordable price and reads s s and s being able to link an lpod or mp player is a great addition you'll get a lot of aw from people when they first glance at it it plugs and plays straight out of the box no installation or effort required on your part it's a cute record player and it would look great as a decorative accessory that's all the positive l'm afraid you buy a record player it's primarily function should be to play records the rest comes second there are a few setbacks as cute and affordable as the player is it simply doesn't play records as well it should the vinyls tend to skip it's usually not by a huge amount of time but it's certainly noticeable and disconcerting i tested it with both old records and fresh out of the wrapper ones and l can safely say it's not due to the condition of the records themselves i wondered if it was the needle but nothing seems wrong on that end i read of other reviewers' experiences where the needle would drag along the record but it didn't do that to me yet the real problem lies in the flawed design of the crosplay table the briefcase design as efficient and portable as it may be is not fitted to play the larger records the records tend to hit against the inside of the briefcase and cause skips you can try and stretch the case as far as you may nada niet it will still be ineffective they still skip if this doesn't happen due to occasional wobbling and other reasons i read about some people making it work with a quarter but sadly the old quarter on the arm trick didn't work for me not every record skips but in my experience with this player usually about half the albums played will whether in small or significant way what's strange is that there's a higher frequency of skipping on new records than old ones i decided to read some reviews on the crosley cruiser and saw that l wasn't the only one experiencing problems the amount of people who returned received a deffective product is astounding maybe it was too good an offer to believe but playback issues ruin an otherwise great product it's a beauty it sounds decent enough even without speakers but it skips far too much for my taste definitely style over substance in this case as it stands l still play this records on this turntable but it seems inevitable that l'll have to replace it and invest in something better i suggest you do the same in retrospect if you're looking to play that one record you may never listen to again or use it as a decoration it could work if you're looking for a legit affordable record player to play your collection this isn't it i was also disappointed reading some of the comments regarding this product and thought well maybe it'll work for me it didn't save your money and invest in a more expensive player because here you get exactly what you pay for stars out of the box on christmas morning with brand new albums it didn't spin at a consistent rate fast and slow and it sounded like well you know what i'm talking about this is a very cute record player very cosmetically pleasing other than that very poor sound doesn't get very loud and only one of the speakers work i got this turntable for my daughter for christmas and we opened it to play her new beatles albums and all the needle does is slide across the albums the best thing about this so far is the case that it comes with this is the worst turntable ever made do not buy one it worked for a little while the records now all sound warped loved it but the turntable stopped turning working after a couple months total junk returned the first one second rotated records just as wobbly should have gone with a fischer price model f minus after a few months i am having trouble getting it to start to play an album the item looks really good and it's pretty cool but the speaker sound quality is not that good so i am pretty dissapointed do not buy this turntable even i bought this at a discounted price i still regret my purchase it worked for the first time then began skipping songs like crazy at first i thought it's my record but it wasn't it was because this turntable is so poorly made and gets slower over time save your money and invest in better quality turntable this player is okay for the price you get what you paid for it i thought it would have a more vintage look but it kind of just looks like a cheap turn table the built in speaker quality is about a out of but much better when you plug in extra speakers that are good quality it's also not turquoise at all it's little blue which was very disappointing my friend got a vinyl player from urban outfitters a while back and played it for me it was amazing and i knew i needed one i got the vinyl player and goes with the alternative theme for my room but the second i put the vinyl on it was terrible the speakers are of the worse quality i have ever seen the only way we thought to fix it was adding speakers but it took away from the vintage feel i wouldn't spend my money on this it works but not good enough for me i used it exactly times even considering this isn't a serious record player the sound was terrible even with accessory speakers added after that it just stopped working completely i unscrewed the unit to see if wires had come loose inside and was shocked by the very poor quality of the way it was constructed complete waste of money don't make the same mistake the first one we bought died after weeks returned it to amazon and got a replacement then it died after months of light use avoid this product i bought this for my daughter a few weeks before her birthday after she had chosen this specific brand and color she did not play any records until later and by then more than the days return window had passed the platter was warped and i can't return it although the price was reasonable the quality was questionable crosley cr a tu cruiser portable turntable turquoise albums skip first week used it my child wasted her hard earned money on this faulty product nothing like the original crosby of the past i would not recommend this record player i bought one last year and i was so excited to get my first record player i set it up and got ready to play my brand new record it skipped horribly and the record was completely new so that didn't make sense to me i tried another new record and the same thing happened i thought maybe my records might be scratched so i took them to my boyfriend's house to see if they would work on his record player they worked perfectly and weren't warped or scratched at all i sent this record player back and saved up money to buy one that actually works crosleys are crap don't waste your money now i know what you all are thinking how can he possibly know what he's talking about if he hasn't bought the product yet i was looking for some records and came across this so i thought i'd just let you guys know what you're getting into if you bought this i saw one being demoed at the mall a few days earlier and long story short you can tell the table wasn't spinning at the proper speed also i'd like to add that the build is extremely fragile and you could very easily break the thing if you're not careful the demo guy accidentally did anyway like everyone else here is saying do not cheap out on a turntable you get what you pay it is much better to save up for a very good set up than to go through multiple lower quality ones before finally settling on a decent one also the more you invest on higher quality products the longer your vinyls will last i will say though the only good thing about this product is how adorable it looks the only reason i'm giving this product a two star review is cause it is aesthetically pleasing i recently bought this album and let me say that i am not pleased with the results the speakers are horrid and it constantly skips on the first couple of tracks i thought it was the albums which were perfectly new and unused however after playing it on a friends without a single skip and multiple reviewers having the same problem i have come to the conclusion that this turntable is terrible do not buy the record player was shipped missing the ac power adapter luckily i had a spare to test the product overall it is an aesthetically good looking record player the sound of the speakers is average one star rating due to the player missing it's power source i mean really how does a product miss the most essential component of it's package sound was awful sounded distorted and'wonky' very cute though so that was disappointing wanted a all in one player but i guess none of the all in one's have good sound at all too bad don't waste your money this is a toy not a turntable the needle slides across the records due to poor tone arm assembly and crude stylus assembly it will do harm to your vinyl collection the speaker is not very loud and the top of the case does not fully open the turn table looks very cool though great color do not buy this makes your records sound wonky do not buy the player works fine the overall volume is not pretty loud but it does have audio ports on the back if you wanted to plug it into a speaker or sound system but if you don't have one available you can really only use it if you're next to it in a quiet environment one issue i had with it was the lid in order to play the large vinyls you have to open the lid pretty wide since there are no rubber mounts on the back to secure the lid in this position the lid must rest on the power cord this bends the cord and could break it over time luckily i quickly solved this problem by going to home depot and finding some rubber things in the plumbing section which i could glue on to the rear of the player the player does have a headphone jack which i think is great but just the needle running over the vinyl creates a little noise so don't think using headphones eliminates all sound i highly recommend this player if you're willing to make a quick trip to home depot but considering the quality and price of the item i think it was worth it everything sounds too slow especially in rpm and the actual sound from the speakers is really bad have to hook it up to good speakers all the time works well does what its supposed to do speakers good have been better for less than who can complain i purchased this player for my daughter's birthday the morning after her birthday and no more than hours after opening from the box it began to show audible signs that the turntable mechanism was faulty with horrendous amounts of wow and flutter a term us old audiophiles used to geek out about i had bought this two months ahead of time and by the time it was opened it had passed its return date hats off to amazon after a short chat session with a customer service agent i was given a link to a return label returning it today for a refund and will look for another model bya different manufacturer in general without the wow and flutter it sounded as if this were a grammophone playing wax cylinders seems as though problems began to arise after playing a few times working record player but not much more needles hard to find and it is prone to scratch your records needle does not pick up or set down automatically this is a great looking record player which unfortunately doesn't work we sent the first one back then the replacement didn't work either very disappointing never buy any crosley made turntable or anything else they make for that matter worst quality junk on the market mine was hardly used and still broke on it's own one day output amp died there stuck looks all cool and vintage but it is terrible quality the on board sound is like the worst transistor radio from you have been warned mine arrived damaged so i had to return it looks great granddaughter was thrilled however it broke almost immediately just stopped working the turn table worked really well for me the first time when i played my new record arctic monkeys album but then it started skipping in the songs when it played i'm not quite sure if it was the needle but it did the same thing on a white crosley turn table my friend bought around the same time and we both have been trying to figure it out a theory might be that the needle can't handle dust on the record very well or it's an electrical problem but i'm pretty sure it's the needle also the leather where the corners meet is slowly coming apart i've been really gentle with it too but i just fixed that with some gorilla glue but all in all once i get the skipping problem fixed it's not a bad turn table to own the speaker works fine but has a lot of noice the lid touches the edge of the record and slows down the speed if it isn't all the way open i did not buy this from amazon but i'm returning it tomorrow the speaker just sucks if you plug in a headphone it's even worse buy it if you want this thing to ruin your ears we bought this for my daughter for her birthday in july she turned she played it times with the new albums she got for her birthday she went to listen to some more new albums she bought and it didn't work the turntable would not turn i went to replace this item and i was literally days from the last chance date that i had to return this item not happy at all now she is upset did not play at a constant speed the speakers don't work after lengthy back forth i'm sending it back to the manufacturer for repair had to return it because the speakers didn't work i've not even had it for half a year and i can no longer play new or old records on it the second you turn on the power the table spins and spins before you even pick up the needle and the needle itself has already somehow broken this has brought more trouble than it was worth please please please don't buy this product crosley is known to have warped turn tables and this one is no exception i fell in love with the vintage look and gave into the player but it's horrible the player also ruined a few of my vinyls the speakers also sound muffled and make the music sound really bad please don't buy this no matter how alluring it is skips like hell and the turntable is so uneven with the rpm adapter that the sounds warps don't buy this or any crosley honestly have to put a nickel in the arm to keep it from skipping old trick inconvenient and kinda ugly but it works won't play new records with original needle will need to buy a new elliptical needle which are hard to come by for this style of player had to return due to poor quality it would skip frequently on new albums when the player was brand new i was generally disappointed with the unit sound was only so so i am looking for a turntable with better quality and sound i guess you get what you pay for and if i want better quality then i need to pay for it way smaller than i expected the sound is not the best but works cheap piece of junk just chucked my crosley turntable into a trash bag after years of use completely stopped working had to buy numerous extra needles the quality of this product is horrible i will never buy a product from this company again and crosley should be ashamed to sell such a piece of trash total waste of money okay let me start out by saying i'm not super knowledgeable when it comes to record players i'm just speaking about my experience with this product if you're looking for something for casual listening or you're just starting to get into vinyl then this record player is a good choice however the comments stating you get what you pay for are completely true in this case the record player does skip on vinyls whether they're new or old i tested it with a few different records and it would jump around regardless of the record's condition the speakers are okay for the price but you can always plug in some other speakers to it which i highly suggest overall though if you're justing starting out then this is a good product you can always invest in a better quality one later was in love with this little handy player until this week suddenly died on me with the light still on had been acting a bit wonky the night before play quality had been slowly declining unscrewed the board to take a look at the guts thinking there was a loose connection this is literally held together with hot glue poor secured wiring and hot glue dripping from when pieces were attached i'm disgusted no care seems to have been taken with this product speakers are on but motor will not turn lasted me less than months super bummed not amazons fault should have listened to reviews we purchased two records which wobbled we thought the records were warped during shipment turns out the turntable wobbles no fix for the issue my kids like it and for the price it looks and sounds decent well it gets the job done it plays records does it play them well nope but it plays them occasional skips muffled sound just not great but for the price it is i guess that's fair the only confusing part is when connected to good speakers it still sounds muffled and it's not the record itself because all of my records sound this way on it that's what makes me want to give this stars the product works fine for what i wanted at the time i had nothing to play records on and no place to put any new piece of technology at home this one went with my decor was portable which was helpful in my tiny place and was basically plug and play so it met that need it does seem a bit sensitive i didn't expect great sound and i don't have great sound one time i plugged it in and it wouldn't power up but simply unplugging everything and plugging it back in worked i tried using headphones but the sound didn't completely go off on the unit while playing in the headphones i decided to try to connect it via aux to my sister's jawbone speaker it played fine for a while and then i noticed the sound didn't completely go off the unit i saw the aux connector wasn't completely in the socket so i pushed it in all the way then the turntable wouldn't spin after two hours of trying to troubleshoot i realized quite by accident that it wouldn't turn if the aux was completely in so i have to let it hang out a bit the manual's troubleshooting section was laughable to say the least same goes for the online crosley troubleshooting faqs anyway i can hear my records and i've had it several months so with my light wear and tear it seems it will hold up fine i do think i will have to quickly determine a new entertainment set up because i want my records to last long in good condition and i think i'll be an audiophile when i grow up i'm quickly learning that my first purchases this included weren't the best for my long term goals sad that the turntable we purchased for our daughter started working very poorly a couple of months after purchase will spend more next time and never buy a crosley again i was so excited to receive this product because i intended on taking it to college with me however none of my brand new records would play on it without skipping i tried the same records on my friend's turntable and they worked perfectly this is a complete waste of money and i would not recommend it to anyone beautiful to look at and good turntable volume quite low even when turned to maximum sound quality ok this is a terribly manufactured product with low reliability purchased for my daughter's birthday in march broken by may the mechanism that starts the platter spinning started to not automatically kick in when raising the arm after a few days of use a couple of months later and now it doesn't work at all what is worse amazon said it was out of warranty and i contacted the manufacturer via their customer service website and did not even get a single response stay away from this lousy product and manufacturer i wasted over on it and more than that it really disappointed my daughter you would think it wouldn't be too hard to make a basic record player these days got this as a gift for a friend who is just starting out with records had to return it i don't know much about records but i'm pretty sure they're not supposed to skip half the song and sound like they're being played underwater to be honest i expected it to have a little better quality i didn't really read reviews before buying this product but i can't really afford a more expensive player anyways for the price this isn't so bad my largest complaint is the built in speakers it isn't very loud and i think that takes away from the quality of the sound once it is plugged into speakers it sounds better but it takes away from the vinyl sound and i may as well just be playing songs from my phone to the speaker the plus side is it looks pretty cool and i am enjoying the novelty of playing vinyl records if you are a serious music person this isn't right for you but if you just want it for the looks this player looks awesome and will do just fine this record player worked great for the first month or two but then it started skipping scratching and playing my records too slow the music was off key and a lot slower than it should've been i would not recommend getting this since it ruined basically all of my records very disappointed since i loved the color i thought this was really cool looking my son really wanted it but now that we have or should i say had it it has a terrible platform the records play as if they are warped and the needle skips all the time in addition the sound is much worse than what you can play thru your computer speakers do not recommend this your kids will want this but option for the craigslist receiver turntable and speakers for a little more than x the cost and really listen to music trust me we just finished our new purchase and my son could not be happier this record player quit working after months this thing fracking sucks like seriously the needle doesn't play half my vinyls so i had to get a new needle which also didn't play it so i had to put a weight on the new needle also the rubber thing at the bottom warps all my vinyls so they all sound super crappy and the thing dips every five seconds and the song slows down so it makes all the records i've played more that or times sound terrible and completely ruins the point of vinyls in the first place honestly this thing has been a freaking nightmare honestly i've spent more money replacing vinyls this piece of crap ruined than if i had bought a better quality turntable do not waste money on this piece of poop skips every seconds i bought this radio for my girlfriend for her birthday she and i were both disappointed when we tried playing our vinyl collect we tried both new and old records neither would work so this turntable looks great but did not work when we opened it out of the box something is wrong with the switch the adapted to plug it into the power source is fine but the switch is not however since we did not open it until past days of receiving it was a gift for my son we are stuck with a broken record player it's an ok little player definitely poor sound quality but i just hooked it up to a portable speaker and it sounds great sometimes it seems to play a little slow but decent for the money spent not a bad little record player at all for the price if it had a louder speaker and a better needle i would give it stars sound quality is actually pretty bad other than that the style is awesome sorry looks good but sound is so disappointing you want to believe it's good but remember this you get what you pay for'''' just save your time and money bought this player for my daughter for christmas and by march it stopped working and i cannot return it as the deadline has passed out the window i was given this record player as a gift for my birthday along with some records from my dads collection and or so of my own at first it worked great it sounded great and i used it all the time after about months i couldn't play my newer records anymore twenty one pilots taylor swift but i still could play all my old beatles and pink floyd now it won't play them at all and when i say won't play them i mean the records skip because the needle sucks i regret picking this record player out and i advise anyone i know not to get one this is the nd unit first unit purchased broke the needle came out of the tonearm after about hours of use and would not go back in exceedingly low quality i called crosley to see if they could send a new cartridge while they were very friendly they said they could not do that with this unit and recommended sending the entire unit back to amazon the second unit has been in use for about hours with no issues the sound quality is about as good as listening to music on your phone speaker but my year old daughter loves it nonetheless we broke out all of my old vinyl and she's been playing them frequently i wish the speakers were a little better but its cute and it does the job record player seems warped it doesn't spin straight all of my records skip on this player maybe i received a lemon either way i won't be purchasing a crosley again if you're buying it for the sake of saying i own a record player this is just the thing for you however if you care about the quality of music coming from the internal speakers don't bother it is quite horrible i just got my crosley but the aux input is not working i've tried everything but there is no sound at all what should i do returned twice faulty ac adapter bought at b n today turntable stopped turning almost immediately power was on appears to have a short in the arm going back tomorrow and won't buy another one from this company i don't know if it was just my experience with it but it had very low audio quality and constantly skipped also the headphones did not work at all the pt is broken the sound is not as great as the players from my youth i bought this for my teenage granddaughter also you cannot preload for automatic playing of more than one recordl ac adaptor does not work i bought a replacement for player works so far but it's only its second record do not buy this christmas gift for my fianc broke after three months of minimal use this item didn't last months it started to sound bad after days we should have returned it immediately do not buy this turn table spend a little more money and get something that will last nd one ive ordered the st one didnt work and this one stopped working after weeks gift for my daughter and she hasnt had the chance to truely enjoy it this product was not the best we set it up and used it a few times and it stopped working the records began to be wobbly and the sound become distorted with only uses if you just want a record player to accent your cute apartment because you are going through a 'neat vintage' phase then this is the player for you if you want function pick anything else immediately out of the box this was skipping for seemingly no reason at all i tried several albums some of which were brand new i tried placing it on a more level surface i tried replacing the needle i even exchanged it the new one had the same problem such a waste of my time luckily amazon is pretty good about returns for prime stuff at least i went and dug one from the s out of my grandma's attic got it a new needle and it works great my recommendation go to goodwill spend and spend the other on some speakers and a aux converter best of luck d the ac adapter is bad i bought a me one this machine is complete garbage we bought one it played some records wonderfully while others skipped you could watch the needle slide over half a song called crosley they sent a replacement needle still no go we thought it was the records but soon we had a huge pile of records that wouldn't play we finally took the nonplaying records to another player of a different brand they played beautifully then re called crosley explained the results their advice was to return for new player which we did and it still didn't work the manager at the store who was wonderful literally took different crosley players out more cruisers collegiate advance along with different records that wouldn't play at home she opened everything brand new the only one that played was the collegiate and after several hours we figured out the arms on the others were not heavy enough to play certain records after only three uses my records now wobble and sound terrible this is supposed to be a portable player it has been sitting on a table with the top closed since i received it it has never been moved or jostled in any way yet three record parties later it no longer works unacceptable crosley very disappointed tried several different records and adjusted the settings and it had a terrible skipping problem that could not be resolved returned base is wobbly very disappointed it couldn't play any of my records which are all brand new loved the look of this player but it made all of my albums sound warped the quality was horrible i was really disappointed i was able to play records before it stopped working it worked well for about days then it started to slow down and now a few weeks later it has slowed down a full rpms do not buy the disc player has a super cute design a modern color is portable and has an affordable cost my first impression of the product was great but gradually i noticed that there are two serious problems in it there device incompatibility with new disks of grams the needle or device when play new discs not the old records jump the tracks this has happened with two discs that i bought recently and still spent ashamed to require the exchange of one of the disks to the seller that is if you give chance may be that you can not hear the track on the disc you love most my complaint is not only the material damage but also the moral and personal frustration damage the player has rca output which apparently seemed to me it was just plug it into a common sound box and everything would be ready however the manufacturer reports that the rca output is passive what does it mean you have to buy a speaker with built in amplifier or can not hear any sound i wanted to love this so much the look is perfect and when it started to play the sound was okay but the power knob broke after minutes literally minutes not exaggerating in the slightest this was such a highly anticipated birthday present as well so very disappointed seriously why do people buy this junk it looks 'cool' but it's just ruining the records you bought plus it sound like garbage wake up people stop creating landfill played records slightly slow out of the box and skipped a lot this is a piece of junk the power adapter that came with it didn't work records wobble back and forth and constantly skip while playing the speakers are just about the the weakest dullest poorest quality speakers i have ever heard i am telling you do not buy the crosley cruiser you will regret it we sent ours back immediately and decided to buy an audio technica at lp instead which is only dollars more this is my advice to anyone reading this connect speakers to your turntable do not rely on internal speakers because seriously they are absolutely horrible i bought this record player for my daughter for christmas it is junk dont buy it first day christmas day my daughter tried to play a record and you could barely hear it so my husband called crosely they said it was the needle they sent us a new needle it took two weeks to get that needle but the needle on and could hear the music but it was turing way to fast it sounded like the chipmunks were singing and it was on the correct speed so we tried a different record it played half of the song then nothing no sound was coming out so i called crosely again told them the problems they told me to send it them so they could fix it i didnt agree with them i didnt feel like i should pay shipping to send it back to them but oh well three weeks later we receive what appeared to be a new unit and it played one album now it wont play without skipping and it will just stop i gave one star because you have to otherwise i wouldnt give any and dealing with crosely customer service sucks honestly it looks better than it sounds my boyfriend got me this record player for christmas i was super excited since it's my first one it sounded fine for about a month then started malfunctioning afterwards spontaneously i hadnt even taken it outside i'm extremely disappointed seeing as it's really cute and portable but i'd honestly spend an extra for a better brand the first turntable that i ordered from this company was broken upon arrival however the return was handle with no problems the second unit is acceptable for its price the quality of the materials resembles a toy more than an actual turntable but i guess it is good for casual use i was very disappointed i put my record on and anticipated wonderful sound i got very little sound even when i turned the sound up all the way there was nothing i am returning this record player unable to manually adjust speed so everything was slightly out of tune like nails on a chalkboard for musicians to try to listen to it's already broken i've had it for a month i thought this was a good turntable until i became more versed in the vinyl world newer records are being made heavier so a lot of the new records i bought such as arctic monkeys couldn't be played on this turntable it skipped every song and sounded just plain awkward i originally reviewed this as stars but now that i know better this sucks it might be cheap but putting in the money for a really good turntable makes it all worth it gets the job done wish i bought a stationary so i'd get less wobble from the lp's stopped working after months and i cannot return or exchange because it's passed the day warranty i wanted something small and portable knowing full well that this wouldn't be anything close to what an audiophile would use right from the start this has skipped terribly i can't even get through a track without it skipping and the sound is coming through distorted after testing quite a few records this is going right back to amazon i should have trusted my gut this was too good to be true i wasn't expecting too much from this spin some records for my year old daughter it was cute sounded tinny but she was happy played it for a day or two before we put on a new g record this is quickly becoming the norm for new records and this turntable could not keep spinning at consistent speed thought it might be a dud so exchanged it for another one same issue i returned it and bought an at lp instead and since it has a built in preamp we are just running it through an old pair of computer speakers sounds better and no issues with playback the crosley is exceptionally cute but cute is worthless of it doesn't work it's packed really well and shipped fairly fast also it's super cute i can't comment on the quality though because the first day i received it it totally did not turn on i checked every power outlet every plug nothing was wrong so the product was definitely faulty it's such a hassle to exchange or refund so i shall continue to try and fix this by buying another power cord or wth i don't know but that's definitely a let down sound is extremely bad and scratched one of my brand new records within minutes it's basically a toy player and not meant for serious listeners it does the job if you're a teenage girl trying to be trendy and cute would not recommend at all like other users have said the playback speeds are never truly consistent so the sound is really distorted there is also a good deal of skipping i'm guessing because of the weight of the arm i got this turntable as a gift and i feel too bad to ask my friend to return it but if i'd bought it for myself i'd certainly have sent it back it's a good price sure but what's the point if everything sounds like crap for its size and setup i really liked it when it worked but a piece of it somehow melted and then it started playing everything warped i've had the thing less than a year junk absolute junk gave this to my wife for christmas she used it the day after to play some 's then out it away got it back out today and it won't play at all the arm skips across albums and you can't keep it from doing so great christmas gift didn't realize it was a one day item this turntable is ok i got on thursday and it worked fine come saturday days later it started skipping tracks on brand new records i took the records to a friend's much more expensive setup and the record worked fine on his turntable i returned mine a few hours ago and plan on buying another model i would not recommend this model i i did not purchase the crosley cruiser from amazon but the review here may help others this player like a few other crosley models are sitting right next to vinyl displays at various retail outlets so if you're like me and have a teen who's discovering vinyls like they are something new you'll be tempted to grab this player when you buy her his first few albums please fight the temptation as these units are complete rubbish if the album is not completely flat or if it is not in pristine condition or if the sun and moon aren't in perfect harmony the album will not play well or at all the players are toys and either never work well or work with only a handful or perfect albums your teen will be bummed and you'll think maybe it's the stylus so i'll buy a new one for and swap it out good luck with that first it's a thought of desperation that a brand new player might require a new stylus second you'll likely never get the old stylus off without breaking the arm in the process the only thing a crosley player has is built in speakers which sound tiny with zero bass don't let this fact or the cool retro packaging trick you into buying it you'll be so much happier purchasing an audio technica at lp this player is well built has an automatic start stop arm and sounds great all you'll need is a separate pair of powered speakers such as a pair of powered computer speakers some reviewers have purchased bose computer speakers dayton powered speakers or in my case i simply plugged the at lp into my bose soundlink mini's aux input now my teen can toggle between listening to vinlys or streaming bluetooth from her cellphone good luck with whatever you decide but my experience with crosley was dismal horrible the device won't start or turn on i expected better quality completely dissapointed i've never actually written a review on amazon before but i thought that this was needed i got this as a christmas present from my parents and i was very excited to use it i followed the instructions on how to put it together and i followed everything it said the audio quality wasn't great when it started but i was just happy to have a turntable as i listened to my brand new records after about minutes the songs were skipping and the records sounded terrible i looked in the information i was given and i couldn't find any troubleshooting that would help i checked the directions multiple times and i couldn't find anything that i did wrong then i went online and saw all of the bad reviews on amazon and on other sites i am thoroughly disappointed with this product i hope to find another turntable to play my records on this has skipped on all songs since i bought it at first i thought it was my records but it skips on the same place even on my new records the sound has gotten worse with every use i am trying to contact amazon for a new one since all of the reviews say that crosley has terrible customer service this record player has been an absolute nightmare i bought it as a gift for christmas and i've had to exchange it three times each one that i have received has been broken in some way the first two record players had broken motors that simply wouldn't turn on the last and final one that i will be trying warped all the records that i played on it it was a gift so i have been persistent in exchanging them because i didn't want to replace the gift with something i would not recommend this also i was very disappointed in crosley's customer service they very little help with troubleshooting and every time i called they essentially said that this happens to their record players often and to buy another one that isn't helpful and this shouldn't be something that happens consistently they need some better quality control as i've seen hundreds of reviewers on this site have experienced similar problems didn't even turn on low quality performance but a good way to introduce vinyl to your kids the needle skates on some newer records we had to tape a nickel to the tone arm i got this as a gift for christmas from my mom even though i already had a decent turntable i used to listen to vinyl as a kid in the early to mid 's before cd's became popular during my high school years in the 's so my mom bought this for me knowing i wanted to play all my vinyl records again this thing is very cheaply made all records skip and the speakers distort i had to weigh down the arm with a quarter because it was way too light and flimsy on low volume this thing sounds ok but this isn't made to be played loud not audiophile quality i wouldn't recommended this even though it looks retro from the 's power cord was broken when we received product you could send a replacement power cord if you would to make this product work makes records skip poor quality the first one had to be returned because it did not work the second one had to be returned because the pad was warped it was very disappointing speakers did not work honestly this put me off from any crosley products trust me spend the extra money to get a better one i sent mine back looked awesome as i was unpacking it but as soon as i plugged it in and tried to operate it carefully following the instructions in the booklet it just wouldn't operate the power light turned on for a brief second and then went out very quickly the power switch is clearly broken it does not click as you turn it as it should and upon closer inspection there was dried glue stuck to the insides of the blue leather lining in the lid and the screws holding the black board down were all loose the black board is also chipped and there is a small stain on the canvas in the lid of the briefcase part aside from the obvious damages it doesn't work at all and because i live in australia even if i send it back now in order to get a refund exchange it won't arrive in time for me to get either unless i pay more than the actual turntable in postage fees there is no way to contact the seller i just threw away on a turntable that is completely faulty and doesn't operate and the various damages to the item indicate it has been constructed very poorly i actually think it might be a counterfeit don't risk it for a basic turntable works well speaker is very poor so you need to connect an external b we returned drive motor was out of whack stopped working well after about a dozen plays a seamless return but sour experience with crosley products we purchased the jensen jta speed stereo turntable and have been happy so far very disappointed product arrived with a crack in the inside poorly made junk for the money this turntable caught my eye solely because of the color and i thought it would be a fun hobby to take part in that being said the overall appearance is fantastic i like how it looks sitting on my bookcase and everything seemed fine until i tried to play records on it i figured out the hard way that the player must be sitting on an absolutely flat surface no exceptions or the wires do not contact in such a way that works i scratched a record figuring this out the speed settings on the player are nice but kind of wonky you have to move the lever to a certain spot for the record to not sound like its pitch is constantly changing another godawful flaw of this cheap turntable the needle and arm are very lightweight flimsy even i was disappointed to hear that the needle wasn't making contact with the other speaker so only one side gave sound until i added a little bit of tape to give the arm some more weight the last thing i'll mention is that the speakers in this thing are very finicky it defeats the purpose having speakers on front when i have to plug in an external set of speakers to be able to enjoy my records fully but used as is the speakers sound like ones you would typically find on a cheaply made children's toy those facts taken into consideration i overall do not hate the product but i don't absolutely love it either it takes some diy fixing up and some electronics knowledge to figure out what's going on inside the darn thing when it doesn't work correctly i would not recommend this to anyone seriously looking to get invested into records however it does make a nice gift for children or teens who will probably just use it every now and then and use it as a decorative piece i love the look of this record player and was so excited when it arrived however there was an issue with the speakers and the sound was barely audible even at full volume i returned it and ordered the exact same one a second time assuming that the first problem was just a fluke the second one just arrived and is again defective this time the record player won't even turn on and does nothing at all needless to say after two very disappointing experiences with this brand i'll be going with a different brand that can deliver a functioning product there are obviously other customers that have had a satisfying experience with this record player but based on my two disappointing experiences i would not be able to recommend them to anyone i ordered this for a christmas gift for my niece the turntable wouldn't turn i ordered another unit and the same thing happened the turntable didn't turn i would not recommend this company to anybody while it is cool in appearance it skips on most records because of its very poor build quality tried many brand new records on two different units before returning all skipped sound was weak as expected for the speaker size but aux output could have made it acceptable if not for the skipping like many others i got this as a christmas gift the cute color and portability were appealing attributes while aesthetically pleasing this player is the worst it skipped on all my records from brand new vinyl to unscratched vintage records i tried all the trouble shooting methods recommended by crosley and still had a horrible record player that was skipping and wobbling all over the place thankfully amazon has an excellent return process and i got a full refund i've since purchased a sony record player for about more it's not a cute color but it plays all my records without skipping sadly we had to pack up the portable record player and return it the crosley was a gift for my daughter for christmas and she could not have been more excited about it but after playing a hand full of record albums that she received the turntable began to turn at a slower rate than rpm i noticed it right a away it had so much promise others may have had better luck but not us i ordered this record player and i fell in love with it but soon i started noticing skips on brand new never played records and i started getting annoyed and it arrived cracked i dont understand why i didnt dig deeper and actually read some of the bad reviews they were all true this record player is driving me mad pls dont buy it this thing was cheap so i don't know why i'd believe i'd get a good quality machine the sound quality is terrible and it doesn't get very loud save yourself the trouble very disappointed with this turntable the sound quality is only tolerable when the volume is up all the way and even then it's still only semi decent the headphone jack doesn't work at all i've tried it with different pairs of headphones with the same outcome only static comes through the headphones and the music still plays from the regular speakers just a bit more muffled than the usual sound quality already is i also feel that certain parts of this turntable are made with very cheap flimsy plastic and have the potential to break easily i was very excited to finally receive this and it ended up being an utter disappointment you can definitely find a much better turntable for the same price this record player is so cute it's a shame that it's not that great the needle skates across records and it has problems not skipping i bought the audio technica and it's awesome i wish i could say better things i was really excited about it fast shipping but the item was cracked for the it's worth it i like the vintage look the color turquoise is fun reminds me of the record player i had as a kid can't say the sound is fantastic but it's ok and for what i want it for just to occasionally hear my old albums when i'm sitting around it's fun and easy not a lot of cords plug ins laying around plus looks good on my table skips with all vinyls it came on time and looked great but i can't quite tell if it is playing my vinyl at the right speed seems like it could have a timing issue sounded tinny cheap the speakers stink somewhere in the geo metro realm if speakers were based on a rating system of luxury cars i rarely purchase things with less than stars and more than reviews but i let the superficial aspects of this win me over i swear i will never do this again both packaging and likeness to pictures get an a so if that's what you're interested in you won't be disappointed everything else is a train wreck i don't consider myself picky about super quality sound half of my records are old and scratched and pretty bad anyway but these speakers sound blown even at half volume and dead flat i have one record that plays flawlessly every other record skips at the slightest bit of static because the needle is so poor and some records even sound warped if i was into making people uncomfortable with warped sounding records and questionable of my financial purchases this would blow them away but since i'm not this is truly the worst thing i have ever purchased from amazon if you've never owned a record player this is such a horrible starter please reconsider i bought a defective jensen for before this one and it sounded and worked wonderfully until it stopped working i still prefer it to this gorgeous player very cute and compact sound quality is pretty mediocre does not play at quite the right speed no matter what setting you are on plays well enough to hear the songs just sound is always a little irritatingly off would have returned it if it wasn't such a bother i still use it a lot i just wish it worked a little better also the headphone jack doesn't work at all nothing happens when you plug headphone in not a great turntable had to return every record we tried skipped it was stopping playing music for no apparent reason on off which is frustrating causes the records to wobble and therefore causes the sound to drag neat concept but not efficient bad ones i knew it would be junk but my daughter wanted it first one came without a needle i called crosley they will send a needle out in days so i decided to send it back to amazon of course amazon has great customer service got refund no problem ordered another one and the power adapter was no good i had a similar adapter and tried it just as i suspected it sounds like crap so i called crosley again this time for an adapter and they said to return it to amazon don't expect crosley customer service to be bubbly and with any kind of personality if you call them they all sound like they worked there when the turntable was invented unfortunately my daughter thinks that it sounds good so i just ordered another one i wont return the second one until the third comes so maybe we can make one that works from the parts of two if they insist on selling crap like this it probably should be at a price point it's a cute looking rig and i thought i was getting a good deal on a starter level product but it completely crapped out after only a week or so of light listening it skips terribly and has horrible sound quality i'm incredibly frustrated with the fact that i now have to jump through a bunch of hoops and spend triple or more what i did originally just to get an entry level setup that won't break down in under a month do not buy this record player i got it for christmas and was so excited to be able to play the large stack of old records and a few new ones that i had bought i put one on the turn table and started it playing and it skipped looked warped and sounded too slow and out of tune i tried it again with several records and got the same results over and over i tried the same records on an old record player and they played just fine i picked this junk up at urban outfitters and ever since then have had nothing but trouble i wanted to get back into vinyl collecting but if you really want to enjoy the records this product is not for you the speakers are tiny and extremely tinny and they take away from the warm sound of a record it also skips randomly it's completely unacceptable also you have to buy a separate adapter to play 's which also makes next to no sense to me instead i purchased the jensen jta if you plug in external speakers it's a wonderful player and it's so much cheaper don't mess with this turntable this was the first turntable i bought and let me tell you very not happy with this product when it arrived i did as the instructions and tested it out it worked perfectly the turntable turned i didn't have a record to play yet so i turned the player off i finally bought a record and came home to listen to it and when i tried to turn it on it wouldn't work the player will not turn on the turntable will not spin i started turning the turntable with my hand and only then would the on switch flicker i do not recommend this product i bought a new turntable the audio technica at lp and it works great do not buy the crosley the turntable was fine but the adapter cord that was provided did not work and we had to scramble around to find one somewhere that would get it to work on xmas day for our daughter better quality control would have been nice especially for a holiday present that gets wrapped upon receipt and you need to count on it to work when it is opened cannot recommend at all the few vinyls that we have played on it all skip unfortunately i ordered it in late october for a christmas present and now it can't be returned the record player came with a rip on the top which was embarrassing when the gift recipient opened it up but not nearly as embarrassing as when she tried to play the record by lorde that i purchased from amazon as well the record couldn't play for all the scratches and skips in it be very careful when considering to buy this record player crosley's have been known to ruin records but only after many hours of playing if you have a valuable record collection or expensive records you want to listen to i would not recommend this if you have cheap records i would be fine recommending it but do know you're records will stop working after a while other than that its sounds great and the color we got retro blue looks sick perfect gift for that wannabe hipster in the family but get grandpa the expensive audiotech player for his expansive collection awful sound quality records sound terrible when played on it and the box arrived scuffed and torn i would not recommend this product to anyone i have been wanting a record player for quite a long time and i had no clue this was what my sister was going to gift me this christmas i was beyond excited when i opened her package and saw this excitation in vain though once i plugged it in and began playing the beethoven records she included believe the other reviewers when they speak negatively of the speakers on this thing they are so low quality and horrendous that they won't handle the musical crescendos of the concerto as soon as the audio jumps the speakers pop and fizz instantly ruining the enjoyability of the music and tarnishing the quality really the only way i can bear listening to the classics on this thing is to keep the volume on the bare minimum so the speakers won't hiss at the crescendos you don't even have to be an audiophile for this to bother you if you're not deaf and don't want your music impeded by popping speakers i suggest looking elsewhere i would have asked to return this but i didn't want to be rude since it was a gift from the heart i'll probably get rid of it down the road and end up buying a high end set absolute junk arm is not even close to being weighted properly skates across the beginning of records had to weigh it down with a few quarters to fix that and shortly after the speed is so inconsistent the records are basically unplayable on it a replacement did the exact same thing just a cool looking record player that just barely does it's job they are hit or miss gave one to my girlfriend and it would skip no matter what i tried returned there is no way to adjust anything so when there is a problem you either have to just deal with it or hope you can return or exchange it the stylus weight is too light and constantly skipped all over the album for this thing needs a weight adjustment i will have to figure out a way to make adjustments maybe rubber bands i should have looked for another brand i haven't had much luck with crosley products great product works as expected love the look design color but the turntable wobbles making records wobble which makes them skip constantly plan to send it back for a refund read customer reviews on this model should have read them prior to ordering and saw that this is a common complaint from other people who have ordered this model constantly skips i couldn't get through a single song without obvious jumps will definitely be returning unfortunately made my daughter cry on the second night with it one speaker is making a ticking sound she went out and bought her first record for bucks with her savings and all it does is skip when i received the product it looks great however there are a few things that happened that really bothered me with this product cosmetically and functionally the construction isn't awful the hinges are not very strong and i wouldn't trust them to hold the lid up while a record is playing for very long unless the top of the case is supported by a wall or other item the real problem came when i tried to plug in the player and it wouldn't work it comes with a v dc cord mine was broken and unless you have a secondary cord that will work its not going to play honestly i was skeptical with the purchase and i went with it anyways but i got lucky having a second cord i had to exchange product since it did not rotate properly also i would have liked the cover to stand up straight when open instead of leaning back the color and size are great waiting on the replacement to arrive to try it out i piece of junk please do not waste your money if you are actually into music and collecting vinyl go buy a real record player with good sound quality if you just want this record player to play the and arctic monkeys on to go with your choker collection this is the one for you i purchased this turntable for my wife for christmas and it doesn't work good at all even if it's a low end low budget player the product should work that means no skipping no platter wobble etc it should play the vinyl records problem is it doesn't issues the needle arm has no weight to it so the needle will skip records very easily and it does it on all records the platter isn't large enough for vinyl records larger than s the platter wobbles constantly also increasing the chance for skipping the little rubber buttons on the platter were not even they're suppose to provide grip for the slipmat the slipmat is made of rubber and it was warped so the record couldn't lay flat do not ever play a record without a slipmat it can be damaged i am returning mine for full refund stay away horrible sounding and in my case the arm would only travel half way but even if it functioned flawlessly the sound is soooo bad that there is no reason to keep i know is very inexpensive but it's also cheap there's zero value to it wish i could give it no star i bought this for my daughter for christmas it looked great but skipped a lot i am in the process of returning it one star means i hate it looked everywhere for months to find a damn record player my kid could keep in her small dorm room to play vinyl there is nothing but this crap figured we'd make the best of it needle slides across most records but plays a few especially with a weight added to the arm ok we'll play those records nope day after christmas will not turn on this has a on off volume switch it clicks when you turn it all the way counter clockwise and goes to the off position not any more just spins we would gladly pay much more for something that just plays vinyl and is small but there is nothing on the market but this trash so completely and utterly disgraced by the turntable i received you can plain as day look right at it and see that it is not level thus making the record sound absolutely terrible when playing i was so excited to receive this and play my records on it and i am so irritated with the result crosley is supposed to be a good name as the one my father owns has been in great condition for as long as he owned it which is well over ten years i however will be returning mine first thing tomorrow morning first let me say this is the first bad review i have ever given amazon but this is the worst player i ever saw i got it as a christmas gift for my granddaughter she is in college so it wasn't for a child we all bought her records she says she will have to hang on the wall because this crowley player will never play them she opened it in my house just as it came it skipped across the records and never play any we checked all the reviews did out the suggestions and without in success please don't sell this to anyone else only good if you are a hipster and know nothing of audio if you like fake vintage looking things then its for you just to let you know there is a reason most turntables don't have speakers in it one those speakers sound bad and most importantly speakers cause vibrations and vibrations shift the records stylus causing noise and damaging your records not to mention the cheap tonearm and stylus do that on their own anyway a good way to ruin your vinyl collection you wont be able to hear the damage on the records on this player due to the cheap speakers but you will if you put your vinyl on something with a hint of quality terrible piece of junk we decided after less than minutes to return it multiple new records couldn't be played for more than seconds without skipping and it's very cheap looking and feeling in person they're trying to appeal to the retro loving movement that's oh so popular now and they do so in look only i guess if you're buying this to be a display piece on a shelf in a bedroom or something it'd work for that but a pretty expensive knick knack i'd say like a distant family member that came into my home took a dump in my toilet then left without flushing this record player disrespected me in my own house i boxed it up and told everyone not to even look at it before ups comes to pick this vagrant piece of junk up the speakers are so crappy that i couldn't hear it over my own breath yes i'm a mouth breather but c'mon i couldn't even hear it the tone arm is not adjustable so if your helen reddy vinyl has a slight warp there will be no angie baby tonight save your money and toss it at a fast moving train because that will be more satisfying than even plugging this into the outlet do not buy this thing yes its cute but it is not good for vinyl it will damage your records skip and sounds terrible get the audio technica lp save the trouble bad noise screech everything else is ok to me having issues with the player skipping after months of moderate use i want to say i love my crosley and it is totally meeting my expectations as far as sound however the turntable was terribly busted on the casing one of the latches was broken and there were a few dings and scratched exterior the box was in excellent condition so i don't think it happened in route i decided not to complain because i didn't feel like dealing customer service but when asked about giving a review i thought interested parties should know about the cosmetic defects returned it a total waste of time and money skips and scratches for a beginner just hopping into the world of vinyl this is a decent starter do not expect audiophile quality out of this player however the rca outputs on the player provides a fair quality signal do not expect the built in speakers to sound good at all the built in speakers sound pretty terrible however when hooked up to external speakers or a sound system it sounds much better the headphone jack on mine did not produce listenable quality signal the arm on this turn table is not weighted so keep that in mind the biggest irritation on this player is the fact that when the audio signal is outputted to speakers and the volume is completely turned down on the device you still hear some sound from the on board speakers not a huge problem considering the sound will be covered up from the speakers the signal is being outputted to but an annoyance non the less all in all if you are just jumping into the world of vinyl this is a decent choice assuming you have speakers to play this through the needle was crap slid up and down the record took it back got another on the replacement model the belt wouldn't even spin these things are a joke stay far away from them as other reviewers have noted this thing skips like crazy and has an overall screechy sound to it would never recommend this product to even my worst enemy this was nothing like i expected i like it but want i really wanted to love it after a few times using it i bought a brand new lp and when i played it it kept skipping at first i thought it was dust or unseen scratches but i cleaned it cleaned the needle dusted all around and still it skipped when i played the same record on my old player which only cost me compared to the i payed for this one it played smoothly i had to replace the needle on my essentially brand new crosley after only having it a month or so and only using it three or four times thats not worth it to me the speakers suck but i'm pretty sure i can buy some better ones and hook them up to it it's pretty cool for a portable set up though awesome coloring too a little cheaper then i expected the parts are flimsy and easily breakable i don't regret buying it but i don't love it it's a solid okay when shopping for this product i read many positive reviews and expected to receive a decent quality beginner turntable and thus it was at my house within a few days and i immediately put a record on i was immediately disappointed with the sound quality that it would put out the built in speakers are embarrassingly terrible and have far too much midrange which makes the unit rattle i connected it through rca cables to my home stereo with hopes it would improve yet it still maintains a very thin sound ideally the purpose of purchasing and collecting vinyl is to experience the sound quality this player also skips quite a bit on every track on multiple records it's a nice clean design which is great but that's about as far as it goes i would not recommend this product to anyone warped sound very poor quality but return was smooth and customer service was great too bad the product wasn't as great as the service i purchased this record player from urban outfitters about a week ago and just today have purchased a brand new record to play on it upon playing i realized the turntable was extremely wobbly and was able to physically watch the record bob up and down resulting in a sound equivalent to nails on a chalkboard upon reading the reviews for this product and many others made by crosley i have confirmed that crosley is a terrible cheap brand and the only thing it has going for it is its aesthetics would highly recommend purchasing a different product if you want better sound and something that will not damage your records the needle puts way too much weight on your records and is absolute crap as well will destroy them within no time overall a very cheaply made product not suitable for playing records have returned mine and am currently waiting for a new one of a different brand to arrive first time reviewer here my girlfriend bought this player for my birthday and we had to return it twice i will not be requesting a third delivery the first record player worked fine but the case cover was scratched and had a few dings note that we purchased it 'new' we chalked those issues up to potential delivery problems but when the second player arrived i realized that this is just a shoddily manufactured product the 'crosley' text on the interior of the case was laughably crooked although i agree that sound performance should be the number one attribute of any record player the fact of the matter is that a main allure of this hardware is its cosmetic charm i'm going to save and spring for a product that i know has been manufactured with care unfortunately as cool as this looks and it looks awesome outside design is gorgeous it can't even play a brand new record waste of time as had to return it plays okay speakers are crap but if you use external speakers it's awesome piece of garbage do not waste your time or money i wish i could attach an audio file of the mess that spews out of this pos it doesn't spin at a consistent speed so the music is totally distorted and out of tune sounding the turntable doesn't even spin flat it's all wobbly i've had this for about minutes and couldn't be more disgusted that somebody actually recommends playing precious vinyls on this really cool looking but first the jack for the ac adapter is the back and the chord itself is crushed if you open the unit the whole way then the plastic plate that secures the ac jack simply broke so i glued that it sort of works now but really just shockingly poor design considering how awesome this record player looks no stop don't don't do it really don't do it junk left right front to back and everywhere in between go get an audio technica for buy a little amp and speakers for another and never look back crap a crosley no received this turntable for my birthday since i love records and love listening to vinyls and it's horrible it's very tiny which isn't a huge deal but the speakers are also very tiny and don't provide a whole lot of sound even at maximum volume it was barely noticeable the quality of the sound is very poor it's almost wobbly like and it sounds as if the musicians are singing underwater or something plus i couldn't even listen to a song all the way through it skips a lot my advice don't buy this if you want a record player a good one at least splurge on a more expensive one trust me this crosley one sucks and i'm already returning it i bought what appeared to be a solid turntable months ago i was wrong this stanky piece of dook is nothing but a stanky piece of dook after months the motor went out and the records started playing at near half speed the stank is unbearable from this dook record player it will stank up yo apaatmrnt i give it one long coiled piece of dook junk first i love that people are getting back into vinyl if you think this is what vinyl should sound like you're wrong my clock radio has better speakers i got this to fit in with my decor and hopefully to replace my current stereo nothing wrong with it it sounds fantastic but i bought it at a garage sale for years ago and it's big it's an off brand and wasn't high quality when it was made in the 's but records sound x better on that beast than they do on this little junky player i have a portable fisher price kids record player from the 's that sounds and works better not only is the sound bad the laminate on the deck is chipped and coming up right out of the box the vinyl is torn in two places and extremely fragile crosley you get points for making record players that look cool but i could get a much better retro one for the same price this one is an exchange as the first one i got didn't work at all a complete waste of money crosley has made the baby toy maker 'preschool' appear hi tech with this pitiful cheaply made plastic player please save your money up for a real turntable not a redeeming quality about it shipping is completely ridiculous cost me extra dollars because there was not enough postage plays great though don't think i will order anything from these people ever again though we bought this for our year old daughter who loves indie music and anything retro everything about it is quite charming except that after about a week it started slowing down and the records were sounding strange she had no idea because the whole record player experience is new to her but we knew that tell tale slow down noise my husband was able to return it and we received a new one promptly the second one seems to be fine and it's been about a month bought this record player at target along with the arctic monkeys am upon playing it for the second time it began to skip i was devastated and blamed the vinyl i then ordered a gesaffelstein limited edition lp and upon playing it for the first time it began to skip curious i took both vinyls to a friends numark ttusb turntable and it played perfectly luckily target gives you days to return an item and when i went to check out their other selections i saw returned open boxes of this same product on the shelves picked up the same numark ttusb turntable and all my vinyls play without a hitch would absolutely not recommend oh and the built in speakers not trying to be funny but my iphone s has better sound quality than these fun for three months till it broke sounds good but just not a quality product i read a few reviews saying the same thing before i bought it now i'm regretting the decision this thing is super cute but it sucks it slows down the audio so it almost sounds like one of those toys for kids that slow down or speed up your speech i've read other reviews about this and it is all completely true completely noticeable and irritating the needle seems pretty cheap if a record isnt perfect it skips where as my other record player it plays it just fine i like the design a lot more than the quality of this this thing is pretty much useless for anything except maybe in a kid's room with old mickey mouse records it's very cute and i like the overall design idea but the sound is terrible you can't replace the cartridge and it feels like it's doing damage to the vinyl i tried to return mine but the seller just said to keep it and gave me the money back so i've got to give it at least two stars everything about this was good and as expected except for the sound quality i didn't expect to much in terms of sound with it being a portable record player but it was still a little weaker then i thought it would be it would be perfect for a small office because you can't turn it up past a mid quiet before sound quality quickly starts degrading it will be nice background noise and an attractive center piece when company is over we have another record player with amplification and large vintage speakers the sound quality between the is worlds apart bottom line if you're looking for good record player sound go another route with bigger speakers and some sort of amplification behind it if you're looking for something more decorative stylish and not so worried about sound quality this is a good option at a good price i love everything about it except the fact the volume doesn't go up very high its a very nice turntable other then that at first i thought it was a good price for a cool retro looking record player however its very poor quality and looks cheap the speaks are awful the vinyl hits the back lid often which is a design flaw save your money for a good record player you'll regret buying this i ordered this product for my child's th birthday when it arrived it did not function as no power was received by the player i had to send back i also had to pay to parcel force for delivery within the uk which was not indicated on the shipping order when placed this product broke within months it just doesn't power on anymore tech support still hasn't called me back after months of waiting do not buy for the price buy something else vintage it's falling apart after only a few uses the sound is wonky the records spin wonky don't buy this great portable little record player works perfectly only beef is that it has tinny sound an external speaker fixes that can anything sound so awful i'm new to the world of vinyl but on a budget and wanted something to play the few records i happen to have i did some research and knew this machine was frowned upon by audiophiles but not one site went into why these machines were so bad just that they were and with so many high reviews on amazon from the average consumer i thought hey this thing should at least tide me over until i can afford something decent right wrong right out of the box this cute little machine gave me problems even my untrained ear could tell that the speed was not constant that the noise was too much i sat through an entire record hoping to warm up the hell screech of the speakers switched over to my earbuds and immediately switched back even with my moderate level headphones the sound coming out of this thing was worse than my iphone's speaker from this newb's perspective let me share with you what is wrong with this machine the music sounds uneven there is something wrong with the sound some of it comes out of the onboard speakers and what escapes through there is lost to any external sound system you can hook up to it if your external sound systems even work out of it half of mine will plug in fine but no sound comes out it just doesn't sound good i wish i could offer you a suggestion for a different unit but this is my first it's almost enough to turn me off of vinyl completely except i know there is better sound out there and i already have a 'table picked out for later star because it's cute and smaller than i thought it'd be more star because it seems to work right out of the box but that's all you're getting from me crosley poor quality the turntable began to warp and rotate off balance after just one month of use sound quality is awful would not even buy this at a goodwill if it had a tag on it horrible sound quality also the adapter hole it larger than the turntable spindle and the records play and sound wobbly its a nice size nice looking but sounds so tinny like a 's transistor radio the items itself is a pretty great quality record player the speakers could be louder and the headphone jack doesn't seem to work when it arrived at my house it was put on my doorstep with the picture of the item on the box for anyone to see after receiving our replacement the record player still did not work the second on was worst than the first we will be returning this item and choosing a different product the turntable was uneven in both models causing the music to skip and in the replacement one the speed was horrible uncalibrated to the music got this as a christmas present most likely purchased from urban outfitters anyway its a cool concept and when it works is pretty neat but i've just barely had this for months and the motor is already hesitant to start i have a small selection of vinyls so its not like i'm listening to this thing everyday even every week i have to turn the power on and then spin the album to the correct speed using my fingers and then eventually the turntable works on its own and its fine stars is don't like it but when it works i very much do record players have only been around for n years you'd think turntable technology especially portable turntables would be more robust after reading several reviews i decided to give it a try i followed all the tricks and suggestions others made including oiling the turning mechanism this thing just doesn't play smooth if you want to have distorted sounding music coming out of tinny speakers then this is the deal for you otherwise save your money for a better machine oh and i would have ignored this last bit if it played nicely but it even has a chemically plastic smell to it junk pure junk through and through a friend had a similar crosley player that has worked well for the past three years so i made the jump and bought this one the turntable stopped playing within three days it can not be used as a portable turntable it needs to be connecting to electricity the whole time total crap it arrived broken it's almost all plastic the case was not inlaid correctly crap tastic way to sell record players to hipsters wow this thing if you own newer gram vinyl do not use this turntable it will ruin them after one spin the ceramic needle is a record ruiner no other way to describe it do not waste a dime on this piece of crap i'm really bummed i purchased this record player last month from urban outfitters and i wasn't expecting anything amazing but it's just not functional even on the correct speed the music sounds warped i'm going to have to purchase a different turntable unfortunately i tossed the box immediately so a return is not an option the speakers are ok but it doesn't really help because i can't play my music it's cute it's fairly portable and it hasn't broken on me yet despite it's fairly reasonable price which usually means this product is poorly made the sound quality however is completely lame thank goodness there's an auxiliary jack in the back so i can plug in a set of decent speakers for the buck it is a bargain but sound quality is really poor speakers crackle and have no life i should have invested a bit more money records are not to be played with any expectation of sound on this unit i lost my adapter and called the manufacturer asked for help in getting a new one i'm still waiting no email no pnone message on my answering machine but from someone else i got it for to hold me over to save up for a real system basic problem is the bigger records the turn table is to small there is no support for the outer edges of the record so when the need is on the first few songs it skips a lot once you get to song and the record has more support from the table it works okay if you are paying more than you are wasting your time if you are buying this for a teenager who merely likes the color novelty and idea then this is fine if you want bigger sound you will need to hook it up to some speakers pros are compact size and portability novelty colors cons sound this thing kinda sucks it works most of the time however after using it for more than minutes the speed sometimes will slow and you feel like you're listening to your vinyl in slow motion really annoying the lid also doesn't fully remove disappointing buy the turn table seemed to run a little slow so the sound was a little distorted at times but you could only tell if you were really listening and paying attention to the quality its good if you just have some records you want to listen too but not good for sound output initially i was very pleased with this record player however after about a week the turntable got very warped and my records all sounded terrible no matter what i played the speakers aren't awesome quality but you get what you pay for i guess if you're interested in all at good sound quality or longevity don't buy this record player i read all the bad reviews about this product but decided to disregard them in hopes that some of the positive reviews would prove true it was a bad mistake the record player could not play any records without skipping i tried playing different records and all of them skipped i would highly recommend that if you are in the market for an intro record player spend a few extra bucks and go with a different company crosley has definitely nailed the vintage aesthetic but as far as function this record player is garbage had to return it to amazon purchased at target and returning immediately records skip and speed slows down sound is pathetic it's clear that they just do not make things like they used to bought the turquoise cute compact the speakers have a very retro rattley or track or garage sound however the speed was waaaaay off because the lps drag against the lid if the lid is not fully extended backward in other words you can not use it with the lid open at a angle straight up as shown in photo without the lp scraping on the lid poor design at first thought the motor was bad then we realized you have to pull the unit almost its full depth away from the wall and pull the lid open almost degrees so the doesn't drag along the lid update i called crosley and the very poorly spoken woman told me the lid was removable which it is not as confirmed today by crosley tech support i almost dameged the lid trying to remove it one technician said he would send a second rubber mat to elevate the lp but his supervisor said he would worry that this would damage the motor extremely unqualified unhelpful and belligerent customer service my parents have a ton of records and i am not in the position to spend a lot of money on a quality turntable speakers so i thought this was the next best thing boy was i wrong my ihome sounds better than this piece of crap i opened the box started playing sticky fingers and proceeded to repackage it immediately i do not recommend that anyone buy this record player if they don't want a musical experience that severely taints awesome albums i will wait unit i have enough money to play albums as they are intended to be heard honestly this thing has been such a headache i wish i spent the money on a good one like this is cute and all but after you play a few records on it it stops working please don't waste your money do not buy this record player it played all my records one night fine though with the expected lackluster sound quality after buying a few new records i came home to have a listen and all the old ones now sound warped i am honestly afraid that this record player not only sounds terrible but has ruined my records not bad for a player in this price range grease keeps leaking up from under the turntable and how has gotten on the belt drive causing it to slip with heavier records not the best by far but does the trick the lid sometimes hits the record which messes up the playback buy with both eyes open if you are looking for a legitimate record player this is not for you if you are looking for completely self contained portable record player this is all there is crosley appears to own this nitch and they all appear to have the same guts just different styles i will only add that this specific model has a serious design flaw where the lid tends to rub against the album if not fully opened some of their other styles do not have this problem so if you expectations are low you should be happy i had high hopes for this turntable but it played records too fast straight out of the box after fiddling around with it i noticed that it would only play at a normal speed about one out of ten times it would also play records are variable speeds e g for one minute it would play at a normal speed and then it would suddenly speed up terrible i'll admit i wasn't expecting surround sound with this compact record player but come on it sounds like a fisher price close and play very bad quality only thing positive i can say about this product is that it's a neat looking little record player you would see from the 's or 's era i was so excited to get this and the light turned on and then just fades out i talked to a pro audio repair guy he said its no use trying to fix it i also talked to other people who got one that didint work its such a hassle trying to return it ive sent over emails and am still confused how to do it dont risk it dont buy it returned it it is cute and retro but it plays terribly after sending it back i went and purchased the crosley traveler which plays great this turntable is garbage don't let these positive reviews deceive you i was deceived by these positive reviews and said oh well there's enough positive reviews to make this a good item to buy oh was i wrong only give it stars folks that's not good i wouldn't recommend wasting the time on this crap it distorts the sound and runs slow it is made in china and sucks get a reliable turntable if you want to listen to some good vinyls with that said jesus is lord i love the way it looks matches with my other pale aqua stuff collection i down graded to this from a pro ject debut iii since i couldn't be bothered to get a proper amp and speakers i figured a cheaper portable record player would suit me much better plus i like a more vintage look though i did find it a bit heavy but i'm very weak so that's not saying much haha as for the sound i don't know how to describe it it's like a warped out of tune sound it only happens sometimes like when there is twangy instruments playing like when i'm listening to john lennon and george harrison and yes i used the rubber pad thingy if there is a way to fix this i would love to know how the volume on this sytem is inadequate what's that you say no not a thing is wrong with my hearing i am thinking about returning because the speakers are emitting a ghost kind of sound from them when playing records at first i thought it may be the record but it keeps doing it the lps touches on the lid sounds like a silly detail but it is not i'm very disappointed because of it bought this from urban outfitters expecting something half decent for the price point but definitely came away disappointed the sound quality from both speakers and headphones is very very poor with so much of the sound completely missing this isn't my first record player so it's not that i'm not used to how the format should sound tinny childish speakers don't give much of anything in the form of quality sound it was only a few steps above a singing greeting card also you could continually hear the song changing speeds pitch due to the cheap belt drive it was small changes but noticing it really takes you out of the song and makes you focus on how poorly built and executed the record player is the design and appearance is great i just wish that the hardware actually delivered returning it today i put this item on our wedding registry hoping that we would be able to play some old records upon opening it and setting it up we were disappointed it made every record we played on it sound crazy lots of distorted sound almost like it couldn't get the speed quite right after trying about different albums to no avail we decided to we had to send the thing back bought for our daughter who was moving on from a 's era rca that we bought her for her th birthday still looks very cool too let me preface this by saying the vendor we bought this from ivgstores has been great so far nothing against them the player however is garbage in my opinion the table is very light the motor makes a very audible humming sound as it turns the table the lid on the case has the potential to interfere with the album the worst part however is the sound quality now our unit had a broken right speaker out of the box so it's possible the left speaker was also damaged but the sound was quite abysmal if you have an iphone handy play a song through the phone speaker that is better than what i was hearing out of this thing i have to give it two thumbs down the only redeeming quality is the case itself which seems to be of reasonable quality it's going back now and i just ordered the audio technica at lp for a few dollars more and am going to use some external speakers technica at lp automatic driven turntable let me start with the good this record player looks nice it looks great in a small space especially one with a retro vibe from a distance it even looks like a quality product up close it does look a little cheaper plastic etc so if you want this just for looks have at it but if you want to play vinyl here's the bad others have mentioned that the speakers sound small or bad but i thought they actually sound fine however it becomes irrelevant because the sound produced is always at an inaccurate pace all records i played were either too fast or too slow at first they were always too slow then i noticed that lp's records were so big and the player so small that they were dragging on the opened lid this is nothing more than an absolute design flaw and should have never been released for sale however i took the lid completely off and then found that records played at variable speeds i was using the provided rubber slip mat but it made no difference here is the problem this player is belt driven belt drive is simply a bad design and i will never purchase another player that is belt driven i'm sure there are some good players out there for much more money that are in fact belt driven and work fine but eventually it will lead to this same problem the solution buy a direct drive turntable it's the only way to avoid this i returned this and purchased an audio technica at lp here at amazon and it's been the happiest purchase i've made in a decade it's very pricey compared to this i paid so if you're not serious about lp's vinyl i wouldn't recommend it but if you are and you want the best it's an amazing value actually seeing a real turntable reminded me that this is complicated business it requires things like counterweights adjustable depending on the stylus anti skate control and tone arm assembly height adjustments this crosley doesn't take any of that into consideration i don't write many reviews but this product was so poorly made i felt i had to likewise the audio technica is so well made i will write a review for it too i only paid for this product the red one during a holiday sale but would have been too much because it simply does not work and that my friends is one major problem good luck it looks great it's good enough to play my records and it has an stylish design however i found that the left speaker is not functioning the sound only comes from the right one i would give it stars if it wasn't for that defect this turntable is cute and very easily portable but the bass deep notes don't sound very good i'd recommend getting a larger one i bought it as a gift and it broke within a week won't play any record speed also the built in speakers are really bad quality i would recommended that no one buys this product i heard great reviews about crosley but this did not live up to any although the turntable should have been great we bought the floral one instead the one that arrived was damaged it had a tear on the blue covering at one of the corners the box was very beat up upon arrival i'm so cheap so thats why i bought it but works okay since i just want to hear some records unimpressed this is my second crosley turntable and i can say that their quality is non existent sound is tiny the volume is very low even cranked all the way up and overall sounds as if you are listening to your records through a can this is not for audiophiles but okay for a vinyl amateur it looks nice as decor but that is as far as it goes my records played as if i was playing them through am radio or much worse really not worth it i can only suggest a technics but that may be far from many people's budget pass on this update not having found the turntable whose sound i'm happy with including this item being reviewed as well as a function emerson vintage sound system and the cheapest one by audio technica i had to take the plunge and get me a technics mk it's a beauty and the sound is unparalleled soft warm and true to the speed a record was meant to be heard the others are introductory and will only make you wish you could upgrade to the gem a technics turntable is today i received this record player for the second time the first one i got the speed tracking was way off when i got the second one today i had the same issue it seems nuts that this is the second malfunctioning record player that has been sent to me love the style but now i'm in search for a new record player once again i didn't want to spend that much on a record player and this seemed like a good product to get however after listening to a few vinyls on it it gave everything a wobble and seemed to slow everything down you get what you pay for this record player looks great but does not work after about a week it stopped playing the records at a consistent speed making everything sound warped i got it replaced hoping it was just a fluke but the same thing happened with the second one i would not recommend this product i can not express the frustration i've experienced with this adorable piece of junk i really wanted a light blue record player so i bought this even though it was backordered for three months when i finally got it it turned on but it would not spin so i sent it back and got an identical replacement that one was damaged in the box and the turntable was crooked or bent so i sent it back for a replacement i know i know i should have just gotten a refund i just received my second replacement in the mail and this one is shockingly also damaged it spins but records turn at a weird angle which makes them sound distorted and terrible i'd be afraid to damage my records you can literally see them playing unevenly so now i'm getting my money back avoid this adorable nightmare at all costs when i first received this item it was defective it would play 's too slow then speed up then slow down after contacting the seller they told me to contact the manufacturer i contacted the manufacturer and was told the item was defective and needed to be sent back to brookstone's credit they sent me a new one fairly quickly however the new one was playing 's out of the box too slow i contacted the manufacturer and they informed me i would have to adjust the motor by opening up the unit and use a small flat head screw driver to adjust the speed of the motor why on earth would you ship a product that doesn't work out of the box and requires literally opening it up and fiddling with the motor on the customer end after jumping through these hoops and adjusting the motor it's almost impossible to manually get it at the right speed after much tweaking save yourself some trouble and purchase something different not as great as i was expecting it to be followed the directions and tried a few different vinyls because in the beginning the sound was awful i finally realized i had to add another part to it to sound better but even when i did the sound didn't sound as exact as the singers do i wish the speakers were louder and the sound wasn't terrible ugh this record player is really beautiful in design and color sadly the sound quality was horrible i don't understand how this player doesn't have a knob to adjust the tone the speakers are so small the sound was cheesy like it was playing from a child's toy or radio sad we also have the crosley cr in blue and wanted this one to save space since the cr is a bit bigger well it sadly disappointed especially compared to our cr which sounds amazing lightweight easily portable decent sound there are ways to improve upon this item add a built in compartment to hold the separate power cord add a way to hold the slipmat in place while in transport beef up the speakers the current sound is good but there is plenty of room for improvement this is worth the money i paid i would recommend this and buy this product again update lowered rating to stars after about hours of use over several months the left speaker blew out during a bto rock session even without the speakers at full volume i'll probably end up purchasing a new turntable as the sound quality is now unlistenable money not well spent don't buy this product the needle is impossible to remove without pliers and then even more impossible to replace the sound is not great and the speakers are awful color is off it's a much more dull shade of blue then the lighter blue portrayed in the picture also the turntable played records as if they were warped the records would wobble around when played on the turntable speakers are also low quality broke just decent pros very resilient sound great for their size easy to operate cons i bought of them one had a defective battery the other eventually broke the usb socket because the design has insufficient clearance to most usb plugs i think this is why they stop charging and won't turn on after a year or so you'll enjoy it while it lasts but don't expect it to last forever if not for the design defect in the charging port this would be an excellent product does not come with the usb charging cable that should have been inside the box this is ridiculous i definitely will not be buying any more jbl products it worked great for the first day after a couple hours of use it started making a really creepy distorted sound in the music and it won't connect to my phone at all i have even tried to connect it to my friend's phones and that didn't work either and yes i followed the instructions step by step also it has had no exposure to water heat cold or any other damaging conditions this is broken within months of use x week i only used it for a month for it won't turn on any longer i really liked the speaker too bad it only lasted months it won't stay powered it won't charge jbl's website won't let me enter any product information on its warranty page the clip broke very easily soon after i got this everything was perfect until i opened the box and noticed that the usb for charging was missing i bought of these one of them the box is damaged and seemed like it s been opened i m disappointed because these are supposed to be gifts for friends it has been less than a year and the battery doesn't hold more than an hour when it's fully charged i wish it was a little louder stopped working after a week not sure i would buy another i loved this speaker up until the caribiner clip fell off days after i bought it in the middle of my beach day on vacation very disappointed thumbs down jbl after days it stopped being able to charge and the year warranty with jbl is total crap their warranty forms on their website is disabled and it s impossible to speak to a customer service rep its best to seek out options with aleast a day return policy to make sure your device isnt a dud it doesn t work don t by not the sound quality jbl has had in the past a little disappointed sound quality is not as good as models a few years ago sadly i missed my return window purchased this for our trip to hawai'i last month but since it didn't work we left it at home when we got home it slipped our minds until it was too late it pairs and plays fine for one song but then when a new song comes on no sound through the speaker the music is still playing on a phone we tried both droids if we stopped the music on the phone and hit play again sound for that song same rigamarole when the next song comes on what a waste of my i have it to my son's friend he's going to try it on his iphone cannot get it to charge at all bought to take on a trip and it didn't work at all not worth it at all poor volume and zero base i'm returning for a refund asap i bought it to use it at my job it doesn't work anymore it won't play anymore and it hasn't even been months since i bought it sound quality is just a step above my phones sound not good its ok not loud at all just slightly more than the phone speaker item came in a used box already torn open product has been used i ordered a new speaker also the charge port is damaged straight out of the box i had this speaker for a month before it fell apart i had it hanging from the clip in my car and one day it just cracked in the middle and now is only held together by a small wire i had to ductape it and the sound quality is really bad not worth the price at all it got stolen two days later guess it's too easy to steal i had previously owned one of these speakers and i absolutely loved it so when mine got lost in a trip i decided to buy another one i used the new speaker i order twice the first time i used it i let it die before recharging it for the first time and everything was normal after a second use i was beginning to get complimens from my friend for being loud for it's size i stopped using it for a week and on the third use the speaker stopped playing so i thought it needed to be charged but to my surprise it never turned back on maybe it was just this speaker i never had a problem with the previous one i had bought before it is defective the clip will not charge the clip broke within a week but since it was a gift it wasn't opened until after i could return it sound quality was decent still usable but kind of defeats the purpose without the clip great sound for the price i wish for better battery life and a better audio cable product stopped working less than a month after receiving it i attempted to return it but seller would not work with us it was a waste of money and i will not buy from this seller again i was told by others this was a good purchase but i don't think so after of only one week of usage it stopped working not sure if i will waste bucks again i loved this product but i'm very sad because the charge's door not close completely and because of this i can't put it into or near the water terrible clip design it broke after using a few times over the summer would not buy again do not buy this piece of crap i have had two clip s and they both did exactly the same thing they shut off spontaneously for no reason i carry it on my tool belt and i thought maybe as it swings around it hits the on off button i covered the button with swveral layers of electrical tape and still same thing units are fully charged so thats not the issue two seperate units doing exactly the same thing doubt it will never buy a jbl product again the cord that plugs in your cell phone is poorly attached to the speaker and no longer worked after months of use it sat on my desk plugged in on a daily basis so the use was gentle i was upset to hear that this speaker did not work at all from the person it was gifted to wouldnt even turn on or charge at all the sound quality is ok but the battery life is horrible it barely gives me min per charge i loved it for seven months then it died today i'm checking if i have any recourse same issue as many others blue and red blinking light of death super bummed stay away i got this to connect to my jbl flip it is not capable of doing that pretty ridiculous it is not capable of being found by the jbl connect app either was cracked when i got it and wouldn't come on that's unexpected so yeah wire is cut won t take charge will be returning this was a great speaker for the price bought it for my son for christmas to use on the slopes while snowboarding it is now a lost speaker on a hill somewhere since the clip did not hold he is is devastated if the manufacturer could have put a clip on it for what it was intended for i wouldn't be writing this review very disappointed if you need a speaker for your iphone this can work if you have a ipad don't bother ipad's built in speakers are way than this jbl does have what sounds like bass but sound is very muddy and not clear at all basically way overpriced after months of normal use the wire stopped working and now i have no choice but to use it in bluetooth mode i chose this design specifically because i prefer not to use bluetooth and expose myself to unnecesary wireless signals i think that after months the device should still work like new and am very disappointed in the quality prior to this i was very happy with the speaker couldn't make it work nice and loud this small speaker packs a punch perfect for taking along for a bike ride hours of music no more than that though waisted my iphone is louder than the speaker i purchased gave this to my grandson for christmas it wont sync with anything will not stay on obviously this particular unit is faulty because i also purchased one for my granddaughter and hers was perfect amazon will not let me return it or replace it very disappointed i will not let my grandson be disappointed so i will go to a store where they would exchange if something was faulty and purchase another one i've been a amazon customer for over years and never had a problem until now sound quality isn't great barely any bass to speak of which leaves the music feeling a bit empty that is my only complaint but i think it is sufficient to justify a the price size and bluetooth capabilities of this are nice but as a stand alone speaker its not great i own two of these one i gave to my mom as standalone speaker thats the stars but my second one i have plugged directly into my stereo system so this effectively acts as a bluetooth receiver for any device i play my music through this which is plugged into the stereo so i get the full sound its good for that but you don't need the thing to just use it as a bluetooth receiver anyway its ok you won't return it but maybe look for another one in the range if you want better sound quality i found the usb is broken and i couldn t use it it s made me feeling bad good volume and sound for about months and then it starts to buzz and rattle when you play at any volume louder than a hum i wear it during my bike commute so it has to be pretty loud months is unacceptable to hear a buzz i procrastinated returning it in time and now i regret it i just got one of these as a gift from work while it works fine you can use to call through it sounds fine to me but the other person will hear themselves as they are talking to you that's fine as its main purpose isn't to be used as bluetooth for phone call what really bugs me is the minus volume button all the other buttons have a very audiable click and you can feel the button being depressed but the minus volume button doesn't have that click sound or feel also the other buttons are hand operational while the minus button i have to use hands to push it also i'm not a small guy i'm ft and go to the gym days a week i feel like i might have got a defective one where they actually forgot to but the button on the minus volume and that's why i have to push so hard if thats how its suppose to be its a bad design it hurts my fingers to lower the volume its like trying to load that last cartridge in brand new magazine if you know what i mean lol just gave these as holiday gifts neither one worked i ordered two blue and two black speakers the black ones work fine the blue do not it says i can't return or exchange so silly me for shopping early for christmas gifts stuck with two worthless speakers this speaker wasn't even as loud as my phone speaker what's the point of having a speaker if it's not even going to be louder than the cell phone speaker not loud enough what's the use of a speaker if it isn't louder than your phone volume i haven't tested the waterproof these are not new love this device battery life is good when on bluetooth you can stop start and skip songs using the answer phone button however i am disappointed this button does not work when the auxiliary cord is plugged into the iphone update this product broke after months of heavy use the cover for the speaker fell off while i was commuting and now the sound quality is terrible jbl is giving me an issue with the warranty because the seller on amazon is not an authorized jbl distributor it stop working after the battery is off and i cannot recharge it any more so disappointed i bought this back in aug but just opened it this speaker will not charge at all i let it on overnight and tried different chargers but nothing update i m removing stars because it won t pair with my amazon exho dot and it wouldn t pair with a friend s iphone on a recent camping trip aside from these issues it s great but being that for this speaker to even work it has to connect to devices get that fixed jbl you re either bluetooth or you re not i work in production sound staging and lighting so we know the jbl brand very well this little speaker really packs a punch so much so that we turned around and bought everyone at work one for their christmas stocking stuffer i ll be using mine in my small rv perfect size for camping and outdoor fun love this speaker and the convienence of being able to click it to anything dissapointed since i just bought this two weeks ago for and now it s don't recommend buying it had a little over a month the charging port broke couldn't get ahold of the right seller even with my oder number kept getting the run around looks great loved the clip and build and size but not the sound quality bought this as a gift for my daughter sound is good but not for all sounds i am no audiophile mid tones vocal are great say adele or jason mraz but not roy orbison bass is decent but the moment there is music and a variety of instruments it feels more like noise the whole quality goes down its not bad at all but instead of spending on this i would rather try a different brand that is lot cheaper and has decent reviews also those that are sold for are factory re certified i dont mind fact re certified but it should have been explicitly mentioned it was not obvious to me but the factory re certified is right on the box direct from jbl see pic but this can be used for as a price match at your local store your mileage may vary with light use of the speaker it can no longer hold a charge after months and even powers off at times while plugged in do not buy this product i have had this speaker for months now and within the past month or two it has not been holding a charge for not than a few hours it seems i'm not sure if it's a charging issue as i've tried multiple cords with the same result or the stated battery life of hours is just not accurate either way i wish i could return it and get a different one but amazon states it is past the return window very useful for broadcasting songs to attract birds the charging port broke within a month of delicate use opened this product and the bluetooth connection didn t work not even the light would turn on i returned the item the same day i got it waste of time this speaker is no longer working and no respond from the seller my speaker doesn t work anymore and i can t return it i purchased this for my year old son very excited to receive it was a big let down it wouldn't charge or even turn on we messed around with different chargers because the first ine and second one wouldn't even show that it was capturing a charge we were in the process of returning the product and our tallest dog a puppy goldendoodle got a hold of it and chewed it it bits puppies uh i would've definitely returned this product this bluetooth speaker only worked while being plugged onto the charger it s a great speaker but if you don t have the volume on really low it dies in about hours will not charge after only a couple uses i tried to find a fix online after no luck with jbl customer service the charging issue appears to be a common problem that has no good solution i do not recommend this product little bass crackly sound that i expected but didn't really like constant dropping of bluetooth connection to mac even when less than a foot away ridiculous only works as a plug in speaker for the laptop tho it seems to hold a connection better with the iphone not worth the and now i can't find the receipt so can't return to jbl it will not work without being plugged in the sound isnt very clear when connected it skips when the plug doesnt like its position will return couldn't get it to turn on when not connected to outlet thought this was awesome descent sound for being so little like the design died after first charge done with jbl all the speakers i've bought for family members lasted a few months the one i bought for myself lasted one charge unfortunately the carabiner broke just two months after i bought this speaker the sound quality is ideal for biking which is why i had bought it but the carabiner breaking has left a bad taste in my mouth hoping they would send me another carabiner but they don't appear to have replacements looked great until i tried to use it won't charge just a solid blue light when plugged in the orange light indicates that it is charging i was dismayed when i looked at customer feedback for this seller and found that a number of other people have had identical issues recently i'm returning it and keeping an eye on the status of the refund to make sure it goes through can't help but think i've been swindled and am feeling less and less satisfied with the ethics of amazon in general if i still have your attention i highly recommend that you watch for unidentified charges on your card from amazon if you can't track it through your orders call their customer support and ask for answers seems like something is loose in the speaker and the sound goes in and out disappointing because i ve only had it for about a month with very light use maybe i got a defective one i'm very disappointed the product i received is defective doesn't charge and doesn't work doesn't take charge has never worked unable to bluetooth sync to multiple phones limited instructions in box researched online for tips tricks to get it to take charge and sync but nothing has worked only way to get it to work is to keep it plugged into power source and have phone hooked up to it bluetooth has never been able to work going to send it back so disappointed it never held a charge meh purchased a jbl clip about a month ago from bonus deal in anticipation of some outdoors adventures i was planning to go on finally opened it up charged it multiple times and the thing won't even turn on i've had one of these before and when they work they're excellent but i can't give more than star for being sent a defective product please contact me i need to get a replacement asap and would rather not have to return it to amazon and wait a week the sound quality is okay the front mesh part of the speaker keeps coming off very disappointed in the product i bought mine in april it died august like many of the other reviews posted here it stopped charging and no longer will turn on would love to have it replaced was working great up until then and i liked the sound quality it's super disappointing it didn't even last a year and it seems like i am not alone had it for a few months now not holding charge anymore sounds ok though and live the fact that it's waterproof i bought a jbl clip one month ago and it lasted along with one battery life i only use it on the shower so it lasted for weeks but when i needed to recharge i got the same issue that many are complaining but mine i bought a used one so definitely the seller knew about this and sold me a defective product shame on both the seller and jbl worst product ever only boose from now on the audio breaks up a bit at a distance of feet quit charging one month after i purchased it sometimes the bluetooth doesn't play a song this product was amazing now it won't charge and i'm not eligible for support or a return exchange please assist works ok when connected via cable bluetooth operation is terrible audio distortion some equipment audio is terribly distorted oddly my macbook pro works fine does not jbl online chat support pleasant people told me that it is an issue related to bluetooth compatibility weird that the old macbook works and the new one does not range audio is choppy when passing through one wall made of simple sheet rock and at a distance of less than meters audio is distorted when connected via bluetooth and bluetooth range is terrible jbl online chat told me that they were sorry that the product did not meet my expectations my expectations were low just wanted it to work do not recommend this product have had it for a little over a month and it won't charge very disappointed out bucks it came broken i have sound problems worked great but then stopped taking a charge within months the product is far over priced it also is very difficult to pair with new android phone and had trouble with ipad there are superior products for much less money i did not test the water proof capability really loud surprisingly loud actually but the worse range i've seen on any speaker ever if its even half a foot away it starts breaking up good sound but frustrating that i can't use my phone at the same time because they need to be directly next to each other sounds good but the cord that is permanently attached to the speaker sucks it falls out of the groove that it fits into that surrounds the speaker after a month my speaker is not working after i left it charging the battery light is changing from red light to blue light it is not turning on and i also can not connect the bluetooth what can you do for me i bought it as a gift the sound quality is good but the product is not durable at all i used it for days at hour per day at most on the third day while the bluetooth connection works there's no sound output at all i tried the aux cord also no sound either i reset the speakers several times but it still doesn't work the bluetooth connection skips in and out even when i have it only feet away from my computer or phone otherwise love the color got teal and compactness doesn't skip when you use the included cord but then you have to keep it connected to your entertainment device wish the bluetooth connection was more solid sound is decent low end not great for a speaker of this size mine was defective and not waterproof bought it six months ago it stopped working in the water contacted seller through amazon and never got a response i recommend just buying it through the jbl website purchased in jan stopped holding a charge and pairing with my devices in june wrote to seller no response there are many reasons to like this light weight low profile clip it to your belt lasts hours and the sound isn't too bad however it died on me after the rd day it stopped charging sure i could have purchased a bad one but my experience has been where there is smoke there is fire decent for the price not as loud as i would have liked and the external cord seems akward to say the least small compact and easy to use never have any issues knock on wood with pairing easier to connect with my iphone then my beatsx that's designed to connect with my iphone lol defective and being returned because it would not connect via blue tooth as was promoted started making a hissing noise at any volume it lasted just long enough to so that i couldn't return it before the charger port went out charging port is poorly designed volume and sound are a bit low next time i'll get a bigger unit did alright for a while i hardly used it maybe to times now it is dead i purchased a jbl clip at the jbl store and it has a battery life of days of use i purchased this version to have a second to daisy chain and like many of the low rating reviews have stated the battery life is only a few hours this is not comparable to my first unit this model is also more slow and fussy to maintain blue tooth connection than my jbl store purchased model i think this may be a counterfeit version it is a great speaker i just would not buy it here i love the design the wrap around aux cable is awesome it sounded great was portable and presumably waterproof unfortunately i encountered a defect where it would continuously alternate flashing red and blue maybe trying to connect to bluetooth which essentially meant broken it wouldn't connect to bluetooth the aux input was disabled and there's no way to forcefully reset or power off the device great stuff but this hangup left me with a paperweight would buy again if the defects were ironed out but for now i can't trust it anymore even if i waited for the battery to die is it going to brick itself when i'm on vacation with no way to just power it off broke after the first week of use clips out at around hours of use very disappointed second time i have given jbl a chance back to bose i've tested and compared about a dozen wireless headsets and the jbl sound quality was always among the bottom sets and always overpriced for the quality of the product many other brands made better quality products for the price the same with this speaker i compared this jbl to the ue roll and altec lansing and this came out as the clear bottom it has the weakest in the can sound and as you turn the volume up louder its weaknesses become even more apparent of the the altec lansing the jacket h o is by far the best and highest sound quality both the jbl and the altec lansing work with your cell phone adjust volume and skip goback to the next song the altec lansing reaches a louder clear volume the ue roll does not and it also doesn't skip to the next song the cover just fell of on a regular workday went throughout all where i was today could not be found bummed its useless for me now i like this speaker because it is waterproof small and convenient also has great sound quality for a speaker of this size perfect for hikes since you can easily clip to your backpack the biggest downfall is that mine just randomly stopped charging after only months of use maybe i got a defective one but i was expecting this speaker to last for a couple years at least especially with jbl quality another downfall is that the charge when it worked would only hold for a few hours not like advertised i would only recommend this speaker for travel not suitable for daily use in my opinion was too big looked like it was a good speaker but you really have to look at the dimensions and draw them out so you can see how big it is this would be great for the beach or the car but i wanted something i could carry around and this was too big the speaker didn't charge defective the problem i have with mine is it does not last hours it's more like about hours then dies so i'm always having to charge it really pleasing fun teal color with orange clip nice clear sound quality and effortless pairing to my iphone sound quality ease of pairing ease of clip use and appearance of durability are better than clip original version i called jbl before i bought and got confirmation that original and clip can be daisy chained this is the reason i bought this speaker and i have been unsuccessful on daisy chaining very disappointed update i live in a medium sized older home with thick heavy walls and structure this is the only bluetooth device that is impervious to the dead zones crisp clear sound anywhere i use it in my house no cutting out or dropping off with iphone centrally located on middle floor impressive replacing the jbl micro wireless ultra portable speaker with this one was a huge disappointment sound quality as well as db were drastically reduced i use this exclusively for my mp players music the search goes on for my old ones equal after having the product for months it no longer works it just continually flashes blue and red i have reset it let it die and then recharged it it is a useless paperweight and not worth the i spent not up to par for jbl moderate quality sound doesn't always connect via bluetooth no wonder they put a cord on it after being connected for a long while it disconnects and makes a horrible static sound i use youtube to stream music and it has a delay at times that is unbearable spend the extra cash and get the bose speakers does not charge do not buy not as loud as i thought it would be and doesn't have skip system installed into speaker must manually skip from phone which is a pain each and every time not as loud as i would've liked the headphone jack is built into the speaker so if it breaks or gets a short the speaker is no longer viable jam is less expensive and a better speaker crap hours of music no more than that not impressed for now i believe i received what is commonly called a dud the speaker would pair perfectly fine with me galaxy s the issues began when i tried playing music it would play for a split second at a low volume then stop it wouldn't play longer then that or louder than a slighter whisper the aux cord was the exact same the charging was not successful either it would turn a red light on for about seconds then go completely black i purchased the item from a base exchange i'll return it in two days until then i'm out bucks and stuck with a horrifically malfunctioning speaker rubbish i received it as a gift love the sound and how easy is to pair it with your phone but can't skip songs straight from it you have to do it from your phone i'll give it if i was able to repeat songs or skip songs from the speaker itself great speaker depending on what you want it for i wanted a small battery powered monitor for practicing guitar i had been told that the previous product jbl clip had no latency using the mm cable i took a chance that the clip would be the same it's not the long delay when using the cable renders it unfit for purpose in fairness if you just want a portable speaker to listen to your tunes the clip is pretty nice i'm keeping it for that more conventional use the jbl clip is a good portable speaker but for the price i believe it should be a little louder this review would be a if the the the usb charging cord worked and probably should be only a because jbl uses a cheap quality charging cord i love the product and work great but i finally discovered that the reason i was unable to recharge or even use it plugged into my computer is because the charging cord doesn't work jbl please splurge and use something with a little quality i can tell that the usb end of the cord is cheap and doesn't have a secure connection like other usb cables cheap never wins i changed my mind after writing this i decided to rate it a because i expect more from jbl this was a gift and i received the speaker with the top of the box partially torn i've ordered and returned two the first emitted a loud hum and scratching sound when i turned it on it worked for about five minutes then quit the bluetooth on the second never worked i'm able to pair lots of devices to my ipad and cell phone including the first defective device but the second never paired i'm going to try a different speaker next time bought for daisy chain feature audio is choppy daisy chained cannot get more than hrs of play fully charged it's a great speaker but stars because i ordered the red color and recieved a black one too tired to return device i have a few jbl blue tooth speakers and this one does not sound good like my others fills the bill for an 'on the go' speaker gets loud enough for outdoors and the sound is clear i like the apparent ruggedness and waterproofing very little in the way of bass anything below about hz is inaudible unless at full volume but the sound is pleasing and reasonably full not 'tinny' sounding it would be good for outdoor activities am returning mine for two reasons volume is not as loud as i expected and the forward facing speaker does not spread the sound around as well as cheaper units such as the ihome speakers non bluetooth if i tried to listen to this speaker while bike riding i now realize i'd hardly be able to hear it i think these speakers have been over hyped the bluetooth stopped working and underdiscoverable i can't use it unless i plug the aux on my phone or computee i bought a pair of these one speaker never connected to anything the grey one being reviewed and the other will only connect to one bluetooth devices out seven that i tried including computers the 'daisy chain' function works when we got the one device to connect though the clip basically only works via the mm audiojack but that's not why i bought them furthermore the integrated audiojack cable is short and flimsy which means it will inevitably fray and wont be able to replace the cable turning them into a pair of paperweights i'm working abroad and can't return them anytime soon supremely disappointed in jbl and regret not spending the extra money on a more reliable competitor's product fair after minutes or so it goes to static and needs to be turned off and back on again wouldn't buy it again careful it lags when daisy chained when playing any video with just one speaker from my iphone it is in perfect sync but when daisy chained there is a noticeable and extremely annoying lag making it nearly impossible to watch the video i am giving this one star to put readers and jbl why didn't you admit this on your product information on notice otherwise the speaker quality itself is good but if you are buying to daisy chain two speakers and watch something it is terrible updated too bad i can't write two reviews one would be five stars the other one star five for a great sounding and expertly designed speaker one for the lag when watching a video with daisy chained speakers i have now purchased and returned count them different models of jbl portable bluetooth speakers this is by far the worst dropped signals refusal to pair correctly with iphone or ipad air it has major problem with youtube especially when you forward or rewind a video which i do often when it did pair it was decent but by day i had already printed the return label nice colors nice form factor ultraportable but if the bluetooth functionality is flawed the rest of its features hardly matter this flaw is throughout your product line i have a big blue party brv xxl monster superstar bose soundlink jawbone big jambox and never ever had bluetooth functionality issues very sad indeed i bought this after a phillips speakers was a bust this was much better in that the speaker worked quite a distance away from the phone or ipad however the sound quality was really disappointing love this product but the seller couldn't read and got me a red instead of a black the red is bright and does not fit with my setup and taste would have given star if the color was black i guess its a good product i receive a defective unit no light when chargin no red ligh or blinkin wont turn on i should have bought from waltmar the price its cheaper and if its defevtive i dont have to wait days to get a new one i wont even send this back goin straigh to the trash it doesn t work anymore only use it twice while this blender was great at first it did not stand the test of time the lid started leaking first and then a piece on the bottom of the pitcher fell off won t be buying this again i love my ninja but after two months the lid won t lock anymore so i have to hold it down in order for it to still blend i ve been so careful to take excellent care of my ninja so that it would last a long time i feel like it s already falling apart does a horrible job blending anything so saddening we tried for months hoping maybe it was operator error but it can't handle basic ice smoothies unfortunate didn t come with the blade in the middle so i was unable to use the product couldn't ever get this to blender to start assembled and aligned all the parts correctly and followed all of the troubleshooting tips just to be stuck with the blinking red light of death will be returning and trying an oster instead works well but carafe started cracking within a year for morning smoothies this blender is very big taking up a lot of space and making it very hard to wash without a dishwasher this blender is absolutely excellent if you exclusively use it to blend whole pieces of fruit and veggies personally i make a lot of smoothies with items such as yogurt and protein powder added in the trouble is it has this very long three bladed pillar that extends almost all the way to the lid from the bottom if you are trying to add in a powder or something like yogurt it catches on all the blades which means that unless you planned to fill the blender all the way to the top that stuff won't make it into your smoothie and will instead stick and you have to scrape it in and blend again also it's ridiculously powerful even on the low setting which again isn't good if you only want to make less than maximum capacity since it splatters everywhere and you either lose a lot or have to sit there and scrape it all out with a spatula overall it's just a lot of trouble unless you are using it to full capacity every time this is my second time using this blender and the top half is stuck on and it won't even turn on the power light just flashes used it last week and it worked great i was very happy with this blender when i first tried it i have always had dollar blenders so this was a step up because it is much more powerful i make smoothies and blend cauliflower for mash sometimes but the primary reason for purchase was to make bulletproof coffee every morning upon first use for bp coffee it produced froth like i have never had and it was truly delicious the reason i landed on this blender is because after doing research for the best blender specifically for bp coffee this was recommended if you are not willing to splurge for a vitamix or blendtec at this point i may have to do that because even this blender has already cracked and is leaking after less than a month's use luckily i am still in the return frame for amazon so they are sending me a new one i also purchased warranty upon doing more research people say in order to keep blenders from cracking when making bp coffee you must release the air pressure out of the blender by taking off the top after no more than blending for seconds then you can put the top back on and blend for additional time if needed i am going to try this method and hopefully it will keep it from cracking it was delivered today but it is completely broken what should i do i generally found the blender to work well however within the first few washes in the dish washer the handle melted making putting the lid on difficult for that reason alone i would not purchase again for the price i was hoping my smoothies would be more creamy unfortunately the results are no better than my old cuisinart blender my package was left in the lobby a of my buliding and i live on the four floor plastic everywhere even the jar is plastic pathetic really but it is what it is how ever long the warranty is will be time to start hunting another this is no vita mix it does it's job but it's really loud i had read that in the reviews but thought well yea it's a blender of course it's loud but it's louder than your average you'd think with all that noise it'd be super efficient but it surprising takes a little more encouragement than my old hamilton beach blender that burnt out after years item box was open and had holes in it when delivered brand new easy to clean compared to the other brand i had but its not automatic in its timing for various tasks so you have to guess when the fruits or vegetables are ready i make smoothies daily and the ones from the ninja are gritty where as my previous blender the nutribullet made it creamy and smooth but that was hard to clean works well but very cheaply made poor quality don t expect it to last for years the blade is not safe and difficult to clean i have only used it a few times but i can tell it is not going to last poor construction and plastic blender jar seems fragile pros easy to use cleans easy in dishwasher blends thoroughly safe locking starting mechanism cons ninja customer service is a joke if something fails weak pitcher latch on ours broke days after purchase was told a replacement pitcher was warranty was only valid if purchased directly from them and only covered the motor base lid and pitcher are not no day guarantee or years warranty updating my review years after purchase i loved my blender but it literally broke into pieces after only a year and change a few months after i got it a crack started to form and eventually just broke wide open keep in mind i only used this to make smoothies it wasn't heavily used or anything i'm so disappointed my thrift store blender lasted longer than this i expect much more for this price no comparison with my old breville blander it blends well i don't like cleaning the blade because it's easy to get cut i never write reviews but this is such a horrible blender for what you pay i had to write a review another reviewer wrote it takes the smooth out of smoothie and he couldn t be more right i m not sure how this blender got so many good reviews so many times i tried making my smoothies and a a bowls and had to stick a spoon in the blender and push all the chunks to the center because they wouldn t blend i end up dumping my smoothie into my nitribullet to get all the chunks out of it the designers went wrong when they decided to put three sets of blades going up all it does is send everything flying to the sides making me have to constantly scrape the sides of the blender the lowest setting is still too high ugh i need a vitamix dead on arrival terrible customer service with phone numbers hard to get through i loved this blender when i first bought it but after owning it for only a few monthsw i found that this dishwasher safe blender is not dishwasher safe i always place the lid and blades on the top rack but the main part of the blender can only fit on the lower rack over weveral washings it melted it just enough that the lid would no longer go on i called ninja and they replaced it but told me that it could only be replaced one time per costomer i never put my new one in the dishwasher but after a few months of using it it was also defective i was blending frozen fruit for a smoothie and the plastic sides just exploded open it is no longer usable this blender is too expensive for the short amount of time that it it will last don't buy it the pitcher literally cracked after the third use with frozen fruit i purchased the other ninja set master prep pro a while ago i love it use it a lot but decided i wanted a tall blender of course i picked the ninja first of all look at the price and watts on this watts for soooo much less than the vitamix the newest vitamix is hp watts for over yikes don't get me wrong they are a great machine but for those of us who don't need programmable timers hot soup and ultra silky smooth baby food this ninja is the best out there this does just about everything the high priced one does i use this for smoothies this can take anything you give it and blend it right up i make frozen fruit yogurts add the frozen fruit to fat free yogurt i use home made almond milk yogurt i use it for banana icecream whip up frozen banana pieces takes a couple seconds with this then add peanut butter chocolate nuts whatever you want i use betty lou's powdered fat free peanut butter of course you have to be careful handling the ultra sharp blades i remove the blade assembly by the tip and set it inside the sink i continue to hold just the top tip and use a bottle brush to clean the blades i carefully set it back in the clean blender and let it air dry it doesn't rust i also make my own sauces and dressings the grand kids like the snow cones this ninja makes i use diluted sugar free torani and davinci coffee syrups brands amazon carries i especially like the simplicity of the buttons low medium and high full speed and pulse what more does anyone need you just can't get a more powerful quality blender than this for the price update well it did blend the soft frozen fruit banana strawberries and blueberries but i later tried mango and pineapple not so good chunks no matter how long i blended i guess it has limitations this item didn't work can seem to be able to return it this is a poorly designed blender the owner's guide says the pitcher is dishwasher safe however the four corners of the pitcher have plastic attachments that collect dishwasher gunk we have to use a screwdriver to unscrew each of the plastic corners to keep the pitcher clean recently one of those plastic corners broke off unexpectedly furthermore this blender has never blended ice well i would not purchase this blender again this would be ok for fruit smoothies we are using more for veggie juice and although it says it can handle green veggies it can't i don't like to chew my green drink so had to send it back blender itself works fine but the parts are made cheap i dropped the lid and it broke these parts should not break in the kitchen with everyday use now i have to purchase a lid for i don't like this blender at all it's too powerful and ruined both things i tried to make the blades are also so sharp that i cut myself twice already i'm just going to buy a cheap blender somewhere else terrible performance and lack of power does not do its primary job which is to blend ingredients together to be one great size price and power one problem the container cracks at the bottom i brought the first one back because cracks showed up and got another same problem i noticed there are clear plastic stickers at the bottom maybe to keep the cracks from growing i don't know but i didn't want to have the thing break open and have a big mess to clean up as someone else mentioned in their review this blender takes the smooth out of smoothie no matter how long i blend there are still massive chunks in my smoothie and it's nearly undrinkable look at the variety of user uploaded photos and you'll see what i mean also this blender was shipped in it's original box with no discreet packaging whatsoever so the whole neighborhood including potential thieves knew exactly what it was as it sat on my front porch it also means that the box i have to return it in the original packaging is already beat up from shipping the first time i honestly have no idea how this blender has been so popular it is the worst blender i have ever used including other cheaper blenders i liked the way it worked but we purchased of them and each one only lasted a month it started leaking where it attaches to the base when we returned the nd to the same place we just got our money back i called ninja to speak to someone to see if they had any suggestions the first person said since you went thru of them in such a short time it is obvious to me that you used it wrong i let her know that we did not ever put them in the dishwasher or use harsh soap etc it was supposed to be able to crush ice and that is when it leaked the most she suggested that we purchase another one and also the dollar warranty that is good for days we only paid dollars for it and the warranty does not cover mailing the product back and forth to be fixed i tried to call back again to see if i could leave a complaint with their survey and she hung up on me when i tried to call back they had blocked my number because i am bilingual i called again and chose the spanish line this gentleman only offered me to create an account with them so i could receive emails for promotions i asked if i could leave a complaint and he said there wasn't any way to do that i went on their website and there wasn't away to leave a complaint my only other option was to leave one here on amazon so other people will know that they don't stand behind their products very sad these days that no one seems to care about the consumer only how to make more money from you my next step is to write a letter by snail mail since their website does not allow you to leave comments i am so disappointed the pitcher is very badly cracked which i found out while using it for the first time smoothie sprayed everywhere the machine works well just poor quality control damaged product item was used and had a huge hole in the side of the box there wasn't even any other box they shipped it in just the ninja box itself ridiculous the container broke blending ice i'm disappointed i need a new jar will send pics at another time the blender works okay didn't actually liquify my smoothie ingredients noticeably the spinach just chopped it up very fine my chief complaint is that it's just too tall the space between my countertop and upper kitchen cabinets is it doesn't fit unless i pull it to the front of the countertop and i had planned to leave it out instead of store it between uses so that won't work refurbished be careful to look into the product details to see if it is a refurbished item or not the blender did it's job when it worked but it didn't last months it was delivered jan and stopped working feb i will be pursuing ways to get compensated for this i ve had this blender for about months blends great but very loud i started noticing a gray sludge coming out of where the blade connects to the lid if i blend my smoothie too long the sludge splashed into the pitcher and into my smoothie pretty disgusting i wash it well every time but the sludge is always there it s too late to return but i won t be buying another ninja super powerful but doesn't pick food off the floor so that the first loaded food gets crushed and the top parts are barely cut arrived a didn t work will not buy anothe ninja product again difficult to wash lid locking mechanism broke within months and ninja refused to replace the defective lid do no recommend terrible customer service last product that i will ever buy from this company only has a day warranty on parts besides motor this is the first time my three young children are all napping in the afternoon of all the many many things i could be doing right now i chose to write this review because i hate this blender so much let's count the ways shall we the blade and blade holder is huge and does not allow larger chunks of fruit or vegetables to be placed inside the container the blades are all placed on the side and none in the center bottom of the blade holder meaning there is no centrifugal force meaning that the blades scatter the components of your smoothie all over the container instead of towards the center bottom of the container this means that you cannot open the lid to add more liquid or fruit as it is blending the blades are not locked into place and fall out when you pour it is unnecessarily loud heavy and clunky it does not blend properly it is about as effective as a mortar and pestle so in the spirit of fairness i gave this thing two stars as it does sort of blend things and if you want to use it to make fruit smoothies i suppose it does the job however if you want to make any creamy soups vegetable smoothies or sauces you are better off with a regular oster my cheap blender does a more thorough job and gets less dirty i finally thought i was rid of this nightmare when it after only a year with maybe bi weekly use it crapped out on me the manufacturer offered to send me a new motor but i was to pay the shipping thanks but no thanks verdict not even as good as a cheap blender does kind of blend i saw several reviews of this blender accompanied by pictures of lacerations i thought to myself i've been using food processors and other kitchen tools that have sharp removable blades for years with no problems well i have managed to avoid any injuries however i have more sympathy for those people than i did before for the following two reasons the three tiers of blades mean that there is no safe way to dry this without blades sticking up in the air unlike a knife or a food processor blade where you can lay it flat standing it upright the way it sits in the carafe will make it prone to tipping over the top part where you must hold the blade is small tapered and difficult to grip firmly with wet hands my other complaint is that because of the three tiered blade assembly it is impossible to safely push things down into the blender i make smoothies five days a week and the kale that i used to just press down to the bottom so that other ingredients would fit i now have to blend for a moment to make room not a huge chore but it slows me down i don't love the locking lid and i fear the plastic moving parts will break before the blender wears out but i've been using this several days a week for five months and that's still working fine bottom line it blends reliably i'm not going to replace it but i wouldn't buy it again sorry to go against the grain here but i think this blender really sucks it will chip ice i ll give it that but spinach pumpkin and sunflower seeds even chunky peanut butter are left in huge straw blocking chunks even after running on high for minutes my husband says the blade design does not create centrifugal force to suck the ingredients to the bottom and pulverize them all i know is it won t chop the ingredients i ve listed above i used this blender one time and a piece of the spout broke off after one hand washing very frustrated with this product don't buy this one because later you will not be able to find cups for it honestly this is the most overpriced and frustrating piece of garbage it's a blender it shouldn't be rocket science to get it to work i went through every troubleshooting step and could never get this to start blending this is the second incredibly overpriced item i've bought from ninja that doesn't work and i will never buy from them again complete waste of time and money i found immediate issues with this design you cannot pour anything in like powder supplements while the blender is in motion if you take the lid off and try to pour out contents the blender blades fall out sometimes a thick substance cannot fit through that pour hole locking safety mechanisms to even turn this on the lid must go on in a certain way and the blender has to be locked onto the motor a certain way is such overkill this is a massive blender and for people you hardly fill it i decided to return mine after use works and functions perfectly out of the box i would give it stars if it were not made in china i had one of these i gave it away to my girlfriend in tijuana mexico tj i bought a vitamix at costco in tj and it is triple the price of this ninja but the vitamix is times more useful if you can afford it go for the vitamix the machine is working ok but it looks like it was in a refurbished box i wanted to love this machine i was looking to upgrade my single serve nutri bullet and read the reviews on this and was very excited to try it i put my regular smoothie ingredients to the blender which included spinach and kale it handled the frozen fruits well but it would not blend up the kale no matter what i did i ran it on high speed for a while nothing poured it all out and back in to make sure nothing was sticking to the sides and things were poured it all back in and put it on high once more poured it into my cup and took a sip of my chewy greens blah it doesn't even come close to my nutri bullet i poured a some into my nutribullet and first try it was nice and smooth greens what greens just like it i will be buying the larger nutri bullet next less than months old and the lid handle is separating i have to hold the top down to get it to run looks like i'd have to replace both lid and container at about the cost of a new blender not impressed my cheapo blender did the same job maybe even better this was a gift broke and stopped working after times of use lots of power but too much for a plastic blender mine has cracks in the bottom and smoothies leak out just waiting for it to fall apart pros very powerful blends well cons its huge storing it is a challenge it's loud and hard to clean stuff gets stuck in all crevices and the sharp blades make it hard to scrub had to replace my new one within a week would rate performance as fair i think what i really need is a vitamix spinach leaves do not blend up completely i'm still chewing them slightly in my green juice i have used this thing twice and already there are stress cracks in the base of the plastic pitcher not causing leaks yet but quality is substandard for this price sold me a defected blender which stopped working after uses unacceptable worked for months then suddenly quit will not power on working with ninja to try and resolve i thought it would really work better as i heard the ninja was killer on smoothies i have to leave it run for longer periods to get everything smooth quickly stopped working i was originally very happy with this blender it worked very well but after a few months with no more than normal use using about times a week for smoothies and such i had a huge crack in the pitcher they sent me a new one at no charge but about months later it cracked again in places they wouldn t take care of it for me i was very disappointed as i have only had it for about months a replacement pitcher is almost the same price as a brand new one i will be tossing this and will have to invest in a different model hey i ordered a ninja mixer for you and it does not work i ask you to send me a new one or give me back my money this does not blend or make creamy smoothies very disappointed my nutri bullet blends much better the one on the right is the ninja professional and one on the left is my nutri bullet it blends well and cost less i think i'll keep will be returning this high cost blender doesn't grind up fruit finely enough however it is rather quiet compared to other blenders do not purchase this product if you intend to use it as a blender i purchased the bl and within a month or two the pin that presses down the button to unlock the safety feature had snapped off every morning i have to use a sharp object to press down the button to make the machine work is it terrible no annoying yeah drop an extra hundred and upgrade to a vitamix buyer beware used the unit twice well third time is a charm plugged the blender into wall and wouldn t turn on tried mutiple outlets throughout the house and still no good disappointing i bought this blender in december as a christmas present for my daughter the blender worked great for a year however yesterday the lid wouldn't come off we had to press really hard on the 'release' button to get the lid off i called ninja customer service and they said that since the blender is no longer under warranty they couldn't do anything they said i could purchase a new picher and lid for i only paid for the whole thing they don't sell separate lids for this product you have to buy a set buyer beware i will never buy another ninja product again there was a crack in the plastic when this blender arrived but it didn t seem to compromise the ability of the blender six months later however the blender leaks all over the base every time it is used we are very disappointed in the quality of this blender in comparison to the price hate it so let me start by saying that i had a real ninja before this one i dropped it and broke it so here i go and purchase this one for a great deal unfortunately when this blender arrived and from the very first time i used it once i turn it on to blend the contents splash out through the top i guess the lid doesnt fit properly or maybe its the rubber on the lid that isnt good either way in order for it not to splash out i need to tightly hold down the lid while it blends and when its time to pour im supposed to easily lift the corner and pour however when i pour it comes pouring out around the whole lid making a huge mess i have to remove the entire lid and blade in order to free pour big waste of my money and time we returned it we mainly wanted it for making protein shakes they were very thick undrinkable when researching a fix it said to add fluid to decrease the viscosity but it only got worse not worth the we spent our blender worked better for our purposes i am surprised at how many stars this blender has i have had it for two years i purchased it excitedly after my cheap one gave out i am disappointed it does not have different blending options such as crush blend puree etc it does not completely blend up items like spinach or nuts in my smoothies the lid does not stay down tight on its own causing the machine to stop blending and i have to hold down the lid with some force in order to use i do like it for times when i still want to leave bigger chunks such as when making salsa but as my only blender it does not cut it also it is hard to clean the underside of the pitcher somehow i have stuff under there and the lid has a crevice in the pour spout that is hard to get clean does the job not as good as i thought my beloved and expensive breville recently broke and after much researching decided to get this as a replacement the pitcher definitely feels and sounds cheap thin like it wants to break i swear every time i use it the ice cubes are going to crack it i use it mostly for protein powder shakes after the gym unfortunately the square shape means that powder gets in the corners and stays there also despite using every possible setting i can't get it to blend the ice well i always feel the need to the shake a bit as bigger ice chips always remain i always hand wash which is easy yay this immediately after using and after just a month condensation is collecting in the handle not cool i do like the spout opening in the lid which ensures that big blobs of shake or smoothie don't make messes as you pour this is an ok blender but feels like it wants to break and i'm not impressed with its functionality prob wouldn't buy again honestly i expected more i kind of miss my kitchenaid that we got for our wedding i suppose i could have brought a more expensive model but the brand s reputation had me thinking this would work fine it does the job but it doesn t liquify as quickly as i expected and can require more liquid than i d like to use works fine but the blades are dangerous cleaning them is a bit scary the only benefit is its crushing power if you want smoothies all you will get is pulp and chunks i am really not sure what is useful about owning this i bought this blender and used it for three days making a smoothie in the morning the third day it wouldn t crush the ice and started smoking the plastic piece that was part of the mechanism had melted and was smoking i had our hazed the protection plan but it wouldn t cover the replacement because it was accidental damage the only accident was buy my this cheap blender terrible quality does not blend food well especially in corners of blender my wife and i bought this a few months back as we were in need of a blender we thought we would spend a little more money as we do a lot of shakes coffee and puree after using it for about a month we noticed small hairline cracks starting around the bottom of the blender unfortunately it has just got worse if attempted to make any coffee drinks or a more liquid smoothie it comes out the bottom i usually can still use it to puree some foods but i was using it today to puree a sweet potato and now that is starting to seep out as well i gave it stars as it blends really wells and i like how it connects into the base but just broke so fast i was hoping this would be a cheaper version of a vitamix but it just does not live up it especially fails at green smoothies which are left chunky and unappetizing we re going to get rid of this and get a vitamix does not blend smoothies well especially if you use chia seeds smoothies come out anything but smooth this is suppose to be the exact same replacement for my previous ninja but i can tell it's not the parts just look and feel cheaper it's hard to describe but my original one never moved around when blending and felt heavier the parts felt more durable thia does the job but i worry about longevity not as strong as you would think for a planned obsolescence the pitcher broke as pitchers do for a new one the price of a whole new blender don t buy i loved this blender until the tiny plastic locking clip broke off at the base of the pitcher after a month of use i bought the warranty but they refused to warranty it and said to deal directly with ninja i have tried to get a hold of ninja waiting hours on hold no answer no help no warranty replacement i'll never buy the warranty or the blender again difficult to lock down and use always a problem garbage this thing is a beast it's over tall when assembled the base is huge and the whole shebang eats up a ton of counter space i don't live in a mcmansion i have an older home with limited countertops and this monster occupies way too much real estate for something that will realistically get used three times per week to make smoothies i'd say it's at least larger than your typical household blender sending it back will get something else in a sane size range ok but my bullet works better doesn't really do the best job of blending things like spinach to a point where they're just part of the larger smoothie like you're going to notice the spinach bits these things need to have a bigger drive than the 'nail' size that attaches the driver breaks far too easy a crack developed on the bottom of the blender after only four days of use started leaking everywhere incredibly disappointing given the high praise these have received i'm really disappointed i have owned this blender for just over one month and i loved it at first good motor big pitcher however the blender's pitcher is really scratched up despite me being extremely gentle with it and hand washing it only it is just not very durable and the pitcher looks to be kind of cheaply made at this point it's really hard to clean because of how many cracks and crevices are in it i didn't expect this much wear tear after one month especially when i have only put things like bananas and fruit in it wouldn't buy this again i would just save up for a vitamix or something blender jar broke while in use shot all over the house i purchased this blender in october now a month later it is totally useless the lid will no longer lock into position making it impossible for the machine to start a total waste of money christmas surprise ruined no discretion intended gift recipient now knows what they ll be receiving however it was delivered promptly the plastic pitcher cracked and leaking two months after purchase with seconds daily usage blending coffee and butter only recourse is warranty which requires us to pay shipping costs which are half the price of the blender didn t come in a standard shipping box just the product box box was beaten and basically opened i can t tell if it s used or not i tested the unit out and it seems to work but the box seemed like everything should have been broken today i went to use my ninja and it won t turn on so i thought i d return it for another one according to amazon the cut off date to return this blender was yesterday frustrated to say the least didn t even use it for days allisonmelias comcast net plastic container broke the first time i used it i ve never given star before but this product is very cheap broke less than months after i purchased not worth it it is more like a chopper than a blender the blender is fine but the pitcher keeps cracking almost immediately i had a replacement pitcher sent after a month of use and the first time i use the replacement there was a crack forming it took a few weeks or so for the corner to completely break off and more cracks are forming around the base still i reached out to ninja and i would have to pay for a nd replacement which seems crazy since this is clearly a defect i'm only using this to make smoothies with frozen blueberries and bananas mostly so there should be no reason that this keeps happening i bought mine from fred meyer the blade broke in use and the replacement is buyer beware nice concept however the entire operations and use comes down to a improperly designed and fragile tab that is easy to break off and renders the blender useless after the fact i have read this is a common problem with the blender see red light blinks now i have a watt paper weight i purchased the extended warranty from square trade via amazon and the just referred me to the manufacture not what i expected will not purchase from manufacture again amazon you let me down i wanted to really like this product based on all the positive reviews i read i bought it in august and now it's november and the pitcher has cracked i used it may be once a week to blend smoothies the pitcher is not covered by their year warranty which is ridiculous like it's an extra part or something to return the product you have to pay is it worth it you decide for yourself worked well for months then started leaking this is not dishwasher safe as it is advertised melted in just three washes worst part is the manufacturer doesn t stand by their products and offered us a replacement jar for works well if you fill it all the way up not great for single serving smoothies leaves chunks and doesn t make into liquid at all also it s real loud i've had this product just over months and have used it x yesterday i was mixing ice cubes and frozen fruit and the drive motor started making an extremely loud noise that sound as though the drive shaft bearings went out it eventually stopped working after about minutes its a course blender so there may be small bits of food if you like the course blend the blades are very sharp like knives so i expected a more liquefied blend you can get a smoother blend but it takes a very long time it chops ice well enough but the spout is way too small to add anything other than liquids while blending it disassembles well for cleaning pros crushes ice cons won't engage without the lid being attached no way to add ice while blending lots of product remains on blades lid this is a great blender i have no complaints about how it works but as other have said the inside blade is not attached the blade cut my hand and it required stitches be careful a warning the ninja bl lists it's height as inches in the description it's full height is this will not fit under many kitchen cupboards most kitchen cabinets are about above the counter top the problem arises for those who have under cabinet lighting and or a front valance on their cabinets which many do the front valence will take the front cabinet under clearance down to to have attached a couple of photos have not used and will likely send it back i used this blender once and a small part broke off of the bottom of the pitcher and it won't work anymore i expected more from this product due to the price and brand name i have had this blender for about years and was initially thrilled with it it worked so much better than my year old blender however within months the plastic pitcher developed a crack which quickly went all the way from the top to the base we taped it and continued to use it for about a year until we ordered a replacement pitcher which cost about another criticism i have of the design is that the pitcher is square and that sometimes causes pieces of whatever you're trying to blend to get stuck in the corners you then must stop the machine and use a spatula or some other tool to dislodge those pieces and mix them in to the rest of the liquid today was the last straw the metal screw that connects the spinning gear to the motor just came apart while i was making cream into butter that renders the entire thing useless of course the warranty is only years so i have no recourse very disappointing not what i expected but it's not the product it's me i thought i was getting something smaller my mistake it's great for it's designed for but i'll give it away to one of the grandkids makes the shake into a freeze terrible way to difficult i purchased a ninja blender and have been very dissatisfied with it i only make blended coffee in it each morning coffee milk ice and have to wipe brownish goop out of the bottom every morning after i rinse it out it looks and feels like a thick lubricant it s gross blades went dull in weeks not worth the money ok so here's the deal on this guy it works great does what it's suppose to do however there's a molding flaw with the plastic pitcher my first one cracked on the bottom i don't put ice in my smoothies but i do put in frozen fruit called shark ninja and they gladly replaced it when i got it and was washing it out and lo and behold in the bottom same hair line crack so you know it's going to open up more eventually called shark and made them aware so now they are aware that there's a problem so if you have one don't be afraid to call and make them aware hopefully they will remedy this problem should have gone with my first instincts a bought a glass one do not buy this blender i received this blender as a christmas gift and it is simply the worst blender i have ever come across in my life the design seems cool on the surface but in actuality it's just plain terrible the multiple blade design makes it incredibly difficult to get ingredients in to begin with as well as being scary af when you are cleaning them or if you forget to pull them out before pouring like i did twice they will come flying out i'm amazed more people haven't lost fingers due to this since reflexively you will try to stop them from falling you would think the multiple blades would ensure a smooth blend but somehow it does the opposite and just flings it all to the sides never creating a vortex drawing it to the blades whereas in a conventional blender the blades are in the bottom and suck all the contents down to them i don't know how else to explain it also the square design of the vessel causes ingredients to get trapped in the corners on top of the not blending in general even attempting to periodically scrape the sides to help it along is freakin' impossible because the darn blades are in the way just all around an absolutely terrible design the attempts at making green smoothies in this thing resulted in transferring the partially blended contents into my year old single serve smoothie blender every time like literally couldn't get the liquid to turn green in the ninja even after minutes of blending just reduced the greens to tiny confetti but as soon as i put it in the nutribullet bam the kale and spinach are pulverized and turn the liquid green unless you're the kind of heathen who likes their smoothies not smooth and prefer to chew them avoid this product at all costs i'm still not satisfied with this product the fact that the blade attachment is loose and only secures when locking it with the lid is annoying and dangerous it blends very well of course that's why i bought it arrived with spider crack on base would be good if pitcher didn't have the crack delivered sept used twice and the mechanism in the pitcher was destroyed the second time ended up with ground plastic in my sauce would not recommend under any circumstance i couldn't even get a return or refund i can't figure out how this blender has such a good rating i've owned mine for a couple of years now and every time i use it usually for smoothies i'm consistently disappointed the motor is powerful but it doesn't blend how it should my smoothies are not smooth it seems like part of the problem is the design the square pitcher gets chunks of food stuck in the corners i feel like if it were redesigned and made to be round instead it would work really well i wish i would have sprung for a vitamix instead even my old oster worked better piece of crap bought in august and didnt use until sept to do my smoothies for my weighloss challenge broke in oct don't waste your money this seems to be the imitation second one we received the lid doesn't seal amazon will not refund since it was a replacement to the original and the return for refund time has expired do not buy this item do not buy this garbage the lid won't close because it came defective so there's no way to turn it on do yourself a favor and buy from a different brand this item was shipped in the manufacturer s box with a shipping label on it not in an anonymous shipping box fyi not at all pleased blender does not make smooth smoothies will not grind kale or berries completely i will be going back to using my nutra bullet not impressed i thought this would be great for turning kale spinisch chard and other fruits and vegetables into smooth liquid it does not do that you will still have bits and chunks of product in the smoothie i feel this is only slightly better than my oyster blender however at almost bucks i would take the oyster back or i would spend more money for a real smoothie blender and not this knock off brand found a cheaper one from costco after few weeks after i bought this one it doesn t make smooth drinks i don't understand how people gave it star ratings for this blender it doesn't blend carrots and fruits well enough to make smoothies the side blades can't reach the ingredients at the bottom and leaves large chunks even when it blends soft things with enough fluid the consistency is too think to drink with a straw i spent more money on a vitamix instead have any of these star reviews been from people who have used a real blender everything on this is cheap feeling plastic you can let the contents blend forever and it will never be smooth it is awkward super loud underperforming and huge the suction cups in the bottom of the base are handy and necessary it will make decent smoothies and makes hummus fairly well in my professional opinion years of professionally cooking and baking this product is average at best realistically if you want something solid then look elsewhere vitamix and blendtec never disappoint the ninja blender has is a very powerful motor but unfortunately the plastic jar is not as durable after one month i saw a crack in the base of the jar but couldn't return it since the return period has lapsed now the blender is useless unless i get a replacement jar it would definitely make sense if there was a chance to buy just the replacement jars because the motor can last much longer thanks maria does not crush ice very well for smoothies or mixed drinks need more higher speeds bulky doesn't blend smoothly the lid malfunctioned constantly i would not recommend this for the price i bought this blender based on the reviews i am dumbfounded i use a blender daily to make smoothies for my family for breakfast i've been through a few this is the worst and i'll tell you why there is a center removable metal rod with blades around it and all the way up it so every time you wash it you have to handle the blades multiple times yes there is a section of the rod without blades but one must be vigilant to only touch this small section or you will be sliced additionally when placing smoothie items in blender one can not push down the spinach for fear of slicing oneself in that process my other blenders have all has the blades at the base and i can see why i never had a problem with any of those blenders as a matter of fact the other blenders did a better job of pureeing my smoothie ingredients this blender left chunks of avacado on the inside of the blender that were hard to clean off again something i never experienced with other blenders we received this blender on august and love it the only problem is that it's months old and it already has a giant crack in the pitcher my husband uses it daily to make his shakes but it should hold up better than months item showed up in a box that had been torn apart and looked terrible also not fond of the slicer that comes out i cut my hand the first time i used it and you can put anything if it while it's going you have to stop take the lid off put whatever else you want in it then resume not simple the only problem i have with this unit is that the lid leaks this is a design flaw that the company has not yet acknowledged the lid is manufactured out of two plastic parts that are factory sealed together however while washing or just rinsing water gets into the lid between the parts this water later leaks out into the glass when pouring the next time the blender is used that's gross having dirty water dripping into your fresh made smoothie i contacted the ninja company and at first they did not want to replace the defective lid since i did not buy the unit directly from them however after i reminded them of the one year guarantee against defects they did agree to send a new lid as a one time special exemption the second lid also leaks same as the first i would not recommend this model because of the leaking lid i have had my ninja for several years and overall it is great it has held up nicely it is nice and powerful for smoothies ice etc i would definitely recommend it except for one major issue the square design of the blender bowl is horrible every time i use it smoothies blending dough etc lots of the food gets stuck in the square corners where the blades don't reach so multiple times during every use i have to stop it open it up scrape the food out of the corners with a spoon or spatula blend some more and repeat it is super annoying this could be fixed very simply by making the bowl round instead of square so that there are no corners for the food to escape the blades and get stuck i would buy this blender again in a heartbeat if they changed this stupid square design this broke less than months in it no longer turns on and is thus entirely useless the bottom of the blender has warped and can not place it on the mixer part cannot use need to return to sharkninja for refund please contact me danielle weaver the carafe cracked before i had used it ten times this is a nice blender gets the job done this blender is not as strong as i thought it would be but for the price it's a good blender the lid is not sealed so water gets in it while cleaning it doesn't dry well so it's not exactly clean the cup is also difficult to clean i returned it this blender gets the job done for the most part some ice doesn't blend well so you have to blend it longer then add more ice because the smoothie becomes liquid the bottom of the blender where the screws are have discolored and i've only had it for almost months overall for the price i paid i can't complain i've had this blender for almost years and today it went into the trash i was excited to get it and it initially did a good job of blending in spite of the very loud noise louder than our other blender it was working well for about six months then the blades got dull and it took longer to blend the cannister lid opening cover popped off a year ago and yesterday the entire lid disintegrated i will purchase a different brand model next do not but this i purchased this and it was delivered on september nd today is september th and it quit working today i am so unhappy and angry right now i don't have money to waste and that is exactly what happened it worked well for the first few months but then the blades became very dull we have a green smoothie every morning with lots of vegetables the smoothies were becoming more and more 'chunky' and hard to get through even a huge smoothie straw i tried to get a replacement part but there are none for this model since we realized that we are very committed to daily green smoothies we ended up buying a vitamix and wow what a huge difference i never knew that you didn't have to 'chew' a green smoothie the ninja never blended our smoothies to a puree consistency the ninja is fine for some things but it doesn't compare to a vitamix did not blend well too big gave it away not even months old only used maybe times stoped working power button blinks but nothing works i have all the arrows lined up everything on right nothing went online and so many people bought this blender have same problem waste of money no stars for me we bought this item less than months ago and it already doesn't work all the ninja blenders i've used work well but cleaning them is tricky look at the blade embedded pole at the center of all ninjas and imagine trying to grip it and scrub between the blades without slicing your hand do not let stuff dry on the blades or you'll have a dangerous time cleaning them my first ninja the container got all cracked up using frozen berries in it it was not attractive so i bought a new one the second one the cover didn't stay on snuggly resulting in it shutting itself off this is the third and last one i will try the cover is not fitting as well just like the previous one they work great until they don't worst blender this blender worked for about weeks and then it cracked on the side and was leaking everywhere we did nothing cause it to crack my cheap blender lasted years yet this one only lasted a month and broke lightweight not too hard to use but drinks have too much residue been using it with celery and kale and it s like chewing your drink not smooth at all send it to my dad as a birthday gift didn't work at all not even one time they try in different outlets and nothing didn't even turn on waste of money very disappointed my blender died and i tested this one before choosing a new one this frankenblender seems to have been designed for millennials who have never used a blender and don't know how much they are supposed to cost it is very difficult to clean for all you kiddies out there who think a regular blender can't handle ice just get a blender and you will see that handling ice and making very fine smoothies is one of the main things it is designed for and without the strange hard to clean blades works nice but is a pain to clean do not like that the blade pops out the size of the blender is such that it does noy fit under the cabinets it does not make super smooth smoothies ir maybe i have to let ot run a long time while the blender works fine it does not blend my morning smoothie as smooth as i would like it to be i have run this blender with a carrot kale banana and and apple in it for up to minutes and there are still small chunks of carrot left in the mix i am disappointed by that otherwise the blender works fine came with a broken part on the pitcher that caused it not to register that it was locked on unit would not work anniversary gift fail have only used it twice but it seems to be that it's intended use is more for liquid type foods trying chopping cabbage in it for slaw larger pieces stuck to the cup sides with the multiple blades it's somewhat difficult to scrape loose had i known i probably would not have ordered at all when i received the product it did not lock correctly then i realized that the bottom the blender was damaged so it would not lock so i purchased a blender that's not functioning i am convinced that the majority of the star reviews on this product are manufactured this blender does not blend very well as others have mentioned it leaves chunks of fruit and vegetable no matter how many times you blend it extremely disappointed i put cubes of ice frozen banana with some almond milk to make banana smoothies and the bottom cracked after maybe uses i thought ninjas were supposed to be really good quality extremely unhappy and frustrated with this device absolutely the worst blender i have ever purchased i used it all of three times and the light wouldn't stop flashing even though i had it aligned properly i called customer service and they were absolutely useless turns out that even though the blender says dish washer safe you can only put it on the top shelf which doesn't make sense because it's too big to fit on any standard dishwashers top shelf apparently a piece on the jug melted off in the dishwasher needless to say i am never buying one of their products again i'm writing this review as i purchase my third ninja blender for the money it does a great job blends ice easily as well as frozen fruit smoothies are super smooth however these don't last very long i've gone through three in about six years they work better than a regular blender but the motor seems to slow down and eventually stop but i'd rather replace altogether than spend the big bucks on a vitamix or blendtec so i'd say the ninja is of decent value if you're looking for a good blender for frequent use burnt out after rd use so frustrating after only uses the blender completely stopped working right in the middle of cooking i was completely stuck with half blended food and no alternatives i like the power of this blender it does cut through the frozen fruit i use to make smoothies my biggest complaint is the square jar food gets stuck in the corners all the time and then i have to stop it scrape it out of the corners and blend again then repeat until all the food has been properly mashed i would like a round jar so the food doesn't get stuck in the corners also the plastic pour spout lid in the big lid did not last long before it had broken off i'm giving this blender a because it works well if it's not broken within months mine had cracks in the plastic container so whenever i made smoothies almond milk basically anything remotely liquid it would mean out all over the place my husband bought it for me on amazon and unfortunately neither amazon or ninja will replace it or even respond to him about it for that matter a pretty big disappointment when you spend this much on something i would not buy ninja again it just doesnt last terrible product it just stopped working and i've have it less than a year it lights up but will not start very frustrating waste of money just purchased in april and it started leaking it's a decent blender it blends really well and fast it blends things smoothly cons are that it is a pretty large blender also sometimes it smells like the motor is burning lastly if you want to make smoothies buy the blender that has the single serve option this model doesn't i thought i was getting a nice new ninja and of course i'm schooled by buying a old model nothing like what you think you're getting nice work a 's i was excited to get my blender but after months of periodic use it just died for no reason what a bummer i miss my vitamix don't purchase if expecting to make smooth milkshakes just doesn't do the trick i hate this blender i'm so confused of all the high ratings my mom bought me this for my birthday to replace my small watt one so i could make smoothies for me the kids in one shot well nobody will drink my green smoothies including me no matter what i do there are still pieces of spinach in my smoothies or whole chocolate chips the blades are much too far apart to really finely chop anything i also feel like the protein powder doesn't get incorporated as well it's just not good at making smooth drinks i miss my old watt however it does well when using it for blender muffins or other baked goods where everything doesn't have to be completely smooth so i'll give it two stars for that but i have a food processor so that's not what i wanted this for very disappointing i started with the ninja coffee machine and did its job so i decided to also order the coffee grinder and blender to make bulletproof coffee the blender cracked after only a few weeks and i can tell you that this machine was handled with care like several other reviewers mine developed stress fractures on the bottom of the pitcher within three months of use the pitcher now leaks based on other reviews describing the same problem there seems to be a manufactures defect that causes this issue buyer beware my pitcher cracked after one month of use stars actually pros powerful big enough to make good size smoothies for up to people cons takes up space noisy doesn't puree very finely takes time to clean especially when nut butter is used and it's gets stuck to the sides tips use brush to clean the blades easily without having to touch the blades i have had this about months i have not used it all that much it was alright while it worked but it didn't really match up to the hype this morning i set it up plugged it in and turned on the power nothing i am used to this happening at around a year and a few months with my coffee pot but then i use it multipe times every day i was not expecting this from my blender that has not been used every day maybe times a month so i can't really recommend this to anyone not really happy to have basically thrown away the cost of this blender i have mixed feelings about this blender my main problem with it is that it makes smoothies that aren't actually smooth they have little bits and pieces left in the smoothie no matter what kind of fruit or vegetable i use i used an oster blender before getting this one and the oster one would make awesomely smooth blends without a problem i even made flours with it i'd put a grain of choice like oats or even beans and make flours to make my own sourdough gluten free bread this blender would not make smooth flours it'd only chop the grains up and leave large particles in it same with veggies and fruit when i make a smoothie i'm making a smoothie and i'm expecting it to be perfectly liquefied the resulting grainy texture is not to my liking at all and no matter how long i blend for i still can't achieve the perfectly smooth texture like my cheap oster did so well i don't know what to do with it now it's a recent gift and a generous one now i may be missing something here and maybe i'm doing something wrong but i'm putting veggies fruits in pour some liquid in turn the power on and then blend on high for a couple minutes i never fill up the blender because i only make shakes for myself so when i blend my smoothies they are always about one two cups in size no more so maybe that's the problem but i can't make more because i simply can't drink that much in one setting i would appreciate if anyone could help me figure this out because i don't want to get rid of it just yet everything is amazing except it cracked with in a week in we are pretty certain we didn't drop it but did blend hot liquids might try again if i can figure out how to return it does not blend leaves can see and feel the particles no amount of time changes that not good for smoothies i returned and got a nuttribullet it works much better do i got a story for you so one day i was singing right and i thot i sounded like a cat in a blender so i wanted to see if it was true but the cat didnt fit it did not access me needs im very upset if i could put less than one star i would i have had the ninja professional blender for months i used it a total of times for making smoothies it just quit working for no aparent reason i strongly recommend not buying this item dangerous product do not buy for any reason dangerous and wasteful as blades must be removed for cleaning watch out they're sharp and smoothie sticks to plastic and must be leaned with spatula to get decent amount sorry i purchased this i'll try another glass waring blender with blades intact blender worked great until cheap plastic pitcher developed a significant crack along the bottom only about two weeks in leaked everywhere replacement jar arrived with same crack in same location not interested in going for was excited to use it but it did work did not turn on sending it back a below average blender it does not blend anything into a smoothie consistency all it does is that it chops veggies and greens really small but still not a smoothie i bought mine from jc penny and is right now shelfed and is never used it doesn't grind up my spinach or berries the consistency of my smoothies is very thick no matter how much liquid i add with pieces of the spinach and kale and blueberries in each and every sip the only problem i found with this blender is that i can't take the bottom out so i can wash it properly i've had my ninja for about months i loved it used primarily for smoothies with frozen fruit the other day it exploded on me and tore a hole through it i have contacted ninja they didn't seem too concerned about it and when i pressed them and offered to send them the defective blender jar so they could figure out the defect they didn't seem very interested the email they gave me was incorrect so i have to call them again to try and pursue this i don't want another one i just want them check it out because obviously there is an issue i think they are discontinuing this model the cups that amazon said would go with it do not fit i'm sending the whole deal back it might work fine but i want the convenience of the cups the blades are stacked and don't fit the cups worked well the first few times i used it then just completely broke less than months after purchase the lid has a serious flaw in that it allows water to get inside of it every time you pull it out of the dishwasher the inside of the lid is full of water and won't come out easily it's a breeding ground for bacteria blades packaged dangerously and lacerated thumb down to tendon do not purchase this it stopped working after month of use i like a thick smoothie which my old blender made just fine until i broke it years later i decided to splurge and buy this blender huge mistake the first day of use i had to scrape the sides of the blender to get all the fruit mixed in then when i drank it there were still huge clumps of fruit in it so the next day i tried to scrape the sides mix with a spoon and blend for a longer period and i still had clumps in my smoothie or should i say clumpy save your money and buy a much less expensive blender that actually works the very first day i got this i tried to make one of the drinks in the included recipe book the drink recipe included frozen fruits and ice something bent immediately and now the blender rumbles heavily even when empty i think the problem is the design of the of the long blade shaft with three spaced sets of blades i believe it allows too much torque on the shaft and leads to failure i went back to my leaky thirty dollar blender and made the same drink without issue i hate to do it but i'm returning this and buying a vitamix when i go to town tomorrow don't be this guy please do not buy this blender i had it for days before i had to return it holy crap this thing is the pinnacle of cheap shoddy phony knock off garbage the blades are the stupidest design ive ever seen a plastic black rod in the center with several completely flat blades this thing cannot pulverize kale please get yourself an oster or a cuisinart you will not be disappointed oster in particular makes incredible blenders do not support this crappy company i purchased the ninja last week when i remembered i didn't have a blender at our vacation home i needed something in a hurry and didn't have time to shop i am using it for my green smoothies spinach kale water and some frozen fruit i put the spinach kale and water in the ninja then liquify before adding the frozen fruit ending up with a grainy drink with a shake like thickness i can temporarily live with the graininess though this may be a problem for some the blender container is large enough that i can make a double serving with no problem the blade is scary but i handle it with the utmost care and so far there have been no mishaps the lid container and blade are extremely lightweight plastic and do not seem sturdy they are dishwasher safe making clean up quick and easy but i've noticed the hollow handle retains internal moisture that does not dry in the course of the day might lead to bacterial growth overall this does not come anywhere close to the high end blender i have at home i don't expect this blender to last very long it arrived within hours through amazon prime was safely packaged and as described i feel i received what i would expect at this price point but have already decided to purchase a nicer blender before our next visit we liked it but it broke after months and this is certainly no exception this is simply a failure of a blender the designers took something that essentially worked the standard blender and messed with it to the point where the standard blender's deficiencies are magnified a standard blender only has blades at the bottom which are bent to form a cyclonic action which draws the food to the bottom of the carafe it has but one problem if there is too much food in the carafe and it's not very fluid like fruit or nuts then it won't adequately draw the food at the top of the blender down into the blades it'll puree what's at the bottom and then you're stuck forcing the top parts down into the blades with a wooden spoon i think whoever designed the ninja must have been trying to solve this but they failed spectacularly the horizontal blades are clearly designed to increase the volume of food that is blended but since they're perfectly horizontal there's no cyclone action this means you end up with layers of blended food alternating with layers of solid chunks so the problem of the traditional blender is multiplied in this one but wait there's more since the blades go most of the way up the blender they had to add a bunch of safety wank to it to make sure it won't run unless it's tightly closed and locked so the only way to try to get it to blend properly is to shut it off disengage the safety wank completely remove the lid and poke something down into the now not spinning blades to try to mix the food which doesn't work because the blades alternate degrees and you can't really poke anything to the bottom so you end up leaving it locked removing it from the base and trying to shake up the contents well if i'm removing the carafe and shaking things up to try to get them to blend i'd say that's a failed product i'm not one bit sure how people make smoothies out of this thing without going crazy from frustration add in the fact that the safety wank broke within six months and i now have to hold the lid down to get the safety to engage and it's got a way ticket to one starsville i didn't even care enough about this thing to leave a review but amazon shoved it in my face when i started looking for its replacement container cracked in less than months this is a wearable item not covered by the year warranty broke in less than a week won't power on with smoothies didn't chop fruit and veggies as fine as expected compared to a oyster blender i've used junk blender it makes chunkies not smoothies it cannot blend red chile for nothing my year old oster outperforms it i am surprised no one has mentioned how hard the lid and blades are to clean so many nooks and crannies i have to use a toothbrush not worth the hassle sometimes also leaves big chucks of frozen fruit in my smoothie even if i only fill it hald way too bad i can't give this zero stars what a total piece of junk i also have a vitamix at my second home and it kicks the pants off of this ninja vitamix absolutely pur es anything i can put into it oatmeal flaxseed everything the ninja never makes everything perfectly smooth there are still chunks it's difficult to clean because there are six small blades my smoothie gets into the blade tower assembly and is difficult to clean out the lid is mechanized with a spring release handle and i am just waiting for it to break less expensive isn't always a better deal if the product doesn't work in my book inexpensive things are a total waste of money invest in a vitamix and you will be well served for many years i bet you could put this ninja into a vitamix and it would pur e it to my mom had got one of these blenders and it had gotten four symmetrical cracks in all four bottom of the plastic container causing it to leak thinking we stored it wrong causing the cracks we bought another not more than the two weeks we had the new one simply crushing ice had put the same identical four cracks in the new blender i'm disappointed because because we cant seem to ave the option to return either blenders which are now useless its a shame because the blenders worked great other than the cracking feature file c users jacob downloads img jpg was really looking forward to getting this blender as i heard so many people rave about their ninja blenders and i wanted a nice one to make fruit smoothies with on a regular basis i was pretty disappointed with this one pros blades easily remove to make pouring and cleaning easy nice pour spout on lid don't have to remove lid to pour chops ice well cons because the blades are in the middle i find that some food items i put in just get pushed out to the sides and stick there instead of getting blended in no matter how long i let it blend i have to open up and scrape the food off the sides to ensure that it all gets mixed together and there are no chunks even when i add more liquid in the mixture this continues to be an issue does not chop up things like pomegranate seeds included in one of the frozen berry mixes i buy from costco no matter how long i blend it i end up chewing on whole seeds every time so i have started buying a different berry mixture so i don't have to worry about seeds but i shouldn't have to do that i wish i could return this and use the money towards a higher quality blender absolutely horrible if i could give this product a zero i would i used to make smoothies every single morning in my cheapie osterizer blender and now i've maybe had in the last month because using this thing is so frustrating i can't get the food in because the blades are in the way once i finally get everything in and start it it all shoots up in the air and sticks everywhere then you have to release the lid use something to scrape the sides and repeat this multiple times then after all that work you're left with a chunky textured mixture rather than a nice smooth smoothie it terrible something that used to take me minutes now takes me and i can't even enjoy the finished product i'm just past my return window with amazon and ninja won't stand behind their product i wasted my but hopefully if you read this i can save you the money i can't use the product because the lid was missing from the box and i'm not sure who to contact or how to get it replaced i'm sure i will love it if i can get the lid very bad ninja does not blend well needed a blender to accommodate my family of three since my nutribullet wasn't big enough however i find myself reblending the smoothies in my nutribullet if your are wanting chunky and grainy smoothies this product is for you we ordered this and when it came in it did not work we had to return the item when i compare this product to my costco oster blender i would have to say it is so much better but it's not perfect and we still have an issue with having to go in there and move things around the extra blades do help but sometimes it doesn't blend completely and we have to go in there with a spoon and move things around to get it to blend consistently an extra blade right in the middle would've actually prevented that technically i give this stars not because of the blending issue bought on october one of the clip that locks the lid on broke off after minimal usage the broken clip prevents the blender lid from locking and deactivating the safety rendering the blender useless their warranty states that i will have to pay to cover the cost of returning a replacement factor in the cost to ship the broken blender to them that would be of the original purchase price i would not recommend this blender stick with glass container versus plastic it's been month since my purchase it's not what i expected it that is to give me a fine smoothie no matter how long i let it run works great i purchased my ninja at the end of dec or early jan unfortunately there at many cracks and leaks i've followed directions for how to clean and take care of the product my expectations were high but sadly it's almost of no use due to leaking i really regret this purchase i barely used the blender and already it's leaking out of the top ridiculous for a blender of this price to last months okay blender i think a bit overpriced it seems to be very durable so far plastic and blades i have to blend for a while on high to completely blend a smoothie not very quick very disappointed months old and suddenly stop working i thought for the price it would last years before replacing it don't buy it don't waste your money go to walmart or target buy one the price it will last years like the one i owned before if you forget to turn off you have to unplug for minutes and try again i have used it for a couple of months and it doesn't work anymore wish it was glass scratches way too easy well after having this blender for a very short period of time it began to show stress cracks on the bottom of the pitcher just as a number of other reviewers have described i'm not sure why it has such a favorable rating other than maybe name recognition but we have returned it and have chosen another brand that will hopefully be more reliable will not work any more i am terribly disappointed in this blender i had originally wanted a vitamix but did not want to shell out so much money for something i intend to use solely for smoothies i should have just saved up and bought the vitamix like i intended to this blender gets the job somewhat done but i have pieces of spinach and kale in my breakfast smoothie i could have just bought a blender from my local walmart if i wanted that also the blade is removable which i like but while washing it in a rush i mistakenly nicked myself i am so use to the blades being at the bottom of the devise this was my fault i know but i just wanted to make sure you are aware it also makes it a little more difficult for the ingredients to go throughout the blender in my opinion after my last blender died everyone recommended a ninja i just made my first shake and it unfortunately doesn't grind up blend chia or flax seeds the spinach and ice were blended fine and it looks to be sturdy and built well if you're not going to be adding any seeds or small items like that i imagine you'll be fine but i believe the tower blades don't catch them the same way a traditionally structured blender does i purchased this product months ago but just opened last week to use it it does a very poor job of blending stuff i find chunks of items after blending for a long time i tried several times with different items and got a poor performance every time do not buy you will be disappointed worked well for a couple of years and now the motor is smoking used mostly for making smoothies now it smells like an electrical fire cheap plastic piece on the lid broke off mold growing in handle mold growing in black pieces in bottom and doesn't blend smoothly my ninja lasted just a few years it never blended smoothly fine chunks were always left the flimsily designed safety mechanism that prevents blending unless the top is shut tight failed and it would have required a replacement beaker the gaskets on the blender lid partially melted in my new dishwasher top shelf with no heated dry cycle i've replaced the ninja with a blender and i'm happier there were cracks marks in the blender itself upon receiving plus i am not sure what ice some others are using but this made slushies tested all options rather than smoothies did not job ice this blender has a wand with three blades spaced a couple of inches apart instead of the single multi bladed piece that is in the bottom of my old blender when i tried to make a fruit smoothie some of the fruit did not get pureed and was stuck under the first blade had to return it i don't know if i bought a defunct one but the first time i used this the blender part broke bout the same style from costco and it worked fine it stop working when used to grind chunks of solid material into a powder there is a large dead zone at the bottom of the blender blade assembly is difficult to clean when just blending with water doesn't do the job the unit stopped working after to dozen times uses that were admittedly far more demanding than most applications although much less than grinding a wood or fiberglass handle also the plastic container was extensively scratched and pitted will not buy again for this application i used this for months and when it started it was great it blended everything perfectly no issues however now it is really struggling to blend things to the point of being able to drink them in a smoothie the kale is chunky and the smoothies are hard to drink i certainly expected this to last longer than a couple months gear shaft is plastic breaks easily i'm giving this product stars for only reason it has a lot of power yes as other reviews say it can handle ice with no issue i normally would give it star because in terms of making a smoothie for my liking is very disappointing i am the type of smoothie drinker that doesn't do well with chunks or pulpy textures i would rather have a smooth creamy blend this machine i wouldn't call a blender because of where the blades are positioned this machine is more like a food processor than a blender even that's pushing it as my food processor can make a more smooth texture than this if you are a person who doesn't mind chunks pulp then yes this is a good machine i'm sure making your soup in here would also be good as it could chop everything up then just pour it in a pot but don't quote me on that as i have not made soup with it in terms of a nice smoothie blend than definitely not including green smoothie drinks like kale or spinach i am also not happy with how the lid works it has to go in just right or the machine wont turn on at all if the blade attachment is even slightly off center you have to unlock the darn thing try to get it lined up which can be a little annoying if you have loads of food in it as it will push the blade to one side the lid only goes on one way to safely lock a good safety feature i suppose but a bit annoying is all the blades are a little intimidating to wash very sharp toothbrush gets the job done without getting your fingers sliced off so i bought the blender a few months ago and finally took it out of the box today to use it i am a huge fan of ninja blenders but this one just stopped working after we used it three times i hope i can get a replacement this lasted about a month before the pitcher cracked on the bottom and started leaking also one of the black plastic feet on the pitcher broke off this blender is ridiculously awful we bought this on february and it is now april and the thing just stopped working waste of money i've been using this blender for months and worked great super powerful blender with nice design but the plastic jar since to be made of a poor quality plastic because it cracked while blending i use the blender around to times a week i only blend fruits and i don't even use ice i've been trying to contact the seller but not answer phone just keep ringing i'm very disappointed for what it could have been a great machine too large works about as well as a blender with more blades stuff still gets stuck to the sides prompting shaking prodding with a spoon not ideal but it gets the job done stopped working after months it's a lot of money for a product that won't last i own a vitamix so my experience with this is relative to that stars cons the design the blade is very very dangerous it is not locked into the container at all so it can pop out if you are pouring also the stacked blades make it difficult to load chunks of apples carrots etc you have to cut into small pieces to get around the blade the base gear is plastic unlike the vitamix which is metal i worry about the durability motor this blender is watts but is in no way comparable to my vitamix which is watts it appears to spin much slower and doesn't completely blend items such as kale apples still has slight chunks i realize not a juicer but my vitamix totally liquefies everything pros the price is very affordable the price i paid for my vitamix i love the container lid because it has a small opening for pouring power settings low high and has a pulse overall i highly recommend to pass on this blender and save up the money and buy a much better quality blender such as a vitamix i bought this blender as i thought this would be a solid blender to make my smoothies boy was i wrong i am an avid juicer and normally also love smoothies when i bought this blender i was not trying to chop up onions or anything hard and crazy just making a shake and something easy to clean however after washes in the dishwasher i saw a crack and on top of the crack i also saw this blender leak all over my counter its disgusting and time consuming to clean the actual blender for all the droplets of my smoothie and it just makes a huge mess if you want a solid blender this is not the one guys look for a glass blender don't waste your money i saw so many ads on tv and five star ratings that i thought this would be a great blender not the speed is so high even at the lowest setting it throws everything up to the top of the carafe and doesn't get that part blended and even on the high speed it doesn't thoroughly blend the ice so you can forget about having that smoothie experience so i'll be junking this and buying a kitchen aid blender it was not what i was expected at all it does not blend anything not even spanich and it takes forever to simply crush things such a disappointment i don't know what the problem is with this blender i really thought this blender would've been the best and last blender i would ever have to buy but unfortunately not im returning it and go buy a much better brand ninja's just suck in general i hate anything ninja we only use this because vitamix's are dollars minimum not the quality i expected does not crush ice as well as expected it's ok but not great this machine worked well for weeks after that the machine broke luckily it was replaced by ninja let see what happens with the new one this replaced my oster blender which did an excellent job of blending my smoothies until it all but died i mix steel cut oats in my smoothies my oster did an excellent job of emulsifying the oats whereas this ninja left too much grit i mix the oats with water for minutes on high and still grit i also prefer a more dense smoothie this ninja returned a looser smoothie yet somehow still left a lot of chewy bits not a bad thing just an observation comparison item returned and replaced with a new high powered oster i blend times a week this is a powerful fast and easy to clean blender however it is plastic and the pitcher got cracks along the base with repeated use i imagine it wouldn't have cracked if i didn't fill it with ice so much the replacement pitcher is which is crazy very loud and doesn't have the setting that i thought so makes everything into mush if you're interested in making green smoothies like i am you might want to look elsewhere even on the highest setting my smoothie kale banana apple and milk is chunky and chewy see picture seeing a video review comparing this blender to the kitchenaid speed diamond blender has convinced me that if i want to put the smooth in smoothie i need to get the latter which is ostensibly quieter and blends veggies very well will be returning this one tomorrow months of twice a week usage and the container is leaking a bit i've had a vitamix before and although this ninja mixes well it takes a while just to get to a decent consistency i realize i'm comparing to i think i'd rather have a nutribullet or travel mug style blender over this one at this point i've had nutribullets and they're much better for single serving smoothies the pros it's really powerful and can handle anything you put in there the cons it's so loud i can't even use this in the mornings to make a smoothie for fear of waking up my neighbors in the apartments above below and next to me the cats scatter in fear every time i use the blender it really is shockingly loud i ended up buying something much smaller and a lot quieter one year later and it making an awful grinding noise in the motor good for the price takes too long to blend and the consistency of smoothies are uneven i'm on my rd ninja the first worked for a few times then the power light starts flashing red and stops working the rd didn't even work right out of the box these things are junk had it for less than a month and the plastic cracked spilling the contents all over the counter broke in months i was very disappointed that even with blades this blender doesn't do as well as the kitchenaid blender i had the smoothies are gritty and not smooth i blend every other day and my smoothies are critical to my happiness so i'm pretty stressed out that i have to drink gritty smoothies this week until i get my hands on something that works better during blending i can see there are areas where large particles are not circulating to the blades and are staying unblended at up to a mm size on a positive note the blender is sexy and feels pro the capacity is a big plus as i like to drink a couple of quarts of smoothie over the course of two days i only wish that it did what it's supposed to do better i purchased the ninja blender as a present for my wife the blender itself is terrific however the design is not optimal in order for the blender to function the pitcher must be inserted and locked into position in the base and the lid must be locked i think these safety measures are a good idea and agree with the concept however when the lid is locked a small plastic tab protrudes into the blender base in order for the blender to operate this plastic tab broke after uses you can t replace the plastic tab you have to replace the entire pitcher which costs i am waiting to see if the vendor will replace the pitcher and will update my rating upon their response for now i am giving this stars update company did replace pitcher increasing rating to stars as i still am unimpressed with design this blender is horrible it cracked after uses when i poured hot water in it very disappointing the blade assembly restricts the loading capability motor dead after used for a few times the blender jar cracked and leaks after just and half months of light use it was not dropped or slammed just cracked by the spinning part at the bottom very dissapointed i had to return this item after several attempts to try and get it to function and getting hung up on by ninja costumer representative it was not worth my money or aggravation as for me it will be a long time if ever before i purchase another ninja product received this as a gift was very excited blender is a powerhouse but not for hot liquids like coffee anyone on a keto plan and or who makes bullet proof coffee this is not the bulletproof blender for you after just a few uses with hot coffee the base of the blender has several cracks which now leak the instructions state to not use for hot liquids but of course i read that after i got it open it was a gift i gave it a try it failed and i'm dismayed i really really liked it otherwise it has been standing up to daily dishwasher washings this blender is more like a chopper nothing like a vitamix or even just a regular blender it doesn't make a smoothie smooth still have to chew it in a way it is powerful so maybe good as a food processor instead while i love that i can make two or three smoothies at a time it doesn't blend that well sometimes whole leaves of spinach will go unblended regardless of how long i blend or at what speed i thought it would be better for the price decent blender the blades at different heights are not an advantage a pain to clean and an accident waiting to happen not the best at blending things into a smooth liquid the spinich i add to my protein smoothies still have small pieces of green after blending for seconds so blending capability is average this company needs to learn to be customer friendly i dropped the pitcher a few months ago the price at which they sell a replacement pitcher is almost the same within as the cost of a new blender so i reluctantly bought a new one i should have shopped more for this reason alone after the useful life of this blender just on principle i will not buy another ninja blender i made a mistake and now need help because in pakistan we have v and even though i later ordered a cheap v to v converter but it didn't work any one has any recommendation didn't work out for my kitchen too big nothing wrong with the blender i bought it mostly to crush the ice in the smoothies but it does not crush the ice well no longer using it this is a well made product and would be a good choice if you blend large quantities of liquids however it is not a good choice for mixing my morning protein drink the blender pitcher is very large and there is a center stem with numerous blades when i pour in my oz of milk some splashes on the blades then when i add the protein powder some of it sticks to the wet blades mixing does not completely dissolve the powder on the blades in addition when i turn on the blender some of the protein powder is thrown up against the sides of the pitcher i have to use a knife to scrape the powder off the sides i tried putting in the powder first and then adding the milk that just made the powder stick to the bottom of the pitcher and it was not dislodged by the blending action i think i need a smaller pitcher less blades and more variable speed control for blending i chose this blender based on the good reviews here on amazon to replace my year old kitchen aid classic i was excited to see if this baby worked as well as everyone says well i am sorely disappointed i use my blender mostly for making fruit and veggie smoothies the ninja handles greens very poorly i can still see bits and chunks of baby spinach throughout my smoothie forget about blending other sturdier greens i had to pretty much chew my smoothie when i added chopped up beet root leaves i find i have to stop the blender several times to scrape the sides as it throws chunks of fruit up the sides of the pitcher and they never get pulled back in to blend i never had this problem with my kitchen aid my old kitchen aid performed far superior to the the ninja greens were perfectly blended in without a trace i am returning the ninja and ordered a new kitchen aid instead after first washing lit didn't go in the right place fast shipping bad product if i could leave zero stars i would we purchased this to make bullet proof coffee and that is all it was used for in the six weeks we had it in our possession we used it twice daily for weeks to blend coffee with butter and mct oil we blended for a maximum of seconds each time we used it we never used ice in the machine while we owned it after only six weeks it began leaking at the base where the blade attaches there was no way for us to tighten anything for the amount of money we paid for it this was a huge disappointment professional yeah right this is not a professional blender pros it blended our contents quickly and efficiently albeit it was only coffee and butter other cons the carafe is plastic not glass i knew this when i ordered it but i just cannot understand what's so hard about making a blender that is made with glass and metal i owned an oster for years and it was awesome until the blade started to leak and when we replaced it the oem part cracked within months they just don't make appliances like they use to years ago also this blender is huuuuuuge it wouldn't even fit under my cabinets so i had to leave the carafe off and sit it to the side taking up twice as much of my counter top space also it's very loud but most blenders are we never had any issues with the blade flying out at us like one review we read you just have to be careful when pouring which is where the spot comes in handy or remove the blade to pour your contents would i purchase it again or recommend this product absolutely not i had the option to exchange it but if an appliance can show that kind of poor design after only weeks i don't want anything to do with it we went back to an oster with a glass carafe and so far it's working great i received this a few weeks back i only started using it a few days ago it stopped working mid smoothie th time and it stopped not sure if it's defected i want to know if i can return it without the original box i can't justify paying for this and not getting a refund packing was great but this particular machine was too big for me and my space i make smaller smoothies for breakfast and this machine is built for larger capacity it doesn't even compare to a vitamix save the money and get a vitamix took forever to chop the ice in our drinks and was sooo loud bought this in worked fine until a few months ago first the power switch would act up but if i pressed in different places it is a wide rectangle and with different levels of pressure i could get it to work then it got to the point where it was impossible to turn on so after two years it is useless i called the company and they told me that i could buy a new base which costs about the same as other blenders waste of time and money steer clear away from this junk i've had blenders last for much longer and have only stopped using them because i broke the jug and you can't get a replacement little pieces break off of this all the time and it turns on when it wants to half the time the power button just blinks when you turn it on so you have to walk away from your smoothie ingredients and hope your blender is in a better mood later it reminds me of some over the top action figure from the s you know they added a bunch of new parts and mechanical features but they just made the thing cheaper and there was nothing wrong with the original this design is stupid the square shaped pitcher leaves chunks in the corners when one tries to use herbs or heavy massed ingredients relatively such as cucumber mint basil ginger etc with such high reviews we were excited about this purchase and although it was great when it worked after probably less than uses it died when pressing the power button it turns red and flashes and will no longer operate although affordable initially don't waste your money because it won't last ordered this gift wrapped as a christmas present quite surprising when my wife opened the wrapping and saw only the blender base no commercial box just cardboard wrapped around the base merry christmas to us the base was cracked and chipped off everything was fine but the shipping label was just placed right on the box without any further protection easily could've been broken don't fall for the hype within year of purchase heats up and too much noise contacted customer service got only lip service worst blender i ever bought figured with watts it will do better than the faberware with watts but the faberware does a way better job than this blender claims of blending to a smooth consistency are false really disappointed with this product and all the fake advertisements they have also the motor stopped working same day as i purchase it is ok nothing special i've have this blender for a year and i'm not a fan at all i'm tired of chewing my smoothies the first we received did not work at all the second one has worked for less than months something has happened with the safety mechanisms and it won't turn on if you hold down the safety buttons on the base it will fire up but when you put the container on it the safety buttons aren't being pushed apparently my return window has expired so i am stuck with a worthless paperweight i've used this blender almost daily for a year now and the final verdict is in this blender sucks those once sharp blades quickly turned into spinning butte knives after washing it in a dishwasher a couple of time gunk accumulates in the handle which you can see through the clear side nasty anything remotely challenging greens peels etc won't come out even close to smooth no matter how long you leave the machine running prior to this machine i had used an oster beehive which are pretty cheap overall that was a better blender than this i was always dubious about a company that called itself ninja turns out i was right initially it was a great product but after a few months it fell apart ball bearings metal shavings etc it's expensive and does not last very long i've owned the shark ninja bl for a couple of years and have loved it wanting something bigger for larger quantities i purchased this it does the trick though i feel my lil shark did it better my biggest complaint is that it is a bit of a pain to clean careful with washing the blades and don't miss all the crevices on the lid i suspect this will end up in the same status as my food processor gathering dust for the same reason broken on arrival it only work for a few days do not know what happened used a few times and not at all impressed one of those things that looks cool on tv but shoulda moved on they sent me an old one i paid full price for new one it doesn't work well with small amount of friuts or vegetables but it has sharp blades stars for blades haven't had a chance to use it yet but the box was pierced and it made a huge scratch in the base of he blender bummer for a brand new scratched blender give up and one year product not good very powerful but stopped working unexpectedly rarely used has a pale red light and will not power on very disappointed because i really loved the product is there any suggestions to what might be the problem i saw others with the same issue it's a waste of money don't buy until the life's span issue is sorted out the blender worked great however already burned out after only a couple of months using it overall very disappointed in the longevity of the product we've had to replace the pitcher times because it keeps cracking near the blade we don't put it in the dishwasher anymore and are very delicate with it keeps happening and it keeps taking over months for it to arrive great blender for its cost and great for pulverizing hard to shred blend vegetables like kale it beats having spent the money buying a vitamix our only gripe is that after only a couple of months use one of the clips in the cover snapped which has now rendered the cover useless the machine will only work properly if it can sense that all clips are in securely we looked into a replacement recover but it costs just as much as a new machine the whole thing has now been sitting on our shelf for about months don't know if we'll ever buy a replacement cover i bought this blender to make smoothies they didn't come out very well at all no matter how much liquid i added to the fruit mix strawberries blueberries blackberries bananas etc or how long it blended the mixture came out lumpy and hardly able to pass through the straw of my travel glass since i have a food processor that gives the same results i don't need another i ordered it as a new item as a wedding shower gift when i wrapped it the box was visibly previously opened not liking that even a little bit no feedback from bride be yet but i will ask if anymore evidence that it was not new previously opened box weird blade placement makes this blender a little too difficult to handle safely i returned it for much simpler blender with a round glass carafe just okay hard to get the proper texture smoothie either chunks of ice or too runny wish i had my old blender back i loved this blender but unfortunately after only a few months of about days a week once a day use the pitcher bottom cracked no idea how it wasn't ever dropped or smacked against anything i purchased this in april and discovered the crack today august th when i went to wash it after the last use and found it leaking searching the reviews i find i'm not the only one with this problem and also the replacement part is expensive the bl costs the pitcher replacement part only comes with the lid which i don't need is not bad for price however does not blend some smoothies i e kale as well as i had hoped seems to have very strong motor and chews through ice no problem the problem i had was the lid broke so i'm being forced to buy a new one since the stock for lid replacements is on back order indefinitely according to customer service i can't really recommend a product if it becomes a paperweight after about uses so i'll swallow my pride and order a new lid from the web site which is a lot cheaper than other places for the oem lid i think overall it is okay but beware of customer service as much as i wanted to like this blender it is difficult for me to use i lined up the arrows on the lid as directed but the lid doesn't always align with the top of the blade staff because of this it doesn't begin to blend until it is locked into the lid therefore i regret that i have to send it back it takes way to much time to make a smooth blend one apple one banana one cup of oats and milk very fancy poor performance it doesn't chop greens well not reliable at all we've only had our ninja a few months used it a few times and yet i went to use it today and nothing what a waste of bucks this thing is waaaaay more glorified than it should be settings and it does a terrible job of fully blending anything with seeds strawberries kiwi even had a hard time blending broccoli most of the things we blended need to be strained afterwards guess we wasted our money buying a magic bullet next time or even just a basic blender from our local grocery those seem to work x's better this blender is horrible for green smoothies the greens never get fully pulverized i've tried everything even steaming them first i don't know if it's the motor or the blades but it can only produce chunky smoothies the blender blade popped out without warning while i was pouring smoothie and landed on my foot stitches later and now i am too traumatized to use it again gave it stars though because the smoothie was still good i hate it when people write a review after having had a product for a week you can't really know how well a product works until you have lived with it for a bit i have had my ninja blender for a couple months now and here is what i think it's made out of plastic so it doesn't feel as sturdy as i would like it's powerful you could mix concert in it if you had too so no complaints there however it is impossible to get clean the blades are razor sharp good but it makes for slow and careful cleaning the lid is full of cracks and ridges that just seem to collect and hold gunk no mater what i use this thing multiple times a week and dread cleaning it every time i don't know why they don't design appliances with cleaning in mind i've own the blender for only five days however there is already condensation in the plastic handle and there is no way to clear it away i'm currently on hold with the ninja company they said they will replace the handle but it will take weeks as it's not in stock hopefully condensation will not form in the replacement as far as the efficiency of the blender it's powerful and pretty noisy i sometimes find chunks of frozen banana in my blended shake which is surprising given the three levels of blades i guess i will need to blend it longer i like the look of the blender but it's taller than a typical blender it doesn't fit easily beneath my cabinets measure before you order while this is the best blender i have ever had it is also extremely dangerous imho the blades are indeed effective at chopping through everything however they are sharp very very very sharp i wasn't paying attention after a few margaritas and wow i got a cm cut on my thumb that went pretty deep i was considering stitches it happened days ago blood everywhere ran for my first aid kit and covered the wound with gauze and tape have had it covered in antibiotic ointment and now down to a band aid but it is still open have to wear a glove to do the dishes i strongly advise if you have children you pack this high on a shelf and use extreme caution i didn't test the sharpness of the blades but imho the sharpness felt razor sharp so did the side by side comparo with newly amazon purchased vitamix g series based on glowing reviews that ninja was comparable at the cost bottom line there is no comparison you will chew your green smoothies etc see other star reviews for details if you want high performance blending in your life save your money mortgage your house do whatever it takes to get a vitamix into your life also the three level blade system is dangerous see previous reviews about this too so disappointed i am all geared up to start having smoothies to lose weight and eat healthier used it one time and now the motor doesn't work contacted shark ninja and they are sending me a replacement motor which will take business days to receive there should be some type of quality control to make sure motors work before customers purchase them sadly broke after days of light use i've always heard how great the ninja was it's good but doesn't compete with my other blender this was a gift i gave to friends and when they moved they gave it back as they couldn't move everything i have a kitchen aid blender that is a factory refurb that i paid new are the ninja cannot liquefy solids for smoothies and i ran it for several minutes on high any leafy greens remain in small but large chunks if you're wanting to make soups or just fruits this blender will work fine however if you want one that blends leafy greens for smoothies this will disappoint you good blender but cup is easy to brake i really wanted to love this and give it a five star but can't i have usually used this or times a week since i got it a few months ago but i don't feel as though it emulsifies as well as my old bullet i love that clean up is so easy and that i only have to make one batch instead of batch of smoothies for my family but it comes out so much more chunkier also after only a few uses there is now a crack of some sort inside it does not leak but now i have to go thru the hassle of using the warranty i bought thankfully and returning it which i of course have no time for does not liquefy like my old kitchenaid specially seeds in smoothies i think this is due to design flaws centrifugal force keeps pieces on walls and away from blades can't fill properly with the giant blades inside will probably return don't like the cheap plastic jar unless you like to chew your smoothies don't get this blender great blender if you like to chew your smoothies it blasted right through the ice but did nothing with the chia seeds or the blueberry seeds the kale leaf pieces were still visible i'm planning to send it back blades get in the way with veggies started out blending my smoothies really well and smooth but after about a month or so it doesn't blend as well i think i the blades have dulled significantly i wish i would've bought a vitamix or blendtec and it's too late to return now oh and it's very hard to clean did not receive both tops for mugs i bought this thinking it would make juice and it does not i guess i got the wrong ninja blender i bought this to replace my ninja which i was so happy with it served me well for several years i figured that a mere watts wouldn't make that much difference but it does big time it works okay but it is not nearly as powerful as my was i use it every morning for smoothies using all frozen fruit it works but it requires a lot of stopping and stirring and patience lesson learned for my next ninja purchase i bought this blender for smoothies a little over days ago and i found that my smoothies to be quite full of texture you could chew the hemp seeds i bought an ambiano professional blender for the same price and it has the smoothie texture desired i also tried to ask ninja for a refund because i missed the amazon deadline by days and they were unwilling to make any accommodation needless to say i was very disappointed avoid durability is the worst lid assembly was trash after about a month extremely cheap plastic construction of the parts i am not that impressed with this blender perhaps my expectations were too high we have a single serve oyster blender that crushes the ice just a good as this one i feel like the drinks i have made so far mostly fruit smoothies do not have the smooth consistency i am looking for it is however very easy to clean and use i would say this is an average blender at best did not work as well has i expected for a ninja i had heard such great reviews but i didn't find it capable to chop ice in the bottom of the blender this three speed middle finger to sensible product design is a constantly falling apart reminder to never buy a blender that has it's own infomercial ever again the blades total are super sharp and make short work of just about everything except cleaning them it's difficult to get a sponge or washcloth in them without turning your kitchen into a cadaver lab and the post they sit on the blender is tall leaving a deep narrow difficult to clean haven for bacteria the lid of the blender locks secure using a handful of parts enclosed in a hollowed section of the lid that is super duper easy for water to get in but not sponges lending to another safe spot for bacteria to grow and drip into your delicious drink the sealing gasket around the lid is made from this really cool material that hangs out on the blender cup even after you take the lid off i'm not sure what it is but the residue from this rubber has found a permanent home on the blender one of my cutting boards and probably my intestines when the rubber on the lid had just about vanished ninja was happy to send a replacement lid that has been suffering the same gooey fate i just bought it and it is no longer working i need to know what the warranty is should've done more research but this was an impulse buy i got this to replace my little magic bullet as a smoothie maker i only want to make smoothies big mistake this blends things up as a course chop even at the highest speed it's not terrible but by no means a smoothie maker also the blades are not secure in the machine so you have to be very careful when handling other than that i guess it's okay i liked this for about months until it decided it was too old to work anymore it was great while it lasted but that's a lot of money for month's use i loved the capacity for soups but went back to my old model this kind of ninja isn't like the blenders you're used to it's kind of dangerous but it will really grind your food up well here's what you need to know the blades aren't fastened in so you need to remove them before pouring or even moving the blender around much you pull them in and out easily by holding the top of the blade assembly the blades are razor sharp don't get distracted or forget to pay attention while using my daughter asks why would you want an appliance that's trying to kill you well the last blender died after a year because i had to shake the jar to get things at the top to circulate also because this a powerful machine that does the job almost like a vitamix but costs of that in a year i plan to get a vitamix if i still have all my fingers meanwhile this does the job and keeps me on my toes read the directions completely before use there is a common defect with this blender in a short amount of time the blade will often stop engaging with the motor rendering the product useless contacted ninja was promised a replacement this was half a year ago and still no blender they claim to have shipped to me twice now but can not provide tracking numbers or even tell me which carrier was used hmmmmm very disappointed never again if you are getting this to make smoothies don't it chops everything up and sloshes it around it is definitely not smooth when finished i run it longer hoping for it to be smooth but it never is if i had it to do over i would for sure go with the nutri bullett loudest blender i've ever heard sounds like a ship is taking off in the kitchen my boyfriend went to the garage and got his headphones they use to block out sound on runways it claims it's quiet but not as far as a blender it's fine this is a cool product but ultimately very disappointing wouldn't recommend for regular use lots of reasons three blade design looks great but is dull and doesn't chop finely even sharpened myself to try to fix operation depends on a a complex cover design fitting securely but as you'll see the little tabs and springs get out of alignment after multiple uses so you have to press the cover with your hand for continued operation emails calls to customer service were not flat not answered imagine sorry about this review since i thought the design would be better than the old reliables and worth the significant extra cost not so this is a sturdy blender but i would have preferred that the jar be glass not plastic the blades are very sharp unfortunately they sit loose in the blender if you pour something out they fall out works good price with other attachments are cheaper in town seals disintegrated on second use while i love the quality of this blender in general the rubber seals fell apart and we're all through my shakes i wouldn't buy this product again the point the lid is very difficult to open it seems like when you close it it seals it forever so you have to use a lot of physical effort to open it that can be damaging for the plastic container the point it stopped working meaning on the second time i pressed the power button it just stopped turning on the point the cutting blades look very solid and are very sharp and high quality but the way they are designed to be attached inside the blender's container is not secure it has a lot of room for moving on the axi it's attached to so it feels a little lose ended up returning the blender for two main reasons the prep to get the kale and spinach liquified was a pain blending with liquid first then again with all the ingredients became too much of a task and the end result was a chunky juice drink the nd reason for returning was because of the ninja blades i didn't feel safe having my fingers near any of the blades i certainly miss having the large container but i'll make smaller portions with my blendtec unfortunately it's only ok for softer fruits etc doesn't work as well as my regular blender stuff gets stuck on the sides of the blender since its square shape also don't like that it's plastic will return this blender cost and lasted about a year just after the warranty ran out the lid broke and the plastic pour spout broke after about months my oster cost and it lasted years this could be worth it if it cost bucks not impressed this thing is terrible we purchased it as a gift for my parents since they've started to do 'green drinks' each morning the blender they were using was so slow and left the drinks in bite size chunks my wife and i own a vitamix and love it but figured since ninja claims their product competes with vitamix and didn't want to spend we'd give it try clearly you get what you pay for the drinks come out just as chunky as they did with the blender my parents had originally no matter how long the ninja runs no matter how much water or juice we add it simply does not turn fruits and vegis into liquid the really frustrating part is that i called emailed spent over minutes on the phone with ninja and amazon and was basically told tough luck in the end apparently the year warranty doesn't cover the product not working i wouldn't recommend this product to anybody we have had this blender for four months and used it to make smoothies per day it works great it can't grind the way a vitamix does but for who cares my problem has been durability i have had to replace the lid the pouring spout broke and now the pitcher has developed a crack at the top corner the cost of replacing these two parts is in summary i love how it works but it's not durable and replacement parts are outrageously expensive my family is addicted to smoothies i'm going to look for a better quality blender i plugged and turn on and off in a second don't work at all i need it to return terrible i blended my smoothie for minutes trying to make it smooth had chunks in my smoothie nutribullet does a much better job mine broke so i thought i'd try the ninja but i'm returning it this blender is unsafe and unacceptable and it turns out in my research with the consumer safety products commission there are at least other reports of accidents with this blender it sent me to the er i made my smoothie in the office one morning with the blender poured the smoothie and everything was fine i went to simply place the blender in the sink and out of nowhere the blades popped out of the jar and flew at me they sliced across two of my fingers and i ended up needing stitches in one finger the other consumer safety complaints i read were because of the same thing the blades don't have a good internal locking mechanism and can just fall right out of the jar that is completely unacceptable do not buy this thing i'm in the process of filing a report as well what do yall mean perfect smoothie i been making smoothies in cheap blenders and vita mix blended for years and never had a problem i decided to buy the ninja professional and have been so disappointed in the texture they come out so airy and foamy the ice stays chunky the blade stick system is absolutely terrible i'm returning mine tomorrow way to expensive to not be happy with it won't do apples i purchased this to chop crush up apples into a mash for a small press i e to make cider no go no matter how i cut up the apples them etc and place them in the blender the center blades spin and nothing moves maybe just maybe it would blend other stuff now i have no use for this device i really thought this was going to be an awesome blender but lo it is not everything comes out chunky and finely chopped not blended i got mine second hand at about a third of the price and now i know why they sold it i can't imagine having spent on this i recommend the oster it has a glass carafe blends beautifully and is only at target this unit is labeled professional i bought one for a small scale professional kitchen in an office building i used it mainly for making breakfast smoothies to order marinades salad dressings and also occasionally for blended soups because it seemed so much quicker and more effective than using my little immersion blender the blender claims it can handle warm liquids i always let my soup cool in the freezer for minutes before i blended it and then warmed it back to after i only filled the blender half way to be safe still the gasket on the lid melted and after it cooled it would just drop chunks of rubber into whatever i used the blender for so i had tediously completely remove all the rubber from the lid to prevent contaminating food on top of this after about months tops of use there are stress cracks all over the pitcher again this kitchen is only open for breakfast and lunch days a week the blender does not get an overbearing amount of use at all i tried to talk to customer service online about replace the pitcher and asking if they had something that could handle warm temperatures better i was told all warranties would be void because it is for household use only i replied then why is it named ninja professional blender that is a bit misleading they said well that is just a name its for household use only i said between the misleading name and the snide customer service agent i don't feel compelled to buy another product from ninja next thing i saw your session has ended they hung up on me i actually printed out this chat record but never perused a complaint against them because i simply will never buy another product from ninja and will bash their product to anyone i ever speak to i actually inspected the box after all this it says professional in huge bold lettering on the top and all sides of the box only on the bottom of the box do you say for household use only and also nowhere on the amazon page to purchase it does it say this they do everything to trick you into thinking it can be used as a professional blender when it can not it is complete false advertising with a little thing on the bottom of the box to cover their ss when it breaks in months and they void the warranty this is a great blender i purchased for fathers day a few months ago i make a daily shake of whey protein a banana rolled oats ice and water this is the only thing i have ever tried to make in it i had an older black and decker model that wasn't blending that well anymore and was ready for an upgrade the ninja has tons of power it makes quick work of ice cubes with the tower of sharp crazy sharp blades it's straightforward and since the blades are removable i think it is easier than most to clean my two biggest gripes are that the pitcher assembly and lid only fit on one way i realize this is probably a safety feature but it can be a little tricky to get everything lined up if you aren't paying attention it's the same sort of first world problem as plugging in a usb cable second is the quality of the blend other reviewers have mentioned this i'll back it up it chops everything you put into it i have found no large ice chunks and everything gets incorporated pretty well what i'm missing is a smooth milkshake quality my black decker produced a smoother consistency even if it did have the occasional chunk of ice i classify the blend quality as grainy maybe closer to food processor quality and less smoothie quality so if you are going to be blending ice cubes and are expecting a smoothie experience you probably need to look elsewhere if this isn't a concern for you the ninja has blades and power for days if you're getting this to make smoothies don't buy it the design looks nice the blade chops food and ice quickly and effortlessly however liquefying fruit and veggies yuck good luck chewing your smoothie not smooth at all i used to have a cheap kitchen aid blender that made much smoother smoothies don't be fooled by the motor so disappointed and confused how the reviews are so high for smoothies i am in the process of returning this item it has significant power that cuts through seemingly whatever you put in the blades' path it does not liquify i purchased this item to make smoothies unfortunately my old cuisinaire does a better job takes longer and i need to finesse things however i get smoothies the ninja could not liquify green components like kale spinach and chard i brrought this blender for the sole purpose of blending green smoothies it was supposed to be an upgrade from my oster blender the ninja does not blend the fruit and the greens well at all i find myself chewing my smoothies yuck my cheaper oster blender blends my smoothies smooth and much better than the ninja such a disappointment please pass on this blender if you are buying it for green smoothie purpose i bought this for the office so that we could make more shakes smoothies but i just don't like it it doesn't make good smoothies at all no matter how long i blend it doesn't chop up the ice well enough or even the spinach i have a simple nutri bullet here and it works way better than the ninja my adult son and daughter recommended the vitamix but i opted for this ninja what a disappointment mine fell apart after using it times to make smoothies this morning i took it out and attempted to open the top it fell apart in my hands i am the only cook in this house and very careful with all of my appliances which usually last for decades it didn't even make good smoothies i decided to go with a classic blender instead and am very happy initially this blender was amazing it made smoothies better than anything i've ever used however after about months of regular but not frequent use it is no longer blending the way it used to ok so i have had this old hamilton beach blender since the s literally and it finally failed and no longer works i only use it to make shakes and smoothies with vegetables and fruit and protein powders and seeds basically i don't need to chop stuff or make soups or frozen margaritas so this review is from the perspective of someone who makes smoothies and shakes for health and dietary lifestyle i got this for at target thinking it looks great and has great reviews and has all these super blades so it must be good and work faster and operate better than what i had before wrong the good ease of use no buttons to think about just power settings basically very easy to clean love that the blades come off to clean it easier and the diamond shape is nice to get in there and clean the bottom with a sponge it's pretty quiet the bad this is the big problem i have and why i am going to return it the blades make it very difficult and basically impossible to put anything in there holy s t what a bad terrible design flaw and according to the manual you cannot insert the blade after you load stuff which would be convenient if you could nothing goes down that is not a powder or seed or small berries you have to sit there and cut and chop stuff prior to putting in my whole thing is i need these things to be quick and effective i make meals for myself throughout the day in the form of protein shakes and i don't want to spend time chopping up fruits and veggies the blade design is literally retarded and not conducive to any sort of practical operation i have used it for a few days now and no matter what i do i cannot get it to be smooth at all anytime i put anything solid in there like carrots beets apples etc it just makes it very grainy and to be honest it doesn't taste as good it's like eating goo with walnut chunks made of fruit or veggies it does not make anything smooth no matter what setting you try i like to just drink directly from the blender and not have to do extra dishes and waste a cup it is really annoying that the blades don't lock in they fall out very easily and it's difficult to handle them and it's annoying and again requires extra plates or napkins and stuff to make sure that the food dripping off the blades doesn't get on the countertop or table bottom line i can't say it doesn't work and it's not built well because it is but for someone like me who has a very active lifestyle and wants this to make my life easier and not have to wash dishes and spend time doing things it is very very bad it's difficult to incorporate into my lifestyle and doesn't allow me to make things quickly and then move on it takes x the amount of time for me to make smoothies and have this be ready for the next use compared to a crappy little engine that could that i got in after using the blender for over a week now i can't help but not write a review and wonder about the design meeting creative don't you think we should maybe make it circular not square so everything blends better and the contents don't hover in the corner like they do boss it's huge and its called 'ninja ' it will sell creative well some people like to put things in the blender while its in use like protein powders and kale and things but this blender has a tiny pour spout that you can only put about one berry at a time in so you have to stop the blender and take the top off every time you want to add an item or powder boss you worry too muuuuch its big and its called 'ninja ' bro it'll be alright creative but with the three blades you really can't fit too much in the blender to begin with so people are going to have to stop the blender to put things in like or times each time boss people are dumb 'ninja ' its big relaaaax creative can we at least put the spout in the front of the blender so customers users don't have to turn the blender around to put things in the tiny hole boss nin jahhhhh creative o k what about the blades there's nothing to keep them in the blender so when you pour you have to be careful of the blades will pop out into the glass you're pouring in and make a mess boss whispers ninjaaahhh creative it doesn't liquify it just kind of chops and mixes boss who's side are you on anyway go fetch me my samurai sword ninja boom creative i don't think ninjas and samurais were the same thing i'm going to go work for hamilton beach have a wonderful life and good day to you sir got it for husband he did not care for it the food get into handle this pitcher is not dishwasher safe ours melted ever so slightly and once that happens the lid won't fasten down properly and it won't power on even worse you cannot find the replacement pitcher for this model all the available replacement pitchers have a different mechanism at the bottom and don't fit with motor very aggravating we purchased this at walmart because it was the cheapest ninja available and now i know why this is a classic example of you get what you pay for i bought one of these for my son from a military px for the excellent price of i read in some reviews that the ninja is as good as the vitamix i have one of those too that i bought from sam's for the ninja is not as good as the vitamix the ninja does not grind up food as smoothly as the vitamix we made smoothies with the ninja and left it spinning for over minutes and still had a lumpy pulpy texture in the vitamix two minutes will produce a creamy smooth drink with no lumps or pulpy texture at all the ninja is good but it's not a vitamix there's a reason the vitamix costs so much more and there's a reason that most professional smoothy vendors use the vitamix and not a ninja i'm a vegan who makes protein powder greens frozen fruit smoothies for breakfast every day and wanted an adjunct blender at the girlfriend's house this is the one i chose for about at a rural bimart i'll be honest i have a vitamix at home and i love it i don't expect normal priced blenders to compete and so i run them for longer plus put less demand on them like using refrigerated greens instead of frozen like i do at home at first i was happy enough with this but perhaps i started adding too many extras which my vitamix can whip up easily oat bran chia seeds flax meal the last few days i've dumped out half of my breakfast because i'm just too tired of chewing my smoothie even though i decreased the amount of greens a note about the blade it takes care and management because it's a pole with six sharp staggered points on it there's an inattentive middle schooler in the house and i make certain it is never near him or ateas he frequents in the kitchen it's an accident waiting to happen i do like the square container the well sealing lid press button to release and the black marks on its side for volume in cups attractive conclusion i have decided to give this away my gf has a nutra ninja iq and it does noticably better at pulverizing ingredients and while its blade still takes management its bladed low height makes it simple to clean and keep safe in fact i'm online to buy additional nutra ninja iq blender cup lid sets i'd even say the nniq is a competetor to vitamix for people who want hard core smoothie abilities at a third of the price point of vitamix although you can save off vm by getting refurbished directly from manufacturer the nniq's smart button includes pauses which lets ingredients fall down replacing vitamix's plunger which works pretty well oddly for reasons i can't figure out better than the bottom of their line blendtec blender i tried out from costco a definite plus to the nniq is that the blender's base is small and its height is low absolutely enough to fit under the counter i'll store extra blender cups in cabinets anyway that's important to me because i like zero appliances on my kitchen cabinets but the gf who will probably be moving in to my place soon feels just as strongly about keeping the most frequently used ones out it's so small i can compromise for keeping the nniq out without taking too big of an ultimate hit would not buy again and do not recommend i've been waiting for my rd replacment for my ninja that i paid over for in i also paid for the warranty and still i'm sitting with no product i would never spend money on ninja blender products again don't do it buy another brand of blender ninja does not care we use the ninja for making smoothies we like our smoothies thick and put them in a container in the morning and drink them at lunchtime the ninja is far more powerful than the old c art machine it replaced and it can crush nearly any frozen fruit in seconds with no problem however it has two flaws it whips way too much air into whatever you are blending if you fill the blender half full of fruit water and protein powder and turn the machine on within seconds the machine is overflowing with foam so the resultant drink is very frothy at first i think too frothy but if you let that smoothie sit in a container for an hour or two the air bubbles work their way out and the end result is a half full container with a near solid mass at the bottom the old machine chopped the fruit without whipping in so much air the blades are deadly removable and held in place when the lid is on but the spout in the lid is not large enough to allow thick frothy smoothies to come out so you must remove the lid before you pour if you don't remove the blades first the blades can fall out the blades should lock into place or be held magnetically after months i am very disappointed with this blender it is bulky taking up the entire dish drainer and requires a lot of fussing each time i use it to put it together and then dissemble it to wash it i don't know why the blades are on a long stem that must be removed each time for washing the blades are very sharp and difficult to handle and i have already cut myself badly lifting them out to top it all off my smoothies come out with little pieces in them nothing like the creamy ones i made with my old hamilton beach i can't really see what this blender has going for it except that it can make huge amounts at a time what a piece of junk i've been using blenders for the last years and i realize that the life span of a heavily used one isn't that long which is why i invested in this product huge disappointment first of all it leaves smoothies very chunky and is unable to get things to a puree consistency then after a short period of use it started leaking are you kidding me i feel misled by what this product is supposed to do and now i feel robbed of the bucks it cost what a rip off not a good product at all this blender is simple and easy to use the container locks in place by turning it the lid also locks in place by lining up the handle and pushing down with a release button on top to remove the lid there's also a pour spout that works if the blended stuff is not too thick i mainly use the blender to make smoothies using frozen fruit and fresh fruit and vegetables and it does an okay job pulverizing and mixing everything together but not creamy like the description states i took a star away because i'm finding that i need to remove the lid in the middle of blending in order to push the contents back down to try and get everything blended better the frozen stuff blends well but some of the fresh does not my nutribullet did a far better job with my smoothies than this blender does also the blade inside the container does not lock in place and if you're used to just blending and pouring with the lid off beware that the blade will fall out and it's very sharp i hate the blade tower it takes up so much room in the cup it can fall out when pouring it makes loading the cup difficult and you better remember to put it in before loading the cup i prefer the kitchenaids suggested by a nutritionist i bought this for green smoothies i find that it doesn't blend the smoothies quite as smoothly as one might expect for a w blender not sure yet whether it's the order in which i've been adding the ingredients i let it blend for a while so i'm pretty sure time isn't a factor it's still better than the bullet type blender that i'd been using so i'll keep using it but i have a feeling i'll be better off when if i upgrade to a vitamix that seems to be one of the cadillacs of blenders i personally think this product is crap its not like what i seen on tv it just chop i've to use a smaller blender to finish off i was very disappointed with this blender all of my complaints are because of the middle blade tower it gets in the way of pouring smoothies out of the cup and is a pain to clean i prefer my old kitchenaid blender after three uses a crack developed along the bottom of the pitcher from one end to the other the only thing i ever blended was fruit their warranty states that i will have to pay for shipping to have it replaced at of the purchase price i don't even know if it's worth it based on my experience i do not recommend this blender would've been great if the product contained all the correct pieces like you know the blades my kitchaid finally bit the dust so i tried this blender i make veggie smoothies every day and this blender simply doesn't make the grade smoothies are granular so i went back to kitchenaid and couldn't be happier my blender from walmart worked better doesn't blend consistently i am left with chunks of veggies and water thankfully amazon will let me return this wow this blender sucks i was thinking for the price and the fact that its a ninja i was getting a good blender but this thing is horrible in every way if you want a chunky shake with big ice chips then this is the blender for you its not professional at all i'm mad that i have to waste time put this hunk of crap back in the box and drop it off at ups please change the name to nonprofessional blnder thanks for nothing i mean seriously the point of this blender is to blend and make smoothies and the point of a smoothie is smooth but the design of the blender doesn't create a vortex effect so things don't blend very well at all carrots spinach or kale all come out as chunks chunks i hate this blender on the second use the pitcher got stuck into the base it doesn't take a genius how to remove the pitcher waiting for them to send me a new one i am satisfied with this item horrible i am returning it really does not work at all commercial is a lies the ninja blender did not chop the vegetables fine enough for a smoothie even after several attempts larger leaf pieces were left if your the kind of person who believes that a smoothie is meant to be chewed then this is the blender for you for me i perfer my smoothies actually blended to a fine consistency so that it doesn't feel like i'm chewing a liquid salad i'll stick to vitamix or blentec i bought this primarily to use for grinding flax seeds which i have ground by use of an oster speed for years now after i initially set the ninja up i immediately experimented by grinding various amounts of flax seeds by use of my new ninja and here are my observations due to the jar and blade configuration of the ninja no fines compacted on the bottom hence you don't get the complication of consistently having to stop the blender to dig out the compacted fines on the bottom as one does with an oster how well and quickly the ninja can grind flax seeds does not appear to be dependent on the amount of flax seeds one starts with for any given grinding effort so you can grind a large batch with the ninja and the resulting grind quality will be identical to that of grinding several small batches with same this is not true when it comes to the oster at all the ninja cannot grind the seeds to dust as can the oster surprising but very true while i do have to add the seeds in much smaller batches when using an oster as well as stop and fiddle with getting the fines from the bottom the oster can in fact grind flax seeds to a uniform dust the ninja will put out more energy than the oster as can be detected by the warmth of the ground seeds but still not grinding the seeds to near as fine a mesh as the oster fine ground flax seeds are yellowish in color the seeds themselves are a reddish color when i use the oster the finish product is the desired yellowish color one indicator of a good grind whereas with the ninja it is a mixed yellow light red indicating non uniformity in the level of the grind you can also easily feel the ninja's finish product is not uniformly powdery of course so compared to the oster the ninja can grind much much larger batches at one time and does not require any additional effort but at a lower grind quality mesh and uniformity than the oster i would have given it stars if the ninja were capable of both grinding larger amounts and achieving a uniform fine mesh as it stands i would give it a rating if that were an option this is a really good looking product fits under your counter and does a reasonable job for average applications i have owned a variety of smoothie makers and blenders at every price point what i noticed is that blenders that have a stick blade fail to really pulvertize the food because there are a number of blades on the stick it seems like it's going to grind your food up really well however i did not find that because the machine didn't have the power handle an ultra smooth puree ultra smooth purees is quality i was looking for i like to make spinach smoothies i placed my frozen fruits and liquid in and then attempted to add my spinach because of the blades being so high up i struggled to get the spinach down into the machine even if you place the spiniach in first the side blades make it difficult to get them down in the blender once the machine running after several attempts i realized that my smoothie was not going to liquefy completely so it's texture was rather grainy to the taste although it looked smooth additionally i did not find the handle comfortable and making sure everything was locked and clicked into place was an added nuisance i also fear these plastic lid parts are going to break off soon it was easy to clean up but for heavy daily use i don't think this is going to work out i liked the product generally but i'm rather underwhelmed by it's lack of power as a baker i also do a lot of nut and fruit purees and this machine isn't going to cut that i think calling this a professional blender is a marketing name because this machine isn't capable of giving professional results yes it chops ice but if you are looking to blend your things into ultra smooth purees this machine falls short loved this opener for two months until it stopped retracting the cork not much use if it cannot pull the cork no amount of charging will get it to work properly won t last more than a month worked great at first i barely use it but the bottom seemed to split and now it barely charges i only drink stella rosa wine so pretty standard cork this opener slowly grinds up the cork and dies mid way down off to the store for a new one it's difficult to use i'd rather an old fashioned cork screw lasted months and even when fully charged for more than a day stops operating half way through the cork can't return now b c after days so total waste of money will look for a better quality option fell apart and didn't last but few months we had previous version of this product and lasted us years in the second time using it broken the botton to up the cord doesn t work more i m very sad and disappointed with this product worked great for about bottles up down switch quit working would only turn in one direction and now switch doesn't work at all only had this product like months and or bottles of wine to open and quit i used it twice and it doesn t work anymore broke on the nd time i used it had metal pieces fly out from the screw spend the extra cash and get a nicer one just stopped working after year of minimal use very disappointing worked great for about months then stopped working ok i thought it was great but after months it no longer works i want to return it but according to site no longer returnable do not buy one of these trying to figure out now how to contact amazon and seller to let them know i wasted my money on this opener i have used this for months and it wasn t great but now it is unusable takes a couple of times to get cork out doesn t come out on first try now the cork is jammed stuck on the inside of tube cannot come out and now doesn t work at all the return window is closed and i m screwed don t buy this i ordered two of these at the same time for two different houses one works fine the other will not take anything but a small charge the small charge does not open a wine bottle at all so i have to use a normal corkscrew very disappointed in this there is no way to pull the cork out we bought this product years ago and love it finally had to replace it in march it did not last a month and quit working opened bottles of wine and it broke what a piece of junk loved it at first broke after uses this was a great tool at first but months later would not recharge and is useless have used multiple times since getting it and it has yet to open a bottle for me it screws into the cork pulls it half way out then let's go of the cork it doesnt do as the description says unfortunately i had this in a box waiting to move to our new apt unit just now i tried it for the st time today and it's not easy to use at all in order to pull the cork out i had to have my boyfriend do it and i'm not a weak girl by any means i've been weight training for over years and i'm not talking lb weights lol totally wish i would have tested it out sooner because i would've returned it now i'm stuck and back to using the good old manual opener i had it for months and died very disappointed this thing lasted about three months maybe six and that broke not worth the love the look and was excited to use it unfortunately the first time it broke we were opening a very nice wine and it stuck in the cork without uncorking it all the way we did get it to unscrew from the cork it it never worked right after that don t buy this just bought already broke with no reverse very unhappy broke less than a year old the wine bottle opener worked successfully one time and never worked correctly again some corks will not come out of the bottle at all then on the last try the cork did come out of the bottle but the cannot be ejected from the opener and remains stuck rendering the opener useless i chose this brand because i have had other oster appliances in the past that were of good quality however this item was very disappointing will not purchase any oster products in the future does not pull cork all the way out of the bottle would not hold charge returned for refund purchased a different brand sadly i purchased this as a gift for my mom for christmas since her other one broke and after two months it stopped working properly it will not let you remove the cork because it only turns one way difficult to use bought one after three weeks it quit working got a replacement and after three weeks it does not work doesn't charge now it is too late to return it don't buy a total rip off absolutely terrible product have used twice both times straight off the charger and appears that the battery doesn t hold a charge tempermental use a reliable old fashion cork screw it worked fine for a dozen or so bottles eventually the screw got crooked and would no longer screw into the cork straight then the battery died and would no longer hold a charge and it's a soldered in unbranded battery so i didn't bother trying to replace it gone back to 'old fashioned' battery free wine bottle openers that will out last this thing by x we tried this opener multiple times and it never opened a bottle it would just rotate one way or the other without pulling the cork out would love to return it but missed the window of return broke after use i drink a bottle maybe every few weeks plugged it in and got ready to use it and after traditional cork use it would not work again now i don't even see the option to return it it is already broken i think it should last a little longer that that mine was defective after using it just twice the nd time it broke my bottle now it wont pull the cork out i am a bartender and bought this for a private event i was bartending i was so embarrassed and disappointed when it broke after the th or th bottle this is my second one it works good for the price but they do not last doesn t work as expected second one to die in last yr this one we bought in august works fantastic when working usually battery issue will try diff brand today this bottle opener takes a few tries before removing a cork difficult to work only lasted five months before it stopped working this latest about a month we used it only times worked great until it broke today the cork was a bit dry but i think the real issue is the plastic piece the corkscrew is attached its ok has been doing the job the package missed the bottle holder chiller i bought this opener in january and it worked great at first after opening about bottles by mid march the opener no longer would operate correctly the screw would go into the cork but the charger then did not have enough power to pull the cork out of the bottle even though it is constantly in the charger it has lost the power to operate correctly after having purchased this item i then read the bad reviews and discovered that this problem is frequent and the company does not honor it's warranty what a scam i will never buy another oster jarden product and amazon should stop carrying this junk half the time the cork does not exit from the chamber you have to use a pliers to hold the cork so it can be removed i wish i could return the item but it is too late don't by this item i got this plugged it in used it times worked great then it stopped holding a charge the light on top went out and it never worked again i bought this over a month ago i went to use it today and the corkscrew pulled out of the mechanism so the cork is still in my bottle of wine with the cork screw in it i ve had this for months now it s broke corks get stuck and when you try to remove you break the cheap plastic housing if i could give this product a zero i would this wine bottle opener does not work at all it does not remove corks instead it just breaks them do not buy this opener i just used it foer the st time last night and it broke need to return this is a total waste of money only pulls half the cork out then it breaks off and u can't get the rest of it out tried different ways to use it just doesn't work it broke within the first five uses poor quality and was a waste of money don t waste your money i purchased in november and it s broken already never worked properly to begin with it would only pull the cork halfway out and break in half sounds like mine worked a little longer than everyone else's about six months but now it won't hold a charge i keep it on the charger and i know it charges a little because it sounds like it's working at first but then it slows way down and eventually stops with the cork about halfway out after it stops there's nothing you can do but awkwardly yank on it obviously it's not designed to pull out a cork this way so it always breaks the cork apart and causes a mess complete waste of money i bought this as a gift for christmas and my friend hasn t tried to use it until this past weekend the down button does not work it s defective i m very disappointed and i d like to return it so i can get her one that actually works broke the first time i used it and cant get the cork out not so good piece worked good for about a year could be coincidence that the warranty is up about the same time it quits working broke on the first cork i opened i purchased this as a gift it sounds like it barely has enough power to open one bottle when you use it there is no way it would open i would buy a better quality one next time this one isn't worth the money stopped working after the first charge worst possible corkscrew you could ever own didn't use it until after the holidays and discovered in every instance that it obliterated the cork causing particles to descend into the wine rendering it undrinkable unless filtered could not make it work even once and because we waited to keep trying it so we didn't just waste good wine the jackasses at amazon would not let me return it it's now in the trash wasted time rethinking my prime membership too stopped working after a month after the first use it broke item doesn t work have had many oster items got back from honduras and apparently missed the return window won t open a bottle did not work at all did not last very long had another one like it and it lasted for years this one lasted about a month it came scratched and scuffed up i didnt use it so i can't comment on that because of the damage i will be returning this broke three months after i bought it cork screw broke right in bottle we used this once and it is broken quit working after month of use would not pull the cork out but would eject the cork thought this was one of the best not buying oster products again works okay using this properly it pushed the first three corks in to the bottle so i threw it out i ended up returning this item as it did not screw unscrew straight up and down this wine opener doesnot work very well it needs several tries to open a bottle it's not a sturdy opener intricate to put together have only had it just over a year and the button fell off used this thing once and it broke had use pliers to unscrew the cork as it broke into the bottle ended up throwing the thing in the trash shame because i got it based of a recommendation of a friend extremely bad product it s said can open wine easily i can said it only can open half and break left other half cap on the bottle it wasted my red wine highly recommend do not buy this product you will regret didn't work works ok i guess but it's one more thing on my countertop but i can operate a corkscrew just as fast and that stays in the drawer lol doesn t work it leaves cork inside didn t like it at all it doesn't work breaks the corks every time did not work item broke in less than months and cannot be replaced this was a christmas gift for my wife worked great for a couple of months easily removing most corks then despite a full charge it could drill into a cork but then stopped and couldn't remove one don't waste your money i have had this since the end of december and have probably used it a maximum of times and now it is no longer working it broke the second time i used it if you like to use an opener consecutive times on the same wine bottle and still have to remove the cork manually then this is just for you garbage not strong at all foil cutter is great used the wine opener four naybe times and the cork screw broke completely off the opener takes the cork out of the bottle but i have to use a screw driver to remove the cork from the opener i would not recommend this brand to anyone because of the screwing motion which is a bit slow your standard lever type work much quicker they'll almost certainly take up less space than this too very excited to purchase my very own electric wine opener so occasionally i can have a glass of wine but unfortunately this product did work at all have not yet retrieve the cork from the wine bottle very disappointed had it months and still working fine gifted this to my mom for xmas getting around to using it now and it won't charge how do i request a return already broken my manual rabbit works quicker and on the first try i had to try or times before the cork would come out the bottle far enough to finish pulling it out thank god it wasn t a real hard cork that expands after it comes out but one of those soft smooth ones i returned it it takes about attempts to bring the cork half way up it does not remove completely you then have to remove it with a conventional cork screw while this is cordless it must be plugged in all the time get a battery operated opener if you want truly cordless works well on real cork corks does not work well on synthetic corks they didn't say it would love it then it broke to easily not made to last makes my kitchen looks nice but about open wine actually don't work half of the time don't work for plastic corks old bottle garbage took different times to get one cork out of a regular wine bottle defective item purchase at your own risk it stop working after a few months ours died on us at won't charge anymore not impressed goes on nicely but does not pull the cork out works great but the product is very bulky i wish that it was more petite and easier to store it s kind of an eye sore on the counter when i first saw this wine opener i had a i've got to have it moment after purchasing this item i was in heaven opening wine bottles was a breeze the foil cutter is awesome and i love the long battery life on this opener i loved this product so much i bought multiple for gifts for friends family members months later the down button which removes the cork from the bottle stops working knowing that oster aka sunbeam products aka jarden consumer solutions has a year limited warranty stated in product manual i wasn't worried i emailed customer service about my issue weeks later i got a response requesting information in order to process the return the same day i respond to the email with all the information asked another week goes by without a response i email customer service to make sure they received my email with all my information and not only did they let me know they did receive my email but the product was no longer covered under warranty i responded to customer service with the exact words from their handbook stating that their product has a one year warranty and have yet to get a response so if you are thinking about purchasing this wine opener keep scanning for something else this is not the one for you tldr don't buy this product it is not made well and customer service isn't interested in fulfilling their warranty i bought and returned two of these both quit working within a couple of weeks and had only been used a few times not sure why this is listed as a best seller it's cheap for a reason it doesn't work not happy once again no power apparently not charging same thing happened to the previous one doesn t open bottles bought this opener the end of september and happily used it through the holidays the beginning of january it stopped working only months use now i have to purchase a new one won't buy this brand again only used product a handful of times and it broke we have bought two of these in recent years and each has failed in the exact same manner starts out great and with time a year or two the thing loses extraction power and eventually is unable to complete the removal of even a lightly placed cork the batteries that oster uses for this item are crap plain and simple they do not hold a charge over time beware looks nice and works great for little while and then becomes a useless paper weight shame on oster go source better batteries there are tons out there today for cheap wouldn t take the whole cork out and broke after uses this flimsy product stopped working after about months of light use i contacted the manufacturer jarden consumer solutions through its website noting among other things the date on which i purchased the product after days jarden finally got back to me by requesting additional information such as certain codes written on the product i provided that information promptly and received another email requesting yet additional information i provided that information i then received an email from jarden stating that there was nothing that they would do and that they would not replace the product i was especially disappointed to receive such a response after having been sent on a wild goose chase for the various information they had requested from me i responded to jarden by expressing my dissatisfaction and by asking them to stand by their product and replace it they responded by saying that there was nothing they would do stay away from oster and from jarden brands it worked fine for about a month and then just quit it was fully charged and i can i get it to work again i like love story the most and the oster cordless opener the least it sometimes fails to pull the cord off the bottle broke after three bottles another gadget i got caught up with i an open the bottles manually without all the fuss but it surely does the job nicely if one wants an electric opener i absolutely did not like it at all and it's headed for a yard sale since it's too much trouble to send it back the corkscrew part is far too short to go down into the cork far enough to remove the cork the foil cutter part works fine but overall i am extremely disappointed and should have known better than to order a cheapie my bad i ordered this at a lighting deal and intended to give it as a chrstimas gift however it might have missed the part in the description with regards to the packaging because it came in a nondescript box with the label attached to it and the item right inside the box was ripped when i received it i thought that maybe the manufacturer's box was inside but nope i couldn't give it as a gift because it looked cheap i kept it for myself but i rarely use it anyway i love this product but this is my second one and only worked for a month or two need to exchange this opener did not work for me or a friend of mine who also had one and had the same problems i could not get the cork to come out of the bottle i tried numerous times and could not get this thing to work properly i wanted to like it but it just didn't get the job done pulls the cork out fine but it wont unscrew cork from opener without using a fork to keep the cork from spinning around inside opener after having this item for less than months it did not work called amazon was told by representation that i had to call oster called them today after two or three tries was told by oster it was a good product it has a one year warranty they are shipping a new one of which i was told it was a one time only question why does amazon not handle this problem hopefully with the replacement cordless wine bottle opener i have a year warranty first time ever to have to return a product also i just purchased a waffle maker from cuisinart do i have a warranty i got this for a christmas gift it worked on bottles and when i tried the third it's now not working it hasn't even been one month it spins but won't move up or down i was looking forward to this gift for months disappointed have to twist and pull the cork out manually since it simply stalls in the middle of extraction it was ok for first five months but no longer not what i expected it is always in its charger i ve tried it on multiple wine bottles since it started to fail thinking that it was an odd case with of a stubborn cork unfortunately not doesn't uncork very well worked well enough for months this was a good wine bottle opener until it decided not to work very disappointing would not recommend i had to send back it didnt work this wine opener broke the first time i used it don t buy this item worked great until the battery gave out had less than months all though this product works great when it is working i can't give it more tha star as the battery goes bad very quickly and won't recharge then try and get a replacement part oster won't pick up the phone there is no where to leave a message and can't find this part anywhere bad product and then really bad customer service bad review i bought this after using my friends i love the convenience but after only a short time mine started to have trouble releasing the cork from the opener at least i could drink wine while trying to get the cork out but i was hoping for a better performing g gadget i love these battery powered wine bottle openers this is my second one unfortunately my experience thus far indicates they deserve a disposable label since neither has lasted more than months thought the first one was defective as the motor gave out after a year but the second one lasted only years expiring in the same fashion i guess i've resolved myself to the fact that this is not a durable product and will henceforth lower my expectations when it worked it was great bought this to replace our manual one which we had for years but after a few uses it jammed a few time may have been user error at first but was still frustrating actually bought a different bottle opener so don't use as much i was really excited to use this but it takes multiple tries to take the cork out i can use the manual bottle opener faster cork difficult to remove from opener sometimes as it won't drop back down when pushing button opposite direction my old opener always unscrewed cork from opener doesn t work just makes hole waste of the charge light remains red which is a bit confusing i mean you would expect the light turn green once it's fully charged but it doesn't it remains red at all time i think this is a great electric wine bottle opener consider it is my first one it's stylish and easy to use very cool easy open had difficulty using a few times works great but only lasts about a year after a couple of months the batteries leaked so i had to throw it out stopped working after months this worked fine for awhile a couple years but the backside of the opener is made of a black rubbery plastic material which over time breaks down and becomes sticky no amount of cleaning was able to remove the stickiness because it seems to be the plastic itself that is melting so while the motor still works and the unit is technically still functioning we can no longer used it and have replaced it with a different brand that is stainless all the way around it came without the charging cord for the base so first impressions so far are no bueno opener hasn t worked properly since day i allowed the opener to charge an entire week before use at first i thought perhaps i was not operating it correctly my husband also made several attempts with no success the screw pierces the wine cork but does not pull the cork from the wine bottle the item is useless i would have rated it as star but i give more star for its modern metro design don t waste your money on this it removes the cork effortlessly however the button to reverse the cork out of the wine opener is too difficult for my wife to press i have to press the button with a lot of pressure for it to begin reversing the cork out i think it was assembled poorly it is as if the button is not aligned well i would take my chances in buying it again if needed this product is terrible it does not have the power to move the cork it worked one time out of about tries total waste of money we want to return it but do not see that option on the amazon site this device does not charge fully and loses its power quickly very dissapointing product it worked for a short time and then stopped after months of using it around once or twice a month the battery became so week that it can not pull the cork out of the bottle it is fully charged and still can t open a bottle wast of money wine opener works great came with the charging stand but the box did not include the cord to plug in the charger doesn't really work very well first bottle did pretty good second bottle i gave up after tries and just used my standard wine bottle opener i'd rather return it but i feel bad since i've been returning a lot of disappointing products lately stopped charging after months we did not receive plug in so we returned item piece of junk not enough power to pull the cork out waste of money came competely destroyed and not in original packaging it takes multiple attempts to remove cork got this as a gift from a gift exchange new product after the first hr charge tried opening a bottle of wine the screw goes into the cork and comes right back out leaving the cork in the bottle have tried x so far w the same results we'll try again over the holidays but so far this is a waste of kitchen counter space standard manual openers work a lot better than this i don t care for this didn t work well worked for about months then broke stopped working completely i m not sure about this product i have tried it twice and does not work well broke after uses we have used this to open about bottles of wine and it doesn't function properly any longer the quality of the product is poor but i do suppose in line with the price you pay bette off buying an inexpensive manual opener and working for your wine instead of attempting to be lazy and use this thing worked for about a month and now battery wont charge at all crap product no instructions or packaging included this was a gift and recipient didn't know what it was we are very disappointed with this product it never worked as easily as wine openers we had in the past now it stops working half way through opening a bottle we bought this months ago and it has stopped working great for the price it does the job however the product is cheaply made doesn't work opener stopped working after about months purchased july the one that i got a few years back came with a tool to remove the wrap foil on the top of the wine bottles and this did not come with that tool luckily i still have the one had one of these that lasted for years the last one we bought quit working properly after a month would not reverse to remove the cork by the time it took to remove the cork i can use a waiters opener and be done with it just not a great product like it was years ago product stopped recharging after months this worked well for two months and has now stopped working because the opener is not charging despite the light being on failed in months of light use oster failed to respond to my complaint it is a great item when it works but it is certainly not dependable or durable doest work as expected bad quality stopped working after a few months this is the second time we ordered as a gift for friend the product is good but the box is so cheap it s just in a cheap carton box no picture or anything the first time we order it came in a original box which was nicer as a gift update this is the fourth times we ordered the product since our family member want one as a gift well this time is really bad they wasn t even put the product in the box to ship the product is just by itself with shipping label the box of product itself was no damage if i order for myself i don t mind however this is a gift does not meet my expectations i would suggest that people look a bit more before buying the switch on the front works intermittently and unless you are someone who would use an opener really often you may not notice it right away we only have wine occasionally and only tonight tried to use it without a lot of success i ended up getting most of the cork out but had to take it the rest of the way out by hand only a couple months before it broke it no longer works when you push the forward button cork pulling direction but the reverse still works which renders the unit useless doesn't last long great product till it dies don't waste your money buy something more dependable and will last longer while the electric wine opener works it's no more easy than using a rabbit style opener and i find it more cumbersome i'm a wine lover and even though i bought this i'm in the i don't see the point camp i'd rather have something that i can keep in a drawer and not plug in to charge debbie lee wesselmann this is awful the cork sometimes comes out by the third try ready for the garbage bought of these one of them the actual opener's battery failed died the other is still going strong just is frustrating that one completely died the charger was fine the uunit itself broke it worked great for about months and now nothing i agree this thing sucks i have to put it through like times before the cork even comes halfway out then at that time i just pull it the rest of the way out only good thing about this is the foil cutter works well my daughter bought this for me as a gift and it looked great and i'm a pretty talented handywoman but i could never get it to work gave it to the salvation army i purchased it plug it in fifteen minutes later it started smoking and the lights went out rendering it completely dead thank god i was home when it happened had problems with it from the start it broke after a couple of weeks waisting money time and your energy you have to try to put it in the cork multiple time while pushing it hard back to the winged style wine opener which is way easier and faster does not work pooped out after only times of use used it maybe times the down button doesn't work at all too late to return waste of money this worked great to open a bottle of wine easily about once a month but then stopped working a few years later the charging dock was also a little bulky does not last used times and it stopped working unfortunately waited too long to return item worked really well for awhile then just quit after about yrs of light use i've gone through of these and the batteries only last about a year if you recharge it only when it gets slow if you keep it in the charger all the time you have two bright red ugly lights on continuously i won't buy another one this is a disappointment it won't pull a cork out of any of the bottles i've tried it on it never worked and i was super excited about this is almost exactly years old just slowly stopped working will not charge next to useless worked once second time to three tries third time five tries and fourth time seven tries to get the cork out broke the first time it was used i bought of theses for presents and one for my self they don t work the cork doesn t come out absolutely useless do not buy totally a waste of money works ok average quality spiral cork remover bends easily bought this in september and does no longer work properly in november the opener fits securely in the charger base and the indicator light is working however the opener has little charge and will stop working about the way into the cork very disappointed since my previous model lasted for years we loved the wine opener until it stopped working after a year disappointing only lasted just over months broke after months mine was a gift and it worked well for years or so but now it doesn't charge oster seems fully committed to the planned obsolescence model so you're expected to dispose of this device and buy a new one if yours stops charging from oster site the wine openers do not have any replaceable parts except for the foil cutter on some models you will need to buy a new opener to get a replacement battery pack i've just gone back to my metal manual type the one that looks like it's doing jumping jacks very easy to use that is at least years old and will last forever or at least be recyclable this opener is just too much plastic junk to be disposable i don't believe in the infinite availability of finite resources and neither should any human on this shrinking planet with its vast ocean dead zones and birds fish filled with plastic waste wouldn t hold charge after months had this one previously it lasted years lasted years with no problems now won t charge i was expecting it to last longer we have owned this just over a year we have only needed to charge it three times and now it will not take a charge at all useless would not buy it again did not work for very long i dont think it works all that well i dont love it this is a complete waste of money every time you use it the cork gets stuck up inside it worst design ever do not buy this this was well reviewed across a number of sites i researched prior to buying i felt pretty good about it and purchased unfortunately it has already died after opening maybe bottles no idea why but it simply won't go through a cork anymore it lives on its charging base so i know it's not a battery issue bums me out did i get a lemon didn't work terrible pushed cork into both bottles i attempted to open strained to even insert the corkscrew into the cork returned does not work thought i would like this but can't tell if it's me or i got a lemon because it hasn't worked once the mechanism goes down into the cork but has yet to pull the cork up out after pushing the button up what actually happens is that it chews up the cork and makes it twice as difficult to get it out when i then resort to using a normal manual opener lost confidence using it on a nice bottle of wine and way weird if you try doing this in front of a guest i bought is for a gift but it came in a brown utilitarian box and not the manufacturer oster box the presentation would not look good without the original box so i am returning it never worked after a month of trying then i trashed it it broke after months used for only bottles in total i hated it anyway because it did not open wine that well stopped working on the th day go figure of course bc it can't be returned now don't waste your money on this fell apart after a few months it worked well until it stopped charging junk just ok more or less gets the job done the gearing seams week to me time will tell i have had it months it dies it will not take a charge not worth the money i will be shopping for a new one today it will not be an oster this is our second oster cordless opener the first one lasted about years and worked great unlike the first opener the new one doesn't work on the new rubber silicon corks it pulls them fine but doesn't eject them without wedging them with something works well but the back half is made of poor plastic which has become very sticky from exposure to alcohol trying to clean it made it more sticky now it is disgusting to hold it better to buy a all steel opener purchased sept th quit working october th by quit working i mean that it would no longer able to drill into the cork or pull it out it would simply tear up the cork we resorted to a manual winged version and threw this in the trash very disappointing to spend and have it work less than months this was our rd wine bottle opener so i speak from experience that it isn't worth the cost or frustration of having ground corks generally cordless electric wine bottle openers are very worth having compared to the manual bottle openers just not this one cheers i've had an oster wine opener for years love it but the corkscrew needs to be changed i can't find instructions on how to do this so i ordered a new one hoping it would maybe come with a book showing me how and also have a list of spare parts but the new didn't have anything like that it doesn't work near as good as my old one it seems to uncork release the cork much slower than my old one works good only problem is i had a little hard time removing the cork from it i had to pull it out myself they could not open wine bottles consitenly worked wonderfully for the first couple of months after that it stopped charging even thought the base showed it had power to it goes down but does not bring the cork up amazon wont allow me to return it not effective at pulling cork out with ease as a senior citizen got this to save struggling with opening corks it works but is not trouble free either the wine opener only lasted a few months and then quit working the rocker switch control button works maybe of the time to remove the cork from the bottle it works of the time to unscrew the cork to remove it from the opener it seems like a short of some sort repeatedly pressing the button sometimes makes it work like there's a short or bad solder joint of some sort i was getting ready to return it and noticed the return window closed days ago maybe if i drink more wine i would not have missed that return window i suppose now that it can't be returned i may as well open the thing up and see if i can repair it myself it never screwed into the cork straight and i had to do it several times just to get the cork out it broke on the th bottle i would not recommend this product to anyone it broke before the first time charging it it wouldn't hold a charge and couldn't pull up the cork very disappointing works but still have some difficulty not sure if it's a product problem or the cork itself great wine opener but it is a shame that the batteries died after only months i was even careful to only charge the batteries when it ran completely out of juice if at least oster had used nimh batteries instead of the old and environmentally unfriendly nicd technology i could have swapped the batteries easily this is not good for the environment it works great for about months then the screw part loses its sharpness and will not pull corks out the last one of these we had died in less than a year because it would no longer sit squarely on the base and could no longer charge we looked everywhere for some sort of obstruction but it seems that something had simply failed inside fair enough it is pretty cheap we took it to be an anomaly and bought another one that lasted just a little over three months before failing in the exact same way obviously it is now time to switch brands too bad this product when it was reliable was a good value apparently there's been some cost cutting or unintended change very disappointed had owned this same product for last years that opener finally died and we bought a new one however this new one has not worked since day one would not recommend it never worked well from first time we bought it finally bought a different product wish i could get my money back after having this piece of junk for a couple of months it doesn't work it can only pull the cork out half way i have stopped using it now this is a waste of money opens bottles on a single change completely false we've had it on the charger since we bought it and it could only open about three bottles before dying and now it can't even open a single bottle even when fully charged and the cork is stuck inside of it you'll end up buying a new one every year and the red light is annoying this broke the neck of my wine bottle and ruined the whole bottle of wine i received this product and charged it fully now not months later it only works when in the letting go direction hence not being able to pull out the cork its good for getting into cork however you still have to pull manually to get cork out i thought in reversed and electrically pulled cork out plus is the little foil cutter instantly removes foil no more poking fingers or cutting self stars for still manual pulling of cork opens bottles fine but won't eject cork without help this item was a replacement for a similar one which worked very well for a couple of years this one died after only a couple of months just replaced it with a different brand i cant say much about this product from the beginning it did not work right it did not pull the cork all the way up or it wont release the cork out it broke less than weeks waist of money i have bought of these in the last years the first one broke after about months the second one broke in days the last one broke after about months buy a different brand do not waste your money on this wine opener this is my second oster opener the first one lasted for or years and worked well this one acts like it's low on charge but the red light on top indicates that it is charging no there is not a cork stuck inside how long is the warranty on these charger dont work correctly already doesn't work very dissatisfied will never buy again only worked for months bought this as a christmas gift and it stopped working months ago i had one of these at home so decided to buy one for our summer home when i went to use it it doesn t work not very happy not too crazy about this item it seems flimsy and not as sturdy as another brand we have had in the past it is a bit difficult to get the wand back into the base holder we will keep it and use it but will look at other brands if we need to purchase another one this product does not work it drills into the cork and it comes out empty it just does not pull the cork out this was tried on several different bottles i ve had this electric wine opener for months and it just randomly stopped charging we ve tried looking to see if there are dust particles preventing it to charge and we cleaned it nothing i'm very upset that i bought it about months ago and it has recently stopped working of course it's past the date when i could return it i'm really mad we also don't use it that often i have bought two of these because they work great when they work there is a flaw somewhere in their charging station both lasted less than a year just lost the connection to charge fought with it for quite awhile putting something in between the holder and the opener trying to make the charging prongs connect but finally giving up on the second one and will now try a different brand this product will not hold a charge used twice it did not work well i think it never get fully charged i might have received a defected product it is too late to return lost my money i purchased this about cases of wine ago it still works perfectly design wise it is okay except for me i do not like the red light it would be so much more attractive with a blue green or even a white light we keep it hidden i purchased this item months ago and the button that extracts the cork is broken and and the opener doesn't work at all i would say the opener was used on less than occasions before finally becoming unusable it stopped charging very soon and became useless for us i bought this from the amazon prime best seller i bought it in january and it has a one year warranty but it doesn't work now in august how do i get a replacement or refund i can not click on the product details icon in help product delivered july th broken by end of august probably opened bottles ok a little flimsy it doesn't operate quite the way i expected i have only opened two bottles so far i live a dull life but it seems you have to gently nudge it down and eventually the bottle will spin so be sure to keep it on a flat surface it seems i have to fight with it until it gets one turn of the screw securely in it's made of plastic seems kinda cheap you press down on button for entry and up to remove the cork from screw i would return it but i get return fatigue bought it april and by august it was totally useless it started out so well and we were really happy with it but at some point in a few months the charging capability simply stopped working the red light remains on but it got weaker and weaker with each use until yesterday it stopped working entirely i wasn't so excited to get this because it seemed so easy and hassle free wrong i've read the directions watched tricks on youtube this wine opener sucks i have to put it through multiple times to get it to lift the cork and then i have to push the cork around with my thumb to have it move and wiggle out it's very frustrating when you're having a dinner party and you're the host trying to have a nice night horrible i've asked other friends who have this and they have also said they've used it one or two times and threw it in the drawer because it sucks go the old fashion way don't get this one month use and stop working trash it did not work the power was slow it got stuck in cork and would not come out at full charge maybe it was just the model i had was great until it broke in normal use please advise if replacement can be made i bought this because my neighbor had the same one and loves it had had it for two years and it's running great i plugged mine in ann's tried to use it the next day and something is wrong with the button it works like it had a short in it it starts to work then stops then works then stops didn't last opened about bottles and broke update after fewer than two dozen uses it quit working altogeter don't buy this you're throwing your money away if you do i did when i threw this away we should be able to rate something no stars i have owned used a number of electric wine openers over the years and this is the absolute worst i have ever seen wine is a major interest of mine and i have tried a number of brands don't waste your money it's incredibly slow doesn't work at all on even real cork stoppers i recommend the rabbit first the houdini second i regret i didn't take the time to send this back and i won't buy another one item arrived not working would not charge ended up purchasing a aicok cordless battery powered electric wine opener and love it broke after uses don't buy from this vendor purchase month ago worked well however don't expect it to last i purchase two different brands without any longterm success with either brand in the end i've gone back to using the old conventional cork screw removal at least it will probably outlast me in longevity please let me know if you find an electric opener worthy of consideration need a new one it's a birthday gift to someone else broke after uses never really pulled cork out completely had a nice foil cutter attachment but just didn't work well returned product first i would like to start off by saying this is the third wine bottle opener from oster that i have purchased and the same model i had to buy replacements because the first one i damaged myself by inserting it into the cork a bit crooked and the second i carelessly left in a hotel room i truly enjoyed this wine bottle opener which is why i went back to it again i believe it is well priced for the product and does the job easily and efficiently much easier than the do it yourselfers where you have to work hard to get the bottle open for some reason the one i purchased in late march just won't hold a charge and i followed the instructions per the user guide when i try to use it the cork takes a long time to come out of the bottle and then the mechanism will not release the cork so i have to manually work it out myself making it much more difficult than a handheld as for a return it's far past the date you only get a month to return it to amazon when i called customer service at oscar the line had six callers ahead of me and i just don't feel this product is worth the time and effort to go through the motions of getting a warranty replacement i'll just try something new i received this item and used it for a week before discarding the packaging to my dismay it stopped working a week later quit working after a few weeks had this less than a year and it stopped working properly my wife drinks wine most nights so it was used once every few days not very durable i will likely not buy it again the product never worked the corkscrew would not come down from the column to screw into the cork to remove it i'm going back to the good old hand levered corkscrew at least my hand and wrists work and can remove a cork it stopped working in months does not remove cork sadly i thought it was just a 'fluke' the first time i used it and missed the window to return so now for no good reason it is dead completely have always charged it per the instructions never left the charger plugged in etc and now nothing very very very unhappy and would not recommend purchasing bought in november dead in july didn't even open bottles of wine the plastic button broke after opening only two bottles of wine very disappointed thought we would use it we don't hard to work worked great for about a year then broke i got this for my wife for christmas and it stopped working in july the reverse button works but the forward wine opener direction stopped i took it all apart to see if i could fix the button but it had actually melted scary now i'm shopping for a different one waste of money i had the old one for years before a cork got jammed inside and finally killed the unit so i got the same product to replace it however i've already noticed that the charge doesn't last anywhere as long as the old one i rarely had to charge the old one and yet it was always ready and always worked with this one unless you keep it in the charger and plugged in constantly it loses it's charge almost immediately i don't like it cluttering up my counter and always plugged in but if i want it to work when i need it i have no choice i guess that if i wasn't spoiled by the old unit i wouldn't be so disappointed but for me this brings it down to just an ok product the product broke just after the return window this product is a real scam i used it maybe times broke on the rd bottle i opened only a month after buying it the cork is jammed up inside the mechanism so badly we can't fix it won't let us return it very cheap and poorly made i have no idea how to use this thing and neither does any of my friends year old graduate students we cannot figure out how to get the cork off after it removed it from the bottle besides patiently unscrewing the cork back off the second time i used it the cork wouldn't come out of the opener i previously had the same opener but after a year the same thing happened i loved the way it opened bottles effortlessly but it's very flimsy i guess i need to look for a better quality one there is only a day return period so i guess i'm out of luck cork stuck the first time we used it cannot remove the cork need a return it is temperamental doesn't like synthetic corks and does not pull the cork out completely so you still have to wiggle the cork out i would not buy this as a gift for anyone nor will i purchase another when this one gives up the ghost it broke after a year this is my nd one first one was great this one is noisier and does not seem it has as much power they are great for arthritic hands last one was great this one less so sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't i am going to buy another one though very disjointed with this wine opener it's stopped working within one month of purchasing it broke before it even opened a bottle of wine junk will be returning it worked twice and now the stupid thing won't charge waste of money ordered this november and at months or so later it won't hold enough of a charge to open even one bottle typical chinese lack of quality control and oster not demanding any such quality control i see others on this page have complained about the same problem oster really should replace these items my wife says that she is going to contact them for a replacement good luck with that obviously i am not optimistic that she will even find a way to really get in touch with some one who could make such a decision the batteries should be able to be replaced if they can't get a handle on quality control at the chinese manufacturer i might then give a modest recommendation for the product but as is it is a crap shoot at best roger anderson i really wanted this to work and by reading all the positive reviews i thought this a good buy i tried it on bottles and screw goes in and and comes up with no cork perhaps defective but doesn't do the job did not work as it should have returned it it was working great but it doesn't want to charge or hold one it's like the battery drains in a second on the first bottle you try and open bought this as a replacement for one that had worn out it is a very value level opener it works fine but it is lightweight and looks like plastic and feels like plastic it might be great in some places but if you drink wine that costs more that per bottle get a better one than this awful complete waste of money it's screws into the cork but does not pull it out it did not come with the foil cutter as described quit working after a week will not charge has been that way since purchase unfortunate this broke just after the return period ended i guess i'm stuck with it now it only goes up and not down however it never worked very well to begin with do not buy this wine opener the one we had previously worked for years this one has very little power to it i have ordered two of these in the last month and both of them are incapable of holding a charge long enough to open even one bottle of wine i ordered this because my brother has owned one for years and i love using it when visiting unfortunately i am not having the same luck and no idea why maybe i'm dumb but it always gives me trouble a friend has the same one and also dislikes it i wanted to be fancy but i should have just bought an old fashioned wine opener you really have to get the hang of it plastic housing likes to crack open at the base if the cork is especially stubborn and the opener becomes slightly canted two starts for the clear need to use a metal base that being said those splits have yet to actually damage the plastic it just snaps back into place i purchased this product months ago and it is no longer working i open approx bottles per month that would mean after opening bottles it no longer worked very disappointed does not work on plastic corks difficult to use i like how the unit works but eventually the rechargeable battery will die upon opening up the unit i discover that the battery pack is proprietary and hard soldered no replacement is available so if you purchase one consider it disposable i have seen reviews where it dies in months and some say it lasts a year or longer even when mine was new it struggled to remove some corks the unit needs to be more powerful stopped working after weeks not that amazing overkill for what it really does the openers with the screw and arms work better and are cheaper this one can get the cork out part way with a couple of rounds then i have to yank the rest out manually i used to have for years the electric wine opener from wine enthusiastic which is great by the way and wanted to buy another one and decided to go for this it is a terrible product the charge doesn't last at all and i used it like times and is not working already dont' recomend this product wanted to return it but don't seem to have that option anymore didn't work as well as we had hoped dont purchase doesn't pull cork out all the way but does get it started i love the opener i rated it a because the battery has gone bad you must now keep it plugged in at all times once you take it off the charger and use it one time the battery is drained and it must be charged again this product only lasted a couple of months before breaking absolutely terrible i have had more trouble with this wine opener it just does not work it has pushed the cork down inside the bottle i ended up slicing my finger trying to remove it does the light turn 'green' once it's charged i have fibromyalgia and it is difficult for me to grip and open bottles cans etc thought this would be a great buy and assist in that process turned out to be a real disappointment if anyone has a suggestion for how to get this thing to work i would greatly appreciate it it worked for about a year and then a cork got stuck it wouldn't recharge the foil cutter was missing the metal that actually cuts the foil dead after year which i guess is okay if you don't mind buying a new one every year but i prefer to have something a little longer lasting you get what you pay for after year the power is only good for open one bottle of wine had product for months and already broken it will not open a bottle just release the cork cheap and also cheap i gave this item my recipient reached out to me and said it stopped working i gave it as a gift i was very sad it's too late to replace really purchased this item in february and used it once went to use it a second time and it will not work amazon will not accept return or exchange because it is past the return window save your money works well but difficult to use as you cannot see what's happening on other brands models the plastic over the corkscrew is see through which makes it easier to use you can ensure the screw goes into the middle of the cork as well as easily tell when it's pulled it out all the way this model you can't see anything so it's more difficult this item was falsely represented as having a list price of on the oster website it is listed with an msrp of only i bought it on april th and it had stopped charging properly by mid june and does not work at all now i tried to return it to amazon today but was told that it could not be returned any later than days after purchase even though it is defective this product never charged i travel a lot and didnt realize it until it was too late to return it update it broke after months after light usage we don't drink wine at home all that often used it to open less than bottles of wine in months but it broke down recently the screwing mechanism stopped working nothing happens when we push the down button pretty disappointed would really love it to work well such a great concept best product i've bought to date every wine lover should own one of these no more broken wine cork stuck in bottles no more struggles trying to twist the cork screw into the cork this takes less than a minute and pressing a button to automatically screw into the cork and extract out the cork from the bottle the handy foil cutter that comes along with purchase was great too after using this i bought other of this electric wine opener one for my best friend and one for my dad i bought it because my dearest friend bought it and loves it with mine the bottom button works efficiently going into the cork but then it never releases the cork no matter how long i hole down the top button what a disappointment what a waste of money i've only had this item no more than months and it has stopped working very disappointed in it found it difficult to use but once i got the hang of it it worked wonderfully i had this item for just over days and it started smoking it's over days since i purchased it so i can't return it even though it's defective in the beginning it was a great buy but after couple months it started to acting up i thought it was only mine that broke down but after reading these reviews i noticed i wasn't the only one i opens half way it distroys the cork while taking it out i have to try the old school one knife to remove the rest i used to save corks for future dyi project but after having this opener i should just say good bye to that doesn't work followed the instructions but it still did not fully remove the cork i had to use a manual wine opener to remove the rest of the cork horrible product it only removes the cork half way my husband and i both tried to use this item several times unfortunately i cannot return it because the window closed buyer beware total waste of money it does not go in deep enough to remove cork a complete waste of money we previously had this item for years that one finally died so we replaced it with this one it died within a few weeks of owning it i didn't get around to returning it in the time allowed on amazon and now we're stuck with something that just does not work super bummed and not sure if it was just faulty or if the product wasn't as good as it previously was i am writing review late because i had forgotten about it and should have returned this item but my wife put it in the garage this device maybe opened bottles and then would never recharge it may be that it never did and that we were using the original charge anyway did not work for us if the cork was half the size this would work well i have tried it three times and each time the cork only comes half way out continued attempts only cause the cork to crumble i have to resort to my old hand corkscrew to finish opening the bottle flimsy control button which easily can break but good design and well thought out works good i read the included booklets multiple times watched youtube videos but i still can't get this to work i'm hoping it's just operator error and i will update this review if i can get it to work gave as a gift she loves it very disappointed not powerful at all it takes multiple times to even pull the cork up enough to where i then have to pull it out myself it does not have the power to open some of the bottles of wine we have purchased it shipped quickly delivered on worked well for months became sluggish stopped working may th what a horrible buy it replaced a waring pro that i had for years i really liked this thing i have arthritis and this makes my life so much easier when opening wine for my wife and family at dinner sometimes those rubber plastic coorks get stuck but mostly it works perfectly so my only complaint is after four years the battery is starting to fail it will barely open one wine bottle before i have to charge it and it's seems really anemic and that wouldn't be an issue except i cant change the batteries they are completely sealed so there's no way to change them out failed sent it back a little hard to use a piece of crap broke within a week it will not work it only goes up not down may i please return it concept is great i was so excited to try this i've tried it times still had to get my old fashion one out took me minutes longer than it should to get my wine open was shipped in pieces not assembled so much for the inspection stamp this product i am sure works great but it di not standout like the magic decantor that has a cool led light feature this was a christmas present for my wife dec and here it is the end of may and the thing won't hold a charge it won't open bottles can't be charged too light to be a doorstop it's useless can't get cork out of bottle with this thing stick to old school one we have had this for about months and have opened about bottles of wine then it broke and will not work bottles very disappointed in the quality of this product i should say don't buy it but i'm not that kind of person make your own choice we may have gotten a bad one who knows i tried calling and had no luck with the company wow opener needs recharging after only bottle openings i have had it 'die' right in the middle of removing a cork then i am stuck with a mess not nearly as good as the prior one made by a different manufacturer that we got as a gift i had to change my review here i bought this product in may and it already is a lemon which is a polite way to put it it worked well enough for about six weeks but now refuses to open bottles i say this meaning when you press the down button which pulls out the cork nothing happens no sound no motion no nothing i have this thing fully charged too i contacted the seller and requested a replacement and have heard radio silence from them we owned this same product for two years before we bought this one this one didn't last three months and was only used a few times contacting vendor to see if we can get it replaced im not understanding why this works only some what the cork gets stuck inside and don't want to come out i have stick my finger inside to make the cork retract out did not last purchased in february of and it is now the end of may has died and will not work has been plugged in continuously since purchase the previous wine opener we had lasted for years would not recommend good this opener is terrible in comparison to two others i bought that work great useless there goes my money useless tool doesn't remove the cork properly only about half way very disappointed help am i doing something wrong we have keep using the up and down switch at least five or six times to extract the cork it is a real struggle but i'm hoping i'm doing something wrong doesn't work as well as i thought it would when it comes to opening wine but maybe it's mostly user error on my part i never did have the best of luck with wine corks no matter what kind of opener i use i'm sad it's broken after about weeks of use it no longer unscrews to release the cork i hate this thing it's more work than just using a corkscrew it doesn't remove the corks you have to yank the cork and the machine out of the bottle this seemed like the dream opener when you first get it then it broke after like months so i thought maybe it was us i bought another one and the same thing happened they just do not last the electric wine bottle opener was a let down i struggled to get the cork out the bottle once the opener pulled the cork half way out i also had to insert the opener onto the cork to try ti get it to catchthe cork to pulled it out i ordered the rabbit cork screw and i love it this is the second one i have purchased however this last purchase on march th no longer works very disappointed i have only had the opener for weeks it's not working had one before which lasted years now i can't return because it's over days stopped working after only a month conveniently the return window has now expired it's all good back to a regular cork screw i have had this opener for about a month and have attempted to open maybe bottles this opener has not successfully completely removed a single cork at best it gets them halfway allowing me to pull it the rest of the way out with pliers it does not matter if it is a synthetic cork or an actual cork one it fails every time it also does not appear to be user error as two friends have also used it without success it is a nice little opener it does not come with directions i left it in its charger maybe i should not have but again it did not come with directions now it is not charging even though will by a replacement hard to use and had on numerous occasions to just chew up the cork and not remove had to revert to old leverage opener to remove would not buy again and outside return window by days returned didn't work having a problem removing corks that was the only reason to purchase this wine bottle opener i am very unhappy this product bought in jan went out may it died on i would never buy it again it worked great for about weeks and now it is broken we probably only used it times does not remove the cork out of bottle it breaks the cork up into pieces arrived broken and i have never been able to use this wasted my money very cheap in it's operation kinda sounds like it might not get the cork out we are on our second one didn't realize until other friends recognized it and advised theirs broke also the switch worked on bottles before it stopped working and it's unusually tall and awkward and the charge light never goes out so you have to take it out of the stand to turn the lights out i wouldn't buy it again actually thinking of returning it lasted months and died you can press reverse and remove a cork from the unit but the button to remove a cork from the bottle does nothing won't buy again i bought this on christmas and it lasted till christmas the battery does not charge enough for it to open a single bottle in one year and to think that i expected it to last for years poor quality i loved mine but it didn't last over a year it stopped charging all the way and didn't have enough power to screw into the cork not so much i've tried it times down and up not out the last time that i tried to remove a cork it broke off and i had to get out a kitchen knife not once did it remove the cork on once or two sometimes three tries i don't recommend this product at all after uses it just stopped working i always had it charged too it was such a disappointment but now i always just use a regular wine opener nothing like trusting your own two hands i bought this to replaced a five year old opener different brand and it simply does not work it isn't powerful enough to extract most corks i'm surprised by some of the other reviews which give it raves they must be fake don't waste your money this is the second oster cordless electric wine bottle opener i've purchased each lasts approximately a year and then stops mine stopped charging after months lasted weeks horrible gave as a gift product failed shortly after don't waste your money on this product used less than a dozen times and then broke it was out of the day return window so i can't even return stay away it doesn't even work piece of junk we have tried to open three bottles of wine with this to no avail this is a waste of money worked fine on the first bottle i opened then totally crashed on the second bottle unfortunately a bottle of chardonnay had to dig the cork out and found much of the cork in my glass totally sucks bought in july doesn't work anymore i guess quality is worth the price not recommended this product doesn't seem to fully charge outside of that itt works ok but you have to have it perfectly aligned bought this product months ago and it has just quit working loved it when i first got it because t disappointed it didn't even last one year got this for my mom for christmas and went to visit her and found out the carger won't work so it has no power and can't send back now because it's to late purchased in january not working in march no customer service whatsoever would not grab and hold cork well returned it i have had a hard time getting the cork to come back out every time sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't i previously had a rabbit cordless bottle opener and feel it worked much more consistently only used the opener about times and has stopped working the up button works but not the down which is what opens the bottle would not recommend was good while it worked but should have lasted more than months we've had this opener since the beginning of february and it just stopped working it will put the screw into the cork but it won't pull the cork out this is the second one we've owned i did not seat the first one well while opening a bottle and broke the plastic housing very little metal in this product mostly plastic doesn't work tried on about dozen bottles and cork barely comes out and damaged still using old school tool that still over works this item you have use it a couple of times before opening a bottle not so satisfied with the product awful doesn't work on any kind of cork it stopped working altogether within a few months i had to give this one star to write a review i am really disappointed in this product i don't think it's rocket science or anything but i have yet to get a cork out of a bottle of wine with this thing it does not work great concept but mine broke with the first use only lasted a month worked great at first looks nice after than having this for only a few minutes doesn't work anymore at all poor quality after a few successful uses a cork got stuck and the opener was broken into pieces see picture i knew perfectly how to use it it was not bad use or abuse the product is of very very bad quality do not buy it it wokrs perfectly but the plastics and detailsof the product look and feel cheap the charging light on top never goes off even if it is already charged booooo this wine opener is not all that easy to use but it got the job done for the first five bottles then just outside the return window it stopped working the screw goes down about inches and then the motor turns off if you push the up arrow the corkscrew withdraws but of course leaves the cork in the bottle tried three times on different bottles waste of money worked once hasn't worked since broken in about two months mechanically it works fine the problem is that many wine bottlers not just the cheap ones are switching to a synthetic cork which this bottle opener will not work with this lasted about two months then refused to pull corks it is plastic and does not feel sturdy and failed after opening maybe bottles lasted about a month before it broke stopped working after about a month i ordered this a couple of months ago because the one i had for almost years was giving out i'd been so happy with my first one this i've used several times now and only once have i not had to dig the cork back out of the opener most of the time i have to use force even to get the cork out of the wine bottle i looked for a way to contact the seller but i've found none hopefully this review will catch someone's attention and they can help me with the situation so buyer beware and use immediately after purchasing because the return window closes a month later not that impressed i have now used this for nine months and it has now stopped working it will no longer take a charge very difficult to actually get the cork out got it as a christmas present worked great for about a year and then just died unit has stopped working it works half way in through the cork and stop very upset and disappointed don't waist your money on this this is not working at all the first time i used this it chewed up the cork then a big piece got stuck inside i tried to take it apart to get the cork out but as soon as i pulled the back off pieces started falling out and i had no way of knowing how they fit back together unfortunately i don't have the paperwork or packing any longer so can't return it this item is garbage i got it last saturday and it broke today tuesday it works very well until the day a cork gets stuck it will not go back to be the same broke within months can't return after days don't buy product broke after first use i hadn't used it right away and it was too late to return it waste of money it broke already buttons dont work half the time didn't work when i got it stopped working after months use have purchased this same opener in the past for presents and they seem to still be working doesn't hold charge must be in stand constantly stopped charging after weeks i purchased this on jan it had a lot of power in the beginning on march th it would not screw into the bottle the top button to unscrew from the cork and release worked fine it appeared to be charging fine i called amazon and i was over days but they offered to send a replacement or refund it i chose the refund and will go back for the rabbit received this as a gift unfortunately the down button did not work i returned it for a refund and ordered another the replacement also did not work ac adapter did not work there was something physically broken inside it rattling around very poor quality the item opened one bottle of wine and does not work i have had the same unit for three yearsand when it failed i ordered a new one this one doesn't work and i would like to know how to return it for a new one it is not working well oster sent me another and it has just arrived there is no charging cord and it doesn't work either worked beautifully for months then broke on the good side it's easy to open a bottle of wine and the foil cutter is great one of the best i've owned not so good as expected the charging light comes on when you plug it in but it never turns green or goes out just gets dim so i don't know whether it's fully charged or not and like so many products the instructions are minimal so i don't know if this is normal the opener seems to struggle and almost stall when working on a tough cork i give it a pep talk and so far it always manages to get the cork out but i keep my folding manual opener handy just in case and i kept the box in case i have to return it product works poorly for me the screw tends to come out of the cork many times and is also big and bulky compared to others my biggest disappointment with this was the packaging i bought it to put in a gift basket i was making for a silent auction and i was unhappy to have it arrive in an ugly plain cardboard box not the oster packaging i was expecting so if the packaging matters to you for gift giving or anything beware the product itself looked kind of cheap i can't comment on it's performance this thing doesn't work at all i've tried it several times fully charged so has my husband screws into the cork but doesn't pull it out waste of money worthless from the beginning it would not charge and it never has worked literally the nd bottle that was opened with this thing it stopped working and was completely dead tried recharging it thinking maybe it was just out of juice even though it was left on the charger all of the time like the instructions say to the light comes on but when you push the button it doesn't do anything it doesn't even make a sound like it's trying to do anything save up the money to get yourself a rabbit opener my foil cutter arrived with no blades i am unable to use this foil cutter i gave this to my dad for christmas and it already stopped working ridiculous when i received this opener i was impressed by its looks for about weeks it worked beautifully then it would not hold a charge well i'm guessing that was the problem it would lift about of the cork from the bottle then stop working so i thought perhaps my husband had not charged it the last time he used it i plugged in the charger let the opener charge overnight the next evening the same thing happened it pull not lift the cork from the bottle i should have returned it but i just put it in the garbage because it was garbage i would not recommend this electric wine opener is incapable of removing the cork we have tried this times on different bottles of wine and it does not work i used this wine opener times now and only time did it fully bring out the cork if you don't pay close enough attention just as i did and you do a small honest mistake such as putting the wrong screw into the wrong hole it never comes out i tried every which way to fix such a small error but it cannot be reversed i do not recommend only fits a narrow door frame my mansion only has wide door frames i purchased this to use for pull ups and chin ups it does not work in any of my doorways i do have an older house built in the s this just broke while my year old was using it super dangerous easy to put together however did not fit any of my doorways i kept it to do push ups but i really wanted it for pull ups product came with screws that were not long enough for assembly found other reviews with the same complaint they sent me a lemon put it all together get to the last screw and it s damaged and unusable call the number in packaging and it rings to voicemail without any comments no idea if legit number or not no call back yet have no choice but to take it back apart and return too bad simple remedy would be to send me a new screw came with wrong parts twice and nothing was don t to fix it package only received screws for assembly but the manual states that it requires been trying to contact the seller it broke after one use and now i have a broken product not good at all i tried taking out one of the screws because i used to wrong one and now the whole thing is broken i bought this as a christmas gift for my daughter in law she just told me it has already broken this girl weighs less than pounds it must be pretty pitifully made to have broken so easily and quickly good product but it s damages your doorway seemed like a great concept pull up that doesn't secure to the wall that you can remove and use in different ways i used it few a few days and everything was working great until just now after a few sets when it fell from the door and i came down crashing onto my knees i will be returning this asap the product worked great for a few month then started to bend at the bottom bar it also stained the wall so i had to put tape where it made contact for the price its ok didn t come with parts to put it together putting this together is a pain the butt i bought this around weeks ago and just got around to putting it together my boyfriend and i can't even disassemble the parts we tried to put together because they are made so cheaply not satisfied with this purchase so far so good but i haven't used it extensively there's now a little horizontal play in the center joint but no vertical play yet which is more important it does no fit in my doorway good for pushups gave me the wrong sized screws i was never able to assemble it waist of money and time dangerous product do not use shipping was fast but the bar at the bottom does not for together i have tried calling a few times but have not gotten a response package was destroyed missing medium bolts so can t put it together need more overlap in center bar it bends if the wall thickness is bigger impossible to install the locations of the grips are not right for me i either have to go really wide or really narrow unless i use the neutral grip handles which are just the right width for my shoulders i'm a ' woman otherwise happy with the product foam padding is starting to rip everything looked great that is until the assembly began first note that i didn t not use the cheap wrench that supplied i consider myself a very hand person and i used the correct socket size i placed the bolt through the bar and connected to the plastic bar the you place on the door this is where it all goes downhill even though the bolts had a square notch that seats into the plastic bar it is weak and will not hold the bolt when you begin to tighten it so basically it just keeps spinning and eventually rounds the plastic hole needles to say i was pretty disappointed and i have ordered a different brand that will hopefully be more robust than this bar half a star for trying but this is going back i had an iron gym years ago in a different home used it all the time and loved it i rate this one that i just purchased only one star because it doesn't fit the doors in my new home and the description doesn't address door thickness the description states it is designed to fit residential doorways to inches wide with doorway trim or molding up to inches wide my door is inches wide and my molding is inches wide it should also specify that it will not safely fit doorways greater than a certain thickness every doorway in my house including the molding thickness is inches thick at this thickness and with my molding width the plastic bar barely squeezes onto the molding and hangs halfway off to be fair if i put weight on the iron gym the pressure pushes the bar further onto the frame however i just don't feel safe using it in this situation doesn't work if the wall and door frame is too thick total waste of money the wrong size bolts were sent so i can't even put it together instructions weren't very clear where exactly do i use regular washers and where do i use the spring ones but it doesn't matter because the bolts aren't long enough to go through and the holes in the bar are drilled in the wrong place if you screw the pieces together the holes don't line up to attach it total junk bolts are square and holes are round can't even assemble the thing i received this item with no bolts what do you want to do with this the package looked as if it was torn apart and taped back together this does not work in older doorframes or narrow hallways it was too wide to fit in the hallway for the door i panned to use it in and not tall enough to reach around and over the board at the top of the door otherwise once installed in a suitable door it works well frustrating ordered this first time abd bolts dont fit in the hole thats on the bar to assemble bolts are square and hole is round exchanged for another one same thing what a waste of time the straight bar only comes in two pieces and does not lock securely item came with broken screws and is not sturdy major safety hazard they don t offer any way to get the screws the only options i have is to pay for return shipping to get it replaced unable to use as it is too small for any of our doorways definitely measure your doorways before purchasing received this item new in box and it is missing sets of screws washers nuts i cannot assemble it without the missing parts this is missing the support bar that goes against the wall don t buy this used i only received two screws and cannot use mine at all i ordered this pull up bar and it was sent to me missing key pieces and broken pieces they left out one of the long bolts and the plastic ring was cracked i went to the store to get new bolts to try it and when i did the entire thing broke into five pieces everything came apart resulting with me falling and with broken stock pieces it works but the part that presses on your door is hard edgy plastic it dents the door frame so much that the paint rips off when you take it down i love the product but it was supposed to have an instructional work out video included and it was not i would give the actual product stars but since everything is not in the package it will be more difficult to use it safely the middle doesn't connect properly comes apart if you are doing close grip pull ups we have an older home with very deep doorframes this product just wouldn't fit and we had to return it i m sure the product would have worked well for my needs but i didn t have a doorway in my garage that would fit it i didn t want to have to use it in the main house plastic ring that fits inside the two connecting bars was missing i didn't return it because i thought i could find one at the hardware store but was unsuccessful i'm too afraid to use it for fear it won't hold the screws don't even serve why they send staff that not work defective won't hang in our door frame moldings already threw out box threw in garbage i thought the measurements were correct when i bought this but the frame at the top of my door is too wide i wonder if this company sells an extensions or longer curved bars so that i can use this product without having to send it back the small metal bracket that holds the bar to the door frame broken within the first hours of having the bar assembled now it's unusable enjoyed if for the first hours now just disappointed the bars did not fit well and moves every time i try to grip it very unsatisfied with the product decent pullup bar but the plastic on the handles pulls up the paint on the door frame i should've picked a model that protects the door frame instead but for the price this one is fine if the door frame isn't a concern i read the reviews and thought this might be a great addition for my morning work outs i assembled it as instructed and placed the wedge on the correct side of the frame the bars are not flush and noticebly off when trying to seat the flat side aginst the frame one side is braced and the other not sitting flat in trying to adjust it the flimsy wedge broke and i am at my wits end to figure it out i can t so next step is to call the service number included in the package and i was sent to voicemail with a full mailbox the is no way i am putting my full weight on that thing as is and i did not purchase it to do floor exercises didn't fit over my doorway it doesn't fit to our any of our doors like it says door frames are a little wide the bars wouldn't hold i wanted to return it but taking it apart is a bit of a pain the bars are too short for the doorway and the dimensions described fit the dimensions of my door so that was frustrating to discover also the little piece of metal to hold the bar in place is extremely flimsy i can bend it with fingers disappointed i have thick moulding in my door frames and this doesn't really fit the top doesn't reach the top lip of moulding no fault of product my son wanted this product so i purchased it and on christmas when we put it together and put it over the door frame look what broke when he tried his first pull up ugh does not fit any of my doorways of my house it came without all of the screws i can t use this product without all the required parts now i have a very sad daughter on christmas morning didn't fit most doors in my apartment just installed and tested this out surprisingly firm and sturdy have not put it through the paces yet the only big but is that what they call the safety clip is a thin skimpy piece of metal you can bend with your hand even more interesting is that it doesn t seem to actually serve much of a purpose this cheaply made safety clip with no real function is the reason for only stars it's not what i expected it does not fit my door frames this is probably an ok product for a basic door frame the product felt sturdy on the ground however i have upgraded inch door trim so this bar won t sit high enough on it so therefor it doesn t fit the description really should put this in bold and save the seller a bunch of return shipping costs the original door frames in my house from the s are wide the iron gym workout bar is about inch too short to reach the top of the door frame and therefore is unusable contemporary door frames tend to be to wide did not fit in the doorways i have not as sturdy as i'd hoped was an 'as seen on tv's product brought to a friend's house and it fit their doorway so was able to actually try it overall too expensive for what you get works fine for the other exercises you can do with it but mainly wanted it for the pull ups it was defected arrived missing one of the necessary long bolts and the plastic ring can't use it until it's fully assembled so the individual components seem sturdy i'm hoping i don't have to return the whole thing for the sake of two minuscule bits of hardware missing screws and i can't even assemble it now i have to go to the hardware store or return it and get a replacement what a waste of time it works but does not sit securely need tp rolls to prop into proper position package came with missing two major parts very disappointed it fits our door perfectly it works ok but the grips are thin and not very durable supports a lb person but with some deflection i wouldn't recommend for anyone over lbs does not work if you door trims are too small or not sturdy enough to hold it and you can't weight too much to use this either or boom product arrived missing parts couldn't even assemble it returned came in with a strong smell returned not easy to install on the door frame without damaging it total waste of money nuts and bolts to put it together don't even fit the box says there is a free offer for abs straps but there is nothing in the box that allow you to order it this product is violating truth in advertising i put it up in my office works great or rather worked great until weeks ago when it fell off and i broke my fibula now i'm in a boot for weeks the product looks used with missing bolts rendering it quite useless not fit in doorway like stated well the only piece made of plastic broke when i was trying to assemble it so it is hard to review it when i can't put it together not very happy at this point foam rips at pressure point where in contact with the door within one week ruins your door jams oh they have padding but still makes dents in woodwork the metal clip used to hold it in the door frame snapped off after only using it for a few weeks i weigh lbs so i guess this is made for children to do pull ups on this seems to be a decent product except for a major flaw that i anticipate will drastically shorten it's life the long bar that crosses the doorway is two separate pieces that fit together in the center they don't fit tightly i've tried altering the bolts of the cross pieces to get a better fit without success the metal ends only overlap by about an inch and there is bend as you put weight on the bar once i realized this was an issue i looked more carefully and saw that other bars have bolts to hold the middle pieces together i think that would make the whole device safer and that you should definitely look for a bar with these center bolts maybe i can find a metal bar to fit inside the center pieces for added stability or drill my own bolt holes do not buy this item the middle bar that you re putting all your weight on twists together but isn t secure enough took it out the box and there s a plastic ring that was torn how is that supposed to hold me every time i tightened it it would come apart i got of the way done but when i got to the point where you attach the long bar to the u shaped bar the screw holes were the wrong shape the screws did not fit at all i m super disappointed but have to return this and purchase a different brand preferably in a store won't work on any if my door frame because they are neither wide nor sturdy enough missing parts does not fit to my door frame not as adaptable as it promoted it does not hold on the door if it does it is very unstable and can be very dangerous i just opened it and i found it missed two screw and it turned the whole product a trash i was not able to return it and this was my worst amazon experience ever the screws were small please send me the right size easy to put together way too small for my door though but can be used for other exercises besides pull ups it works as described but leaves marks on door frames missing screws how am i supposed to use this it says it comes with screws and i got nothing received bars but did not receive the screws to put the bars together why i mean how so so product the piece of junk came with the wrong size screws so i had to return it waste of time and money very basic construction and the doorframe support bolt started pulling out of the laminate plastic and looking like an injury america's funniest home videos waiting to happen after week of use i weigh lbs but i would expect a bit more from something this highly rated on amazon needed to return not deep enough didn't fit any of my doors and if you have any coving etc on top it doesn't work either came missing two bolts i can't use it smh bought this and was missing two screws i don't know where i can find these screws so i guess the product is now useless to me poor quality not happy with it at all the plastic bar was bent and instead of having bolts in total i only got plus the bolts don t even tighten properly it s all loose and everything and not safe to use some of the bolts weren t even long enough to screw in either if everything was all nice and tighty then this would be a good product also it d be nice to not have a bent plastic bar and to have all the bolts none of this stuff was right at all terrible terrible materials for putting the product together the product itself may be fantastic but if you can't even properly complete the assembly process then it's useless what should be the easiest assembly has wrong parts for doing so as a result of not being able to properly tighten the bolts provide the wall protecting plastic bar is made of poor material in which the bolts easily stripped the plastic when trying to even loosely tighten it on top of that there's no way of reversing the bolt tightening process i was going to switch out the bolts for personal ones that contain a screwdriver access head so that you can hold the bolt in place on one end while tightening on the other the ones provided don't allow for that but as a result of not having that i can't switch out the bolt this leaves me with a loose dangling arm which basically means that i can't use the product not sure of anyone had this same experience but i would suggest that iron gym switch out some of its assembly parts for more logical and sturdy materials unfortunate bc i was looking forward to using this and now i can't even return this product for a refund the rubber on the handles came off after using it barely for months i can't safely use it as i can't hold the handles without the rubber sad to write this review but i have no choice but to give it a star took almost a week longer than promised to ship and it doesn't have the screws included to put it together what a waste of time missing screws provided screws are not long enough this isn't even good enough quality to qualify as a counterfeit avoid at all costs it is very dangerous i advised everyone to not buy it did not work with my door frame but my brother is loving it the medium bolts are too short so i have to go to a hardware store to get the right length the medium bolts don't fit through the plastic bar and curved bars this didn't come with instructions or the correct screw size so now i can't even put it together the foam grips tore within a few uses i sent it back and they replaced it no questions asked which i appreciate but the new one is tearing also i had to put hockey tape around the grips to prevent further tearing once it was put together and held in place i noticed that the bar with the rubber strip that goes against the wall was not straight or even one side touched the wall the the other did not it looked uneven and would not stay in place on any of my doorways tried to return it but i cannot money wasted screws not long enough could not assemble i have no idea how good it is i put the wrong bolt in because the directions suck and i didn't see that there were four bolts in the box now i can't get it out check out my video doesn't fit older home door frames it didn't come with the screws so i don't know if it's good cause i can't even put together the plastic piece on the top that ties the x l shaped pieces have square holes in them to hold the square nuts but are not robust enough which causes the nut to freely rotate when the plastic square hole is eaten up i had to purchase additional hardware from the hardware store to make it work regardless product still serves its purpose the bars don't slot together correctly probably because the machining tolerances were off product came in sealed box but are missing two medium boots needed to assemble the pieces that came with the product do not fit into the holes does the job cheap material i doubt it'll last forever but at least it's light came with two missing screws bolts so had to dig through my tool box in order to finish assembly does not go on most doors missing two screws very annoying otherwise i'm sure once i get them will be fine not good for hanging on a doorframe disappointed did not fit any door ways or stay up in a trailer this device is too narrow to do pull ups for an adult male its works nice for hanging and stretching your back i really wanted this product however i wasn t able to assemble it because two screws were missing i had to go to home depot and buy the screws on my own i find it really annoying that i paid for an incomplete product not happy it wouldn't grip onto my door frame but i still use it to do sit ups and pushups from the floor had to take it apart and adjust it to get it to work on most door frames this works but it doesn't clearly say what size molding it is looking for to work well in doorways i own an old victorian house and the wood moldings trim around the doorways is wider than today's small standard size i have a single doorway where it works but that location isn't very good so it doesn't get used as much as i'd like i'm constantly forced to put it up and take it down other than that it works well feels solid i received this pretty early and the package was just fine i'm only giving this a two star because once i opened everything to put it together i realized there were only two of the locking nuts and spring washers there's supposed to be four with that being said i can't use the thing at all one of the foam padding wraps the rightmost on the pullup bar is not fixed and rotates around the bar when doing exercises for a pull up it is at least a big annoyance and inconvenience for high leg raises i feel it may be a safety issue does not fit the mouldings in my house completely missing a screw and nut which is pretty crucial for something like this did not come with the dvd work out that the box says it comes with or the abs strap very dissapointed but other than that its a good and easy to set up padding for door mars up trim but other then that its a good product i didn't receive all the parts needed for assembly i only have pieces in total two large screws the door attachment two spring washers and two locking nuts really disappointing first pull ups and it bent i had to throw it away i weigh lbs received on time and well packed both by vendor and amazon just opened and started to assemble today found no assembly instructions not a big deal and what appears to be only half the necessary mounting hardware bolts nuts and washers since the bolts are unique and web searching indicates no easy way to find replacements this is now a worthless pile of junk did look sturdy enough for what it was supposed to do but that is irrelevant doesn't fit on my door jam could not return did not fit my bathroom door frame and as i live in a studio that's the only place it could have fit but otherwise the product seemed fine not a good product the product came with bolts that were too long and it wouldn't even titan down i'm not even able to use it i have owned this item previously bought from a retailer and liked it however when purchasing this product on amazon prime it has been a different story the package arrived and there was the sound of loose metal parts rattling around open opening the outer box it seemed that this item may have been a returned item once i opened the actually packaging the plastic bag containing the bolts screws and washers had been torn open once i began assembly i realized that the multi tool that is supposed to be included in order to tighten the bolts was missing altogether not the quality i expect from amazon very disappointed missing bolts i'll change this review if i get the missing connectors right now it's worthless without the missing pieces it's alright though it does run the possibility of damaging the upper portion of a doors border with prolonged use missing two of the bolts looks great but missing two screws so unfortunately it's useless can't find any contact info to get the missing pieces there are only two screws in the box it needs did not even come with the correct parts for assembly bolts and washers were loose in container with no nuts to complete assembly waste of time and money in under a year it feels a little flimsy with the screws coming loose did not fit any of my door frames so had to improvise which seemed to defeat the purpose this came out missing some screws and the bar was bent waste of money it was missing bolts for the wall protector this will only stay on the door jam in one position without slipping too bad i can't return this or i would not strong enough the griped riped bout three days after i bought it the product depends a lot on the type of frame its width and sturdiness in my case the frame is beveled and not very sturdy contacted support twice without an answer grips have come unattached to the frame after only months making product basically unusable in pull up position however that's beyond the warranty return date allowable so all i know to do at this point is leave a negative review it would be nice if there was a way to contact the manufacturer will remove update review if this situation can be rectified avoid it dislodges easily the length of the equipment barely matches my door which i think is a standard door great product and easy to set up however i must say that amazon did not provide one of the pieces i needed to be held up on the door frame luckily my father had the piece as a customer i was very annoyed that it did not come with that i wasn't gonna send the whole thing back for one little piece so just be weary about ordering this piece of equipment nuts are not stable and contains missing parts very bad my door bigger than this prouduct i dint like it ugh i measured the doors in my house to make sure this would fit and according to the sizing requirements it would fit in about half the doors in my house however when i assembled it it was clear that it can't fit over anything other than the skinniest flat moulding from the s s i have three styles of moulding around my doors and it doesn't fit over any of them if it doesn't work with standard current moulding it should specify that before you buy it and put it together so cheap so crappy can't even use it don't bother unless your moulding is less than tall and deep my son used this daily for a out months and the bolts starting falling off alright product for what it is assembly instructions were unclear and i accidentally installed one of the longer bolts in the wrong place and was unable to remove it all of the nuts and bolts were missing more than satisfied with this prodct simple product but very effective i recommend without reservation you cant expect anything more from this product great gadget such a big help seems well made but i tried every door in two houses but couldn't get it to fit ensure you have standard doors and trim before ordering when the product arrived it was missing two medium bolts two washers and two locking nuts making the product unusable came missing bolts and washers making this unusable very easy and quick to assemble my one complaint is the bar's configuration doesn't allow for standard slightly outside shoulder width pull ups the options based on how the pads are arranged are chin up neutral grip pullup and super wide grip pullup way too wide for me as a petite female even for a man i think the pullup pads would be spaced too far apart for standard pullups awesome till it bent in the middle i'm ' and lbs and used this thing daily for about three months it's awesome super convenient and seemed to be constructed however over the past month it's starting to bend in the middle now i'm just waiting for my lbs to come crashing down on the floor i think it's because i do a lot of close grip chin ups today i decided to order a different brand of chin up bar don't recommend bolt doesn't fit holes took me a lot of effort to put them together i would give zero stars it did not fit my door although my door jam is bigger than average cheap wouldn' stay up in the doorway sent it back junk long vertical piece that hold parallel pieces is made out of plastic when u assemble it only takes revolutions to destroy the square indention that should hold the nut in place save your money and pass on this once that plastic indention is messed up even mm you have a stupid looking door stopper i doubt it could even do that i got the wrong set of screw to put the bar in one piece other than that it looks good the parts didn't i'm sure the product would work great if they sent you the right parts for it they sent me the wrong bolts so i had to go to the hardware store and try to find something to fit the holes correctly long story short i could not find anything that fits it perfectly so it wobbles when i try to use it on a door huge waste of both time and money this junk didn't even come where the the screws or nuts original box packaging came opened also this is ridiculous i paid dollars for this and i would've expected to get my money's worth horrible do not purchase this workout bar if you have an older home with wide moldings you cannot get this to hang over the door jamb to use for pullups otherwise it seems very well constructed i've owned this bar for about months but i've only been able to use it safely for about four extremely poor construction and the box did not ship with all of the nuts and washers for assembly i understand that this is a cheap option for a pull up bar but you don't have to be so blatant about it i weigh lbs but this bar has permanently deformed and it on the verge of separating in the middle joint where one bar is slid into the other every time i do a pull up it says it's designed for lbs which i'm not close to so either i received a exceptionally out of spec product that slipped through quality assurance or the design is marginal and they should advertise a lower max limit the lbs limit that is specified must be lbf that factors in the additional load on the bar from acceleration and is not based off a lbs individual doing pull ups at a reasonable acceleration regardless this bar is probably fine if you are a person of lighter or average stature lbs or less anything higher and i would suggest you look for a more reliable sturdier pull up bar virtually every major corporation worldwide has blocked their ads from appearing on breitbart but one glaring exception remains amazon one of the bolt won't amd would just keep turning it worked but it rubbed off on my door frame and made me lose some of my deposit this thing slipped off the door and my daughter fell solid sturdy materials but it only fits on of my doorways in my entire house any doorframe that has somewhat larger than normal molding will not fit do not recommend wish i could return this item good enough you get what you pay for should be fine for a kid not a real workout tool listed as fitting inch door frames but i have a inch door frame and it barely is long enough makes me feel uncomfortable using it as it only extends about inch maybe over the frame if it had another inch it would be fine this doesn't fit any door frame in our entire house beware if you have crown molding while i'm sure the product itself works fine i cannot use it i received no hardware so i am unable to put the thing together this doesn't work on doorways with moulding larger than a couple inches i live in an older home with larger moulding around the doorways there's no way to adjust this to make it fit worked very well before the square plastic bar snapped fell backwards and hit my head they don't seem to have a website or any customer service in the usa no way to contact them through amazon that i can see be careful with this product fyi i am well within normal weight range looked sturdy didn't fit any of my doorways so i couldn't use it i have original door frames from in majority of the house tried it in the basement with updated doorways but it didn't fit either due to the door being in the way of the bar all around pretty disappointed i have an older home had to alter my doorway so it would fit wasn't easy i don't recommend this particular bar i was using it a lot the material rubbed off on my door frame leaving two black marks and pealed paint because since most of the material came off the metal was exposed i was able to use it one last time until the top of the door frame ripped off there are not good mechanics in this build doesn't fit my door you have to have a specific door type and or size i feel like it was misleading in the commercials it should have specified this wow this product is terrible the after this product is fully assembled its pretty much a kids item parts screws etc are all very cheap would not recommend to anyone it's wobbly as heck and i could never find a frame that would support the weight in different places i've lived now i gave up with this junky 'as seen on tv' crap and bought a power tower for x the cost and now i can actually do pullups as well as other exercises and i don't have to worry about falling on my a i gave mine away to goodwill this was a waste of time and money feels like i'm going to rip the jamb straight off i have no faith in this product and while it does work it's a little bit like walking on a frozen lake and you're just waiting for the ice to crack i couldn't adjust it on the door it cannot fit properly very bad it has not let me down yet i mean this literally i do not like the flex it gives when i use it mind you i am bought mine in november and used only intermittently the plastic inside the tip broke and projected to the floor head and knee injured the plastic is not durable enough and there is no warning since it is covered by the rubber stopper really should be out of metal extreme caution when using i am going to try to get my money back or return it does not fit doorway frame i bought these to do the body beast workout by beach body they were a pain to assemble and then when i put them on my door and tried to use them it turns out it's too low for me i'm ' and my feet hit the floor when i extend my arms so essentially i'm only able to get a pull up in i've been trying to compensate by bending my knees but it's not all that effective i would have returned this but i through out the box and i need something to do the pull ups on the body beast workout okay product for the money good product awful and unsafe this thing did not actually fit on any of the doors in my apartment despite them being the correct measurement it seems really unsafe even if it did fit because it just does not appear sturdy had this on my christmas list based the average stars out of almost reviews i'm less than impressed overall the quality seems cheap the silicone padding is attached to the plastic brave piece by double sided tape came off the very first time i used it let's see if some gorille super glue works i got this from my mother in law for christmas i was hoping i would be able to burn some extra holiday calories later tonight but i never got past the put it together stage the provided square neck screw chewed right through the cheap plastic bar the first time i tried tightening the nut i guess my sister in law famous raspberry jumbles will have to be burned off with extra sit ups and push ups did not fit around the door jam if your molding is more than inches it will not work we'll have to return it extreamly disappointed does not fit standard doorway fabric also ripped on first attempt to put up merry xmass missing hardware couldn't put it together have to buy the bolts and washers good cheap pullup bar fits well in my door but has left a black mark on the doorframe missing workout video promo code and mail in offer of ab straps this bar won't fit on a single door frame in my house it looks like it would only fit over trim that's about inches wide absolutely useless i received the iron gym and had no difficulty putting it together unfortunately i am unable to use it because all of the doorways in my home have frames that are too deep from front to back i'm bummed it does not fit most doors well with short bar length inches as it claimed it is dangerous for costomers to use it or potential damage door frame minimal touch to door frame sides not safe it would be much safe if it is made at least inches inches the package brochure claimed it incuded a mail in option for longer bar but we could not find it i sent a meesage to the amazon but no one answer over last one week i tried to find a phone number to call amazon it is impossible to find one after examining all internet pages how difficult it is the service should be much improved literally did not fit any door in my barracks the item is not as pictured for the most part it's fine but the pads at the edges of the bar are not foam as pictured they are made of rubber with enough traction to smear off the paint on your door frame i'm doing pull ups with no problem but now i'll have to repaint the door frame at some point comes with two sets of screws that look exactly alike though minor slightly in length i placed the wrong set in wrong place which got the thing completely stuck and rendered it unusable i had to throw it away protective pads deteriorate and flake and cause damage to door frame i bought this product in july of after amazon shipped it to my house i put the box away until last week i finally got a chance to build this pull up bar and to my surprise this product did not come with all of the screws it's missing screws that are necessary to attach the rectangular bar to the handles wish i would have checked to see if everything was included when i received the package the unit is wobbly at best i had ordered two of these and e mailed the manufacturer requesting to be sent an extra set of screws after having moved states and not having them on hand not so much as a response so on top of this being a piece of s their customer service is even worse screws not clearly marked package arrived in bad condition but what i found inside was worse i ordered new product but the one i received was obviously used the box of the product itself had it's bottom torn out there were all kinds of garbage inside used for filling and parts were missing refund requested all four washers that were provided were bent at where they join making them useless one of the screw holes for the top bar that lays on your door frame was supposed to be square so the screw doesn't turn when tighten them but had little notches cut out that made the screw endlessly turn when you tighten it the bar at the bottom had a plastic safety ring you put in between the point where both handles come together broke with almost no tension put on it i honestly can't believe how poorly made this is don't like leaving one star reviews but there were no screws in the packaging checked every inch of it made for a pretty awkward birthday present but the process of returning it is a pretty big hassle not a great purchase the plastic section stuck to the doorframe and was impossible to scrape off dint fit my door it left divots in the door trim otherwise it is stable when attached properly would not recommend did not fit in my door screws were messed up can't even take them off once fixed was not able to return it because it wont fix in the box without taking out the screws total waste of time before purchasing make sure you do a little research on how standard your door frame is i purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend and it does not fit over any of our door frames throughout the house it kind of loses most of it's purpose at this point otherwise the material is fairly good and i would recommend while it was easy to assemble the bar would not fit on my door did not fit any door in my house just didn't fit my door this worked great but i feel that the parts definitely loosen up over time so you have to constantly adjust wish it was a little wider to fit into some of my larger doorways would my measly woman arms benefit from this product the man in the photos seems to have developed a strong upper body from use of this item but the photos suggest that only men could use it what would a woman look like it she used it would she also strengthen her upper body or not because women cannot develop more muscle tone than is needed to carry a casserole into the dining room please advise would love to know what happens if women use this product for now i'll go ahead and purchase a different pull up bar that will help me strengthen my woman arms it is missing the two locking bolts that hold the plastic bar in place pretty useless without them i am very disappointed i was really looking forward to using this it didn't fit my doorway did not receive promo code for trainer video nor did i receive the mail in offer for the ab straps i have the exact same 'iron gym total upper body workout bar' that i purchased several years ago it is very sturdy made of heavy aluminum and did not bend or budge with pull ups from someone weighing over lbs the foam handles were getting worn and so i decided to purchase a new one for myself and one for my children to do pull ups also i ordered the iron gym total upper body workout bar x back in june and was disappointed upon assembly of the first one and performing a set of pull ups it bowed significantly under my weight and my children ranging from lbs could feel it bowing under their weight also having one already in my home i re ordered expecting to get the exact same quality piece of equipment this was not the case and now i have that i cannot use but will continue to use the older version that continues to be rock solid i wish the foam pads along the crossbar extended all the way to the center bars or were movable because the best position for my hands happens to be where there isn't any foam all parts were missing from the package product arrived missing hardware long bolts locking nuts spring washer medium bolts safety wedge hex open wrench as described in the installation pamphlet impossible to utilize without this hardware doesn't fit all door frames if you have a wide wall it will not fit as it is not expandable be careful would not assemble correctly of the washers wouldnt correctly tighten so the entire product was unusable i tried using a screwdriver but that did not work to fix the problem now i am left with the right half of a pull up bar i'm able to do pull ups with this iron gym but i'm afraid the middle piece is going to break any day now thank you for selling me this piece of s equipment i want my money back it does not fit in the standard doorway and if it does you have to jam it the hell in there do not buy anyone very functional once i got it up bolts wouldn't screw all the way on despite multiple wrenches etc i had to go to my local hardware store and purchase new nuts and bolts for didn't fit bent within the first week do not buy terrible quality the only reason i didnt return it is because i was so mad and was tired of wasting time with it after putting it together buy this from another brand in person this is a fake everytime i use it i feel like it may fall appart on me not good for the mind when working out this pull up bar works great and is sturdy but maybe would be better if it had adjustable bars it will only fit in certain doorways so make sure if you only have wide doors to get something wider the padding where the bar touches the door frame broke after a few months of use and when i took the bar off it took some paint off from the door frame well it's a doorway pull bar however within weeks of use the foam handles have starting splitting apart and distinguishing the bar has a troubling amount of flex in the middle i'm worried it might collapse on me while in the midst of a pull up this is the second chin up bar i've owned the first one lasted several years before the grips started to split the bar i bought in march was splitting by july poor quality grips bought for my yr old to get started in working out it is good for the price i have done a few pullups on it but it doesn't feel sturdy enough for lbs did not support my weight please be very careful for the bigger guys for those thaat it worked for god bless you keep going this product was just delivered and i had a very easy time assembling the bars but i had no idea that your door frame had to be a certain size to fit the product why not advertise what size doorframe the iron gym will fit in if the product isnt adjustable doesnt make sense very disappointing since all my doorways in my apartment have inch doorframes plastic part is hollow inside and not durable at all order the item almost two months back but never opened the package went to put it together the other day and i'm missing two screw to put it together item is essentially useless and a waste of money because i cannot attach the lower bar to use it i couldn't even put it together because it was such a piece of junk i couldn't put it together because it wouldn't fit together correctly because the screws wont tighten because its junk i bought it brand new and there was rust inside the metal the box it came in was slightly damaged and not sealed with tape which makes me think it has been used it also smelled strange the center where the bar connects to eachother has a huge gap this means putting any weight on it would snap it in half feels looks like a replica packaging was old and dusty even the inside parts were dirty didn't even come with washers as well terrible piece of junk broke on first use bar bent mid pull up caused me to strain my back been doing pullups for years decided to buy this for home use needless to say it did not meet expectations star is more than enough first the ziploc bag holding the nuts bolts and washers was torn the washers were missing the bolt threads are poorly made so the nut doesn't spin on it piss poor manufacturing will be returned for a competitor brand didn't work very well either this is a cheap knock off or iron gym switched to a cheap manufacturer the manual included has miniqi branding on it and nutrition is misspelled as nutriltion on the front the inside of the bars is rusted the manual says it includes two long and two medium bolts but it includes four of the same length it includes zero of the four washers the plastic end caps fit so loosely that they fall out and most importantly i cannot even assemble the damn thing the bolts have square necks the metal bars have square holes punched into them that the necks are supposed to fit into snugly while you tighten the nuts instead the holes are too big and the bolts spin freely in them so it is impossible to tighten them the hole in the plastic bar striped very easily and it could possibly cause an injury when in use there are a couple of actual problems with this pull up bar the main issue is that the long cross bar is made of pieces that fit together in the middle by sliding together similar to a curtain rod i am a mere lbs and there is noticeable flex at this joint honestly it doesn't really feel very safe the second problem is that on a standard with door frame there is not really very much room for hanging on to the outer grips because half of that grip end up laying just over the trim if you have large hands this could very well be an issue if it weren't for the hassle i would return mine as it is i'll likely end up getting a more robust replacement after a few weeks product should specify about the frame dimensions if you buy this product and have a wide frame on your door then it is useless you can seriously injure yourself with this like the way i did especially when doing push ups as your arms bend to the sides you can really mess up your back bummer i bought this unit and realized the screws are a bit short i managed to get it right but when i went to use it the door frames are to short and falls out debating what to do now whether to screw in a piece of long wood to keep the item from falling off or to return it i rally wanted to item to work on my belly and upper arms chest shoulders this thing will not support its own weight let alone mine the little gizmo that goes on top of the doorframe is really flimsy and the weight of the bar bends it and almost flips it out of the door frame and i hammered it in there the bar is not stable and has almost broken my nose twice unfortunately i waited too long to return it and now it is too late bolts were too short will be returning the bolts provided are too short for the plastic part of the bar i had to buy longer bolts to attach that part after trying to put it together with no luck for about minutes product is decent for the price a little too flexible thought the construction is fairly sturdy the foam bar covers that touch the door frame begin to wear out with little use and leaves marks on the door frame even with occasional use may need to replace at some point soon do not purchase the product is a decent product i purchased one years ago and it was fine i purchased another one last week and the included packet of hardware was missing two bolts that are essential to assembling the product i had a replacement sent and had the same problem so i had to return that as well not sure why this is happening but it's worthless as is and trying to find the exact right bolt in the hardware store isn't worth it didn't come with all the parts so i can't use it works well i can put it fairly easily i've found a number of door frames that don't work though doors near corners might not have enough space for the bar on one side as is the case with my apartment it does lock in nicely if you center it well on your door frame i've never had any doubts about it falling off or falling apart mine is a little flimsy when off the door frame and will get twisted a little this requires some finagling to get it to sit straight on the door but this isn't a big deal and my friend had one too which was rock steady pros easy set up with good instructions sturdy once up on your door frame many grips to choose from can be used for push ups dips and more padded handles give good grip to hold onto cons doesn't work in all door frames might not be super sturdy when not on a door frame it did not fit the frames of the doors in my apartment other than the exit door so i have to use it out there but it works great its very specific to me but i have a house none of my doors accommodate this bar they are all too thick with tall molding so consider that before you buy i had to add an ugly modifcation for when i want to use it the bar is sturdy and assembled easily it fits over my door snug the disappointment i have is one of the black grips around the bar where you hold onto the bar came loose and spins so i'm repeatedly readjusting my hand's grip when the grip on the bar rotates when i'm doing my exercises i'm going to see if there's a way i can glue the grip onto the bar the kicker is that i've had this product in use for just weeks i would not purchase this product again because this problem occurred so quickly after we started using it feels like it's going to fall off the door had to return this item i got this because it's the supposed to be the same as one that my buddy has which is super solid and built great but they seem to have changed the way the middle section links up and after putting mine up and using it i found it feels weaker and bends in the middle a good bit when doing certain pull ups i'm not worried it's going to break because it's rated for a lot of weight but it just feels looks funny and kinda bothers me every time i do pull ups on it as it almost gives the impression it might give in overall it performs well though for the price does not stay hung in the doorway like advertised and is completely unusable it put together easily and as far as chin ups and pull ups is concerned it does the job it was also advertised it could be used as a sit up aid which is technically true but i find the bar tends the slide up the door frame pretty easily however it could just my form being bad so your mileage may vary came in defective couldn't even install the damn thing down the drain doesn't fit any of my doorways not in love with it it only fits my closet door and it kind of damages the wall i wish there was some kind of warning not as advertised kind of flimsy didn't fit in most of my doors which is my fault for not measuring the item that came wasn't the same as the posted pictures it also had signs of usage and wear and tear for a few months probably packaging was mediocre item works as described though that's about all it gets the walls in my house are thick causing the door jambs to be thick causing the plastic part to not be able to reach the jamb on the other side of the door no mention of this in the description which is why i'm rating a pull up bars in general are mediocre sometimes you can't get high enough the materials are not top of the line and unless you permanently install it it'll likely fall or become unstable i used this for a few weeks then gave it away it's just not worth the hassle unless you want to dislodge some door frames i just purchased this product in hope to workout at home when i removed the item from the packing there was nothing but page of instructions to construct the workout bar simple enough insert bolts into locations unfortunately what the packaging left out in the picture only single diagram was that there were two long and short screws after inserting the first screw into place i noticed the handle was loose and would flop around it did not look secure at all so i tried removing the bolt it would not remove i even purchased a professional bolt remover from home depot but since the screw was loose the screw would turn every time the bolt was turned i tried grease pliers everything but no luck now the pieces cannot be assembled or dissembled to be returned back into its original box i was unable to use this product once and extremely frustrated unfortunately we have not even been able to use this it is hard to explain but we live in a large house with large moulding above and around the doors the top part of this bar does not fit over the moulding therefore we can not attach it to any of our door frames we did not return the product because after shipping and repackaging costs it did not seem that we would get any or much of a credit make sure it will fit your day it's ok but a lot smaller that i thought for my doors not at all stable keeps falling off total hazard the holding covers rip off this product has gone down in quality from when it was initially introduced the foam pads have disintegrated and have caused the paint on the woodwork around the door to peel off the pads have completely fallen off i think i might have received a ripoff version the manual is titled ultlmate workout and nutriltion guide the pads also looked a bit worn the hardware also didn't match what was in the diagrams but it has done its job pretty well so far this is the second time i've bought one because the first one broke that's an important thing to make clear it comes with a small metal guard that keeps the workout bar attached to the wall it snapped after three months of occasional use this time i'm going to the hardware store to see if i can get a back up bracket in case it happens again it will work for you but be careful it will not last that long this appears to be a fraudulent product you will notice that the packaging says iron gym but does not have tm the instructions have multiple typographical errors the product was also missing bolts needed for assembly i also tried the product out before realizing that it was a knock off it did not seem to be stable and seemed to be bowing in the middle i'm about pounds don't be duped works great no trouble supporting my lbs two issues wouldn't fit on my doors because they have molding but i expected this going in from reading other reviews and rigged something up second issue is that the soft parts on the side were torn up and left black marks on the jamb i had to fix this by putting little pieces of cloth in between them and the jamb false advertisment it says it comes with free straps and a dvd in front of the box but just the pull up bar comes in there product works great it attaches to the doorframe without any screw or anything the only problem i had with it was that it was missing some screws so i had to go to a hardware store to buy replacement screws doesn't fit all doors none at my home support this we purchased this a while back for our son he still uses it but we have seen better built units the center where they attach tends to sag a bit but has held together well enough to work i was excited to receive my iron gym door frame pull up bar days early however upon putting it together i noticed i was missing on the bolts lock washers and nuts those are very important pieces i was able to find the necessary parts at the local hardware store but i wasn't able to find the most important piece the metal piece that shoves into the doorframe to secure the equipment i am very disappointed with my purchase if i were only using it for pull ups that would be fine but i'm using it as a secure position to strap my yoga inversion swing to it where i will be hanging upside down on top of this the manufacturing and hardware seem very cheap and it certainly is not like the iron gym my brother bought years ago i will definitely be seeking a refund literally broke the third time i used it it left a few marks and an indent on my doorframe approx in wide so i'm hoping that this doesn't come out of my deposit my max weight while using this thing was so that was a disappointing effect also my so has one and the foam on the end of one of the curved bars has torn off finally i don't think that it is very useful for situps but maybe i am just not using it correctly however i am really glad that i bought this leaving it in the door frame is very motivating to do a few pull ups i just think that there could be a few improvements to the design it ruined the wood around my door the padding is not thick enough to stop the end of the metal bar from digging into the wood feels super flimsy the bar is a piece set looks like it's going to bend in the middle where it connects but so far so good wouldn't fit any of my doorways materials are all cheap lots of plastic and weak metals it doesn't fit the doors in my house but i'll still keep it just in case this review is after a very long time frame of having the product i purchased it nearly years ago so can attest to durability as well as any issues that may have surfaced after such an extended period likes it does what it should you easily put it on the door with no screwing or other installations and it just works the bar is reasonably padded and doubling as a pushup bar is a nice bonus so to put it short it does what it does dislikes this wasn't an initial problem but surfaced over the course of years and that is the foam itself it has broken apart in a couple places what has happened is that the force when you do a pullup is transferred almost entirely to the foam pieces along the long bar as they are pushed into the door molding this causes the foam to compress over time and eventually break down the plastic in mine has pushed through the foam and is now in directly contact with the door i would say this happened around year or of owning the product secondly the foam itself stains the doors there are black marks that can not be removed on our white door trim pieces without painting them over the movement caused by the compressed foam has actually worn right through the paint on the door moldings the product is still usable as the foam on the parts in contact with my hands are still fine conclusion so yes it works but not without a drawback that if you value the appearance of our door moldings may be big enough to look elsewhere i can't speak to whether newer versions use different materials but to me the parts that have direct contact with the molding should be made out of a different material i went back and forth between a and star but settled on because its advertised as a door hanging pull up bar and if it can't perform in the one environment it was meant for it shouldn't be rewarded i wouldn't trust this thing plastic cracked while in use i weigh and ' tall too small for my door frames while multiple reviews and the user manual warn that this is only suited for doors up to wide there's some extension bar you can order for wider doors none mentioned that large door frames will also prevent installation my smallest door frames are about wide and i think the unit can just barely be snugly installed at that width it's not even close to possible on my larger wide door frames the height of the door frame's top bar also matters from the flat surface on top of the frame where the unit will rest while installed to the bottom of the top bar the edge the top of the door clears is about vertical inches on my smallest frame this matches the size of the unit so closely that it took some creativity to get the safety wedge installed between the unit and my door frame this is again with a door frame wide and may have a bit of slack for slimmer frames my wider frames not only were too wide to accommodate the unit but also made it clear that vertical height for the top bar of the frame couldn't possibly be cleared even though is just barely possible on my slimmer wide frame a final consideration is that the bar and your pull ups will be on the no hinge no door side of the frame all together this purchase will probably have to be returned and this could have been avoided if these limitations were more clearly posted would not work on door screws are not properly lined up with the product i took min trying to tighten one nut but the thread is horribly off not to mention the low quality wrench is painful tedious to use i'd like to think i got a rare defect but the entire product seems cheap i will be asking for a refund and looking for different brand for my fitness needs not fit on my door this product does not fit in my doorway and now it's useless the description said nothing about the requirements of the doorway and now i'm screwed because i have nowhere to put it don't make the same mistake as me i'm never using amazon again doesn't really stay on door frames very well it's a decent product but mine has seen about month of use and it's already got a pretty decent bend in the middle of the straight part of the bar if you plan on using it frequently and weigh more than lbs i recommend finding a more sturdy product in the first minute of trying the bar the safety wedge completly bent and i cell on my butt did not have door grip middle bar that connects everything keeps coming apart this is a great bar provides good work out however i am giving this a star for lack of safety when you hang this above your door it can easily slip off from the lip of the door frame that is what happened to me actually a few times finally i landed on my pelvic bone and trust me this was not pleasant this gym bar does not provide safe installation option and taking it on and off the door may cause an accident flimsy and feels like it's going to break right in the middle where the base pieces connect i will update if a refund return is offered damages doors materials splits leaves smudges not a good product received this as a gift from my wish list please note that you cannot use it on a door it is too short this is good if you don't weigh much the two tubes that connect in the middle sagged and pulled apart when my plus pound husband tried it missing pieces absolutely fake you will know when you buy this trust me every one holes didn't match never able to use returned as soon as the package arrived i was incredibly pumped to set it up i'm enlisting in the marine corps so i bought this to help me practice pull ups at home as i began assembly i realized that they had not properly displayed the differences between the types of screws so i just grabbed two and plopped them in however as i began screwing them in the plastic grooves in the upper bar quickly wore out and so as i realized my mistake they had actual philip's screws but did not show them on the illustration of how to put it together nor did it say which and so i tried removing them but they could not come out due to the grooves being worn out and so they've been like that and i cannot assemble it did not fit our door frames the foam on the extreme ends breaks down quite fast i got shipped a boot leg piece of junk not a real product and sketchy as all heck works better than other bars because does not need to install and only has joints you need to be carefully because when installing the paint can get peeled unfortunately after having the product for about a week or it left a huge dent in my door frame and took some paint off the rubber or foam pad on the pull up bar completely broke sometime during usage it worked well for the time it was used i can only say it was setup correctly built correctly and used correctly at pounds i was hoping this wouldn't cause any damage i'm a hit disappointed will try again since there is a new distributor listed piece of junk i'm convinced the one i got was counterfeit as the back bar that hangs on the doorframe was hollow plastic buyers beware i've been using this for months and i'm looking for a replacement product nevermind that the dvd and exercise poster were missing it's a cheap piece of crap terrible prodcut paint chipped off comepletly no directions on how to install also is impossible to tighten bolts probably the worst purchase i've ever made on this website pretty terrible design the inch width is a bit too generous and they intentionally try to up sell folks on longer bars instead of making it adjustable would give stars except it leaves marks on the doorway other than missing pieces and wrong instructions or wrong parts the product is seems to be working well so far there were nuts missing so i had to go to the hardware store to get lock nuts that matched the bolts in the instruction sheet said there was supposed to be two different sizes but all four were the same size works as intended unless you have super wide door frames couldn't use mine at all didnt fit moldings ended up returning it build quality wasnt that great either it looks like in the beginning customers received really great versions of this product i would give this stars because i love the concept but the fact that it doesn't feel safe makes it useless why it rates so low putting it together was a doozy the instructions were a simple zoomed out diagram about the size of a postcard poorly printed barely visible and included no written directions does the bar go under or over we figured it out by going online but why should that even be necessary most importantly the material is awful it bends and flexes and makes noise when it does and i'm scared to put all of my weight on it which actually makes this a useless product i am really scared that it won't hold especially with how bad it flexes when you aren't even off the ground yet very scary and when i'm worried about my safety i can't focus on my workout i think like others i must have got a knock off which is pretty sad since i actually ordered it from iron gym's amazon page received a ripoff like many others here it works fine but i would rather have the authentic product considering that's what was advertised on the webpage as some other users noted a counterfeit product was sent to me instead of receiving an iron gym workout bar it's some generic door gym brand the outer box was damaged during shipment not a big deal and the workmanship of the pieces and product itself was poor the tools that came with this didn't fit well so i had to use my own pretty easy to put together but their instruction sheet was essentially worthless i didn't even reference it because the assemble instruction was just a picture of the final product along with some numbers pointing to where to put the screws nuts it said two m mm screws and two m mm screws were included without reference to which was which so i can see some poor soul having trouble telling the difference between the two seeing as how the length differed by a mere mm less than of an inch seems to work fine thus far but i may just go out and buy an authentic one before this falls apart due to shoddy craftsmanship this is not the real iron gym this is a knockoff product seems to work the same but this is not properly advertised bar itself works great though the padding does thin out so i would suggest getting something to add additional padding or get some good gloves not the very best quality it doesn't really fit with normal width door we live in a year old hpuse and the walls are to thick to use this its not the bars fault but then again it is not adjustable i am super excited to try this workout equipment but in my package there was only two long screws and no mid screws needed to put everything together it was very disappointing as i was very excited to try this apparatus only half of the required tools was very disheartening i can't put it together until i return it or i send my boyfriend to home depot to get two midsize screws with two tiny caps and two bolts terrible they give you the wrong bolts to assemble the piece of equipment therefore causing it to break does not fit anything larger than a standard door frame worked fine when i was in a new condo but was not able to use when a moved to a house with walls over thick could not assemble product because bolts provided were incorrect see photos short bolt isn't long enough to assemble product just as so many of the reviewers said that parts were missing this order was missing two short screws since it was sold by amazon i thought amazon surely would have had the manufacturer correct this i was wrong this item should be removed from the amazon site this piece of junk lasted exactly days days after the return window closed poorly made when a lb teenager can slit the bar at the joint does not work on top molding that is inches it s ok didn't fit any door in my apartment as of now it is a glorified push up piece do not buy broke after three uses and iron gym with their day money back gaurentee never once responded to my emails and calls about wanting a replacement unit this is a piece of garbage a truly disposable item there is nothing iron about this i went ahead and purchased the stamina power tower b y suu worth every penny if you can fit it in your house bum part of this deal is the 'standard' width have to retrofit for my standard doors ' anything built in the last years has doors wider than 'standard' and what would it take to simply make these adjustable someone needs to give their design department a heads up this is not an iron gym workout bar it is a cheap imitation and so crooked that it is unusable just received it and immediately getting returned i'm lbs and this still put dents in my doorway i also had to send in more money to buy an extender bar because this was too narrow for my doorway missing parts doesn't work i haven't even gotten mine out of the box yet but the box was trashed when i received it as well as pieces of the product bent not happy it's not easy to find a door where you can use it i like that this pull up bar does no damage to my door way structure however the way it is built does not allow any room for wide grip pull ups it's certainly better than nothing being able to hit narrow grip pull ups and it works well in this regard but in most doorways its not really possible to do wide grip pull ups i just received my bar today and put it all together and tested it out first of all it doesn't fit properly on my door frame but maybe my door frames are just a little bigger than others so whatever i was able to get it on my door frame just enough to be able to test it and the middle part of the long bar bent under my weight i'm a little under lbs don't use with kipping pull ups this does what it's supposed to do and if i lived in a modern construction i would have rated it a star higher however my house was built in and the molding around the thresholds is about inches wide and this pullup bar doesn't even come close to fitting how have i used it then my kitchen door has more elaborate trim and i'm able to get it latched on to some of the detail of the trim otherwise this is product is sturdy lightweight and functions as advertised product game missing some screws when i tried to contact iron gym to get replacements they never wrote me back this is a fake and when i received mine it was damaged and scratched as welld inspect your unit thoroughly before starting to use i was waiting for amazon to restock their unit they finally did and i received mine quickly a first glance inspection told me not to use this there was rust forming near one of the holes for the bolts to go through this was on the outer painted side i shined a flashlight inside and saw more rust i would not trust the integrity of this product to bear my weight when there're signs of the metal already deteriorating as soon as it arrives i did not install the product and am returning it to amazon some other items to note upon my inspection the black rectangular bar at the top is flimsy plastic with a thin thin piece of foam this foam will not protect your walls if you do go ahead to get this you will want to purchase a sturdier foam sheet to protect your walls doors as it will definitely leave marks dents fake not able to use on any of our doors so i can't fairly review product this product is not fit on my door frame or any other door frame that i've tried my home is older it has molding attached to the header above the door the picture with the instructions shows it being used with a single piece of wood above the door not a door with decorative moldings just received and already hit a snag the nuts provided are different than the locking nut shown in diagram additionally there are regular washers provided along with the spring washers referenced in the diagram there are no regular washers referenced in the diagram concerned this might not be safe to assemble using hardware provide vs what is clearly outlined in the parts list and diagram provided you need to have a door moulding for this to work other than that it feels very sturdy while doing pull ups i couldn't find a decent door frame to use with it in my house the door frame cove moulding was not strong enough i received an open package with something that looks like a fake product the piece are broken and the screws aren't even from this model after waiting days i am pissed only works on or less molding otherwise it's basically worthless be very careful with this device it fell right off my door and i nearly broke my ass literally probably a good product but it didn't fit the non standard door frames in my older apartment doesn't adjust for different thickness of doors my door is normal width and height has a rim that should work great but i guess the depth of the door is to much for this this would be perfect if they made it to fit a door hello out there in pro fit world are you kidding me do you not realize that most doors are wide i had to make wood extensions on the inside of my door just so this would fit my door in other words it was too small across with a much calmer tone she said but i do love it word of caution though where you see the horizontal bar on the top there you will need to add some wood screws into the door molding where there are studs so it's super secure so when crazy kids start clowning around on it like a monkey they don't come crashing down to the floor you really should have these two bits of information in your instructions pro fit people can get hurt otherwise leaves black stains in door frame it has to be against the molding of the door frame which my older style home does not have and have not found a way to make it work for pull ups it works as expected on the floor for sit ups still highly disappointed that we can not use it for pull ups fits my outer diameter door frame great for chinups but not good for overhand pull ups doesn't hold the grip between the door not using right now pretty disappointed it was a knock off not the name brand as advertised also it didn't have the correct parts i am giving this iron gym total upper body workout bar only stars because it does not in fact fit all door frames our house was built in the s and we couldn't find a doorway that works well at all we have put it in a doorway that we don't care about and it is functioning but it is not held solidly having said that though the bar seems to be adequate for its exercise purposes none of us are very heavy we range from about pounds to pounds in our family the bar does bow a tad for the heavier people but it has held up fine for the last couple of months under our use it was nice for the first week then it cracked on the side and it was over from there the side foam covers are cutting away due to the pressure on them when i lift my fat ass this cause marks to be left on the wooden door frame and leads to my dad fighting with me this device is easy to put together but i hate the fact that i have black wooddy spots on all my doors it doesnt grip very well also make sure you have a strong frame railing please keep in mind the depth of the door my door frames are wide with molding that's wide but the depth of my doors is about i must have missed something because no way a company would be that absent minded to withhold a key detail like that i now own a great pull up bar that i can't use thank you iron gym parts wouldn't fit together screws bolts wouldn't work right badly made so i ended up throwing it away after the seller never replied to my email asking for a refund exchange i would not suggest buying this if i were you not bad but can't find any doorway to fit it perfectly probably should have measured my doors before ordering broke in two poor quality pieces didn't fit together so i can't use it at all defect cannot fit threw door way this bar is great but i got a fake one i noticed that the nuts were wrong and then realized i got an off brand i ordered prime very challenging wish it was adjustable it doesn't fit in a few of my door ways to be fair the reason for the low review on the product is because it came with the wrong hardware for assembly so i had to go to home depot to purchase the right size bolts to put it together the bolts that come with the gym are not long enough and there is no phone number or contact information with the instruction booklet or on the box in order to inform the company about it after driving to home depot and spending an additional cents for the right parts plus the gas to go there and back i was able to assemble the home gym it works as expected and is able to support my weight roughly lbs that's the only reason it earns two stars instead of i got a fake product i didn't even realize it was a thing to sell fake products on amazon until i got the package the box itself looked like it had been perhaps sold and returned a few too many times really beat up looking torn and taped the instruction booklet looked like it was handled by someone with no attention to detail or perhaps didn't speak english very well the headers for each page were all about diet yet the content was obviously mostly not about diet the bar itself was hard to put together because it was manufactured poorly the holes didn't line up so over all when i beat it into submission the apparatus was pretty crooked i did manage to smash it over my one non oversized door frame but again its crooked so pull ups are going to develop muscles unevenly i still have it up it can support weight but overall i was super unimpressed and wished i had realized it was not a true iron gym product didn't fit my door and there was no indication that that would happen the wall wasn't thick enough to accommodate the gripping system amazon accepted return no trouble also i have had friends accidentally purchase knockoffs from amazon star for being so misleading it does not come with the abstraps if i had known i would have bought the cheaper iron gym listing so frustrated about this there is a card in the box to get free abstraps with only shipping feels a bit flimsy when using but it seems to hold securely very helpful in showing how weak i am the black handle wraps when pressed against the wall leaves stains place a towel or such behind before using does not fit bigger sized doors there should be an extension or should be wider the screws they included were too small defective product was not able to build the product the screws are bad will be returning i should've read the negative reviews prior to purchasing the product each doorway in my home is too deep for this to sit flush against the wall my doorways measured about inches in depth almost each doorway is also too wide and would require me to purchase an additional extended long bar via mail order for an additional additionally your doorway must have molding on the top of the door frame that allows a safety wedge to fit between the molding and wall tightly because the flat piece on the workout bar clips into the device i am extremely displeased at the poor description provided by the manufacturer on the amazon site in my opinion the dimension requirements of the doorways should be included in the main description the bar is only long so it will not fit doorways wider than about i'm disappointed that the doorways in my apartment are too wide for the bar to fit i live an apartment building built in the 's all the door frames have a slight molding around them this does not fit on any of my door frames for the future they should add this as a warning in their descriptions ours didn't come with drilled holes we have to drill the holes ourselves and hope it doesn't break when we try to use it does anyone else have this problem with defective parts my daughter is up to me i won't say pretty solid product took about minutes to put together i ordered this from a third party seller through amazon and even before knowing about the counterfeit ones i knew was something fishy first the non slip rubberized feet were loose and kept popping out of their place the screws that came with it didn't match the screws in the instructions manual the paint on the bar chipped easily before i even had a chance to use it i thought it wasn't a big deal then i came across a review on amazon and saw the review by someone who also received also received a counterfeit iron gym pull up bar my pull up bar looked just like the fake one in that review one red flag is that it doesn't have the tm logo anywhere it just says iron gym the only difference between my fake bar and their fake bar was that mine didn't come in a white box it came in a colored box and my instructions manual was in b w theirs was in color through a quick google search which i should've done in the beginning i found iron gyms official website based in europe and saw that they are aware of counterfeit pull up bars being sold with their name to avoid fakes they advise you to buy from an authorized dealer i immediately returned mine i didn't bother getting a full refund and lost total i have amazon prime if anyone is wondering if you decide to keep your counterfeit pull up bar beware it will most likely bend in the middle i saw a picture of a bent one through another quick google search and iron gym commented saying they could easily tell that bar was a fake i now have one i bought directly through their official website the instructions are in color the padded bar has their logo with tm next to it also another logo that says pro fit tm the tools are exactly like the ones pictured in the instruction manual it didn't chip at all while putting it together doesn't feel flimsy it feels solid it came with free ab straps and a workout wall chart this is just a warning for those who buy this product sold by fullfilled through amazon received counterfeit item with grossly misspelled manual they don't tell you in advance that the total thickness of the door frame including trim can't exceed a certain maximum there wasn't a single doorway in my house that this thing would fit over so i had to return it we never were able to figure out how to hang this returned it i made the rookie mistake of not measuring the trim of my doorways appropriately i thought that i maybe able to manipulate the device not so much im sure it work just fine if i could hang it in my door way its a solid pullup bar i had been using it consistently for a year or so now just a heads up there is a chance of it damaging your door frame i fell down and landed on my cushion of a butt make sure to be using this product on carpeted flooring if i had fallen on hard flooring i'd probably be pissed injured was giving a conterfeit and knockoff iron gym images to show proof just look at the booklet and how they failed to spell nutrition oh and some of the screws were different from what was in the book too annoying to close your door i was really disappointed with this bar number one it is cheaply built i am a lb ' tall man and this thing feels like it is going to break every time that i use it the other problem i have with it is the arc that should put the support part of the bar over my moldings on the top of the door isn't really at the right angle it barely rests on the molding so i no longer use this product nor will i buy another from this company easy to assemble relatively sturdy doesn't adjust to different doors alright the center feels like if too much weight is applied here it would break apart has as it works good for pushups and situps but it just won't fit in in my door frame its not only about the width of the door the height of the molding needs to be small for this thing to fit properly the manufacturer should give a combination of molding width and height that works instead of just door frame width just got this item and while i was assembling this i put the wrong screw longer screw in the plastic part now the longer screw is stuck so i have to send this stupid item back because they did not mention that the screws had a different size stupid directions i bought this for my husband's christmas present however the first time he used it one of the bolts snapped off we got a replacement and my husband really enjoys it my only caution is to beware of the possibility of bolts snapping especially if you have an acrobat who would use it upside down purchased this for my partner they could have manufactured this product a little better in my opinion we wrap rags around the sides so it doesn't continue to scrape up the door frame the grips seem to be wearing down at an alarmingly quick rate he uses the bar for pull ups only so we aren't capitalizing on the total upper body part of the iron gym total upper body workout bar pro easy to use no installation needed con tend to fall off from the door frame bought this for my son and just went to put it together and i don't believe this is a legit iron gym the hardware looks like nothing on the box or manual and to me is unsafe the nuts on the box protect you from scratching yourself if you should come in contact with the iron gym mine are cheap and not protective at all i the hand grips slide back and forth and i don't think this is what they should do i will be contacting amazon and the vendor if i can figure out how to i'm sure the product will be fine as is my complaint is in the instructions the assembly includes the parts a bag of bolts closed acorn nuts and washers the bolts are one set of short and one set of long the picture doesn't say which bolt goes where and the bolts in the picture for directions appear to be the same length i attempted to loosely assemble the first part with the bolts only to discover i had the wrong size bolt there i thought i was loosely tightening the bolt but now it's stuck and i cannot take it out to switch to the smaller sized bolt the plastic safety wedge side is stripped where the bolt was since it is a softer plastic this was easy to do it doesn't appear to be able to withstand being taken apart and put together any times beyond assembly i moved on to put together the other side with the second available correct sized bolt for parts and had no trouble now that i have only of the pull up bar available this item is useless without cutting off the first bolt going to the hardware store to get a new one and pray it works for a mediocre set up i should have just waited to pick one up at a goodwill save yourself half the price and all the headache like the george foreman grill this is an item that you never need to buy new the equipment didn't assemble properly the bar was skewed instead of being straight returned immediately i received the product but the screws didnt seem to fit properly so i am having to go to ace hardware to get the right screws that is why this product is getting a i've used the iron gym pull up bar before a former roommate had one and i loved it and it's very effective as well as convenient however when i received the item two of the bolts needed to piece the item together were too short subsequently i had to improvise by going to a hardware store and buying new bolts and washers to supplement the two bolts that weren't long enough truly not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things but when you spend your money on a name brand product you would expect to get exactly what you pay for i understand mistakes happen but i hope they fix this for future customers i purchased this one and i received a cheap chinese knock off that was completely uneven upon assembly this is one of those things i recommend purchasing from a walk up retailer to make sure you are getting something that is constructed well not what i received which damaged my doorframe and bent almost immediately hate it works well but might damage your door frame and put black stains on it the padding to protect the door isn't enough i'd suggest adding extra padding i used mine till the padding wore off and and there were dents in the door frame i solved this problem with duct tape and a soft cloth this thing is dangerous i am a year old male in great shape i do fitness modeling i was doing upside down pullups and the thing came off the door knob check what those are if you want to know i was falling head first but somehow i luckily landed on my back and messed up my rotater cuff the fact that i fell on hard wood floor does not help either what i am saying is be carefull with this thing it is not as safe as people make it out to be i now have a regular pullup bar that stays on always these things come off too easy and its too damn dangerous unfortunately this came with missing pieces returning poorly made this pull up bar popped off and my son landed on his back it's not secure i'm wanting the distributor to send me more secure metal tags to keep it up i've heard nothing not satisfied seems unsafe as is was not impressed this pull up bar is not good returned it and opted for the prosource heavy duty easy gym doorway instead i think this would have worked great if the crown molding on my door weren't so high my fault for not measuring seems like a sturdy product though unsafe product the long bar twists together unlike newer models which bolt together in the middle the product received didn't twist together properly and as a result was loose when connected when full assembled the long bar could come apart very unsafe don't waste you money on this model of the iron gym pull up bar buy one that bolts in the middle you're better off two stars because it was very easy to assemble and looks effective but would not fit i have an old apartment with thick molding and can't find any modification to make it fit disappointing that it's not adjustable it is only for short very short guys if you are an average or tall guy it is not for you unless your door is feet high very uncomfortable on standard door it works fine as a pullup bar i'd not recommend trying to do dips on it the pads that keep it from scarring up the wall bar end pads both tore off within two months of consistent use also the strip where it locks against the top of the door peeled off these aren't wholly detrimental to it's use i still do pullups several times a week with it but be warned it will probably mark up your wall a bit seems good well made but does not fit my door frame so i can't use it if i could give this a no star i would bolts weren't long enough to put it together so i couldn't even try it out automatic return didn't fit my door frame not adjustable at all cheap materials didn't seem sturdy enough ended up being a completely useless purchase the product was extremely difficult to assemble the tools were inadequate and badly designed horrible product it was broke when i got it isn't as adjustable as the perfect multi gym doesn't feel as durable either my problem was to put this together the packing was ok to put this together was a nightmare the screws would not fit it so i had to return this back i have regular sized doorways and the grip was not accessable the only way to use this was to have a very closed grip the reason i gave this a star is because during use it fell off of the door it had been placed properly i checked before i hopped on it and i ended up getting a really painful lower back injury as a result it is not a safe product as advertised putting this cruel puzzle together combines a literal interpretation of the trying to fit a square peg in a round hole metaphor with the old adage that insanity is doing the same thing over over again expecting different results or in simpler terms the parts of this product were so cheaply imprecisely made that nothing fit together the way it was supposed to the thing broke before i was even able to get the opportunity to pull it crashing down from my door frame it does not fit any of my doors with molding which in my house is all of them xd i still use it for pushups the product will not work if you have crown moulding above your door did not fit my door total waste for me i went to donate it and was not surpised to see that there were already two of the same bars inside the thrift shop doesn't fit our door frames we live in a house built in with think wood framing really disappointed there is just one newer door frame in an upstairs bathroom but we need to take it down to close the door works great if you have the basic wood frame received this last night and was super excited to put it together and use it however i was very disappointed when i realized the medium bolts they included were not long enough the end of the bolt could barely be seen coming out of the hole to attach to the plastic bar after reading other reviews it looks as though i received the cheap knock off of the real thing returning it now and unfortunately decided to just go to bed bath and beyond and use a coupon there don't trust the next one won't also be low quality if i re order from amazon left and right bar don't fit into each other one of the pieces of foam slips around making for a somewhat uncomfortable pull up otherwise its good foam was ripped up arrival and the foam spins when i do pull ups seems like a cheaper version than what i was expecting trash don't bother with this pull up bar if you live in an older home in boston e g older than which is of them doesn't fit boston door frame moldings which are too large to fit this probably similar problems with other older homes and wide moldings trust me i had to sadly return mine b c it's not adjustable and waste money and time on doing so more than one friend also returned theirs having an adjustable bar or measurements for door and other frames would be a good idea does not fit many door frames so basically i have not been able to use it is smaller than the dimensions listed in the product description does not fit my doorframe even though it is well within the stated measurements i received this box sealed with tape but upon opening wtfreak no tools bolts or washers how am i suppose to assemble this according to the instructions this product is a total waste of money after my husband put it together it was crooked and completely unusable we took it apart and tried again being very sure to follow the directions exactly but it is still crooked and unusable i just went to return and get a new one but it says the return window has closed leaving me no options but to throw it in the trash so annoyed nothing more and nothing less it was exactly what i imagined it to be i would have given it stars however if it had fit right on my door i guess my door moldings are a bit thicker and so it site a lil bit angled but it still supports my weight and what i need to do they make attachments for longer wider doorways but nothing to accommodate thicker door molding or doors with thick trimming got it promptly problem is it is not square the pipe doesn't twist enough to make the two holes face the same direction so when i put it up on the doorway it is crooked and doesn't make even contact just ok either the curved bar is too short or my door frame is too fat it just did not fit and i use it only on the floor they should also add on the pads it seem light filter worked for three weeks and then stopped working awful product the water tastes bad and unfiltered even after running and dumping copeis amounts of water i expected the filter to filter out the chlorine taste and make the water softer however that is still not the case this filter has less than gal capacity it costs twice as much as other filter designs that have times the capacity moral don't buy refrigerators made by whirlpool and that use this filter design the refrigerators may be sold under various brand names this product does not work with a whirlpool wrs fidm even if description says it is a replacement for w a filter kept making thudding noise like it was clogged i thought i just got a bad one but the second filter made a mistake of getting a pack also made the same noise i ordered next is an mountain flow blue filter and worked like a charm will not buy this product again do not buy this product i purchased this for my whirlpool refrigerator and it stopped working after days no water was coming out of the dispenser and i could hear a weird sound when i pressed the dispenser for water do not buy from this source these are defective filters i replaced the old filter with the one i received from amazon having done this many times before and the new filter made a grinding motor sound and barely dripped water i re installed several times with the same result i subsequently went to home depot and bought the same filter which installed and worked perfectly on the first try they are selling defects do not buy from this source product stopped working tried resetting but doesn't work have used same product for years this filter broke within three months of use i'm disappointed that it did not last months as expected my filter delivered march st and it's april th and it stating that i need to replace it again i do not know exactly what happened but the ones ordered are not the ones needed on the advertised show same item but when you open the box filter is half the size of the original some of the comments said this would work interchangeably on whirlpool refrigerators however this was not the right part for mine maybe i missed the list of compatible refrigerators if it was listed on the seller page way too expensive would rate this zero stars if i could tested our refrigerator water before after days after no changes absolute waste of money wish i could return it just paid for nothing didnt work defective amazon not helping with exchange and whirlpool washing hands to it very frustrated and disatisfied i think i got a bad one because i've used this filter before in our same fridge and it was great this time though the water tastes funny like something biological is not getting filtered out there's a slight rotten taste the new funky taste appeared when we replaced this same everydrop model filter with the new one the old everydrop one still had of use on it according to our fridge but we replaced it with this new one and the water immediately tasted weird i went on amazon to see if i could get a free replacement but i'd have to return the old one that is not easy to do it's wet it's been used and is still being used until we can replace it so i've just been waiting for enough time to pass that buying another fridge filter makes financial sense not sure i'll buy this one though update i ran about gallons of water through the filter before trying to drink the water is still cloudy and tastes bad i will never buy water filters from this company again so i read the packaging completely it states that i need to read the instructions and refer to the owner's manual for proper installation and operation what owner's manual i know installation is not rocket science but if there was supposed to be an enclosed instruction sheet or manual where is it all i want to know is how many gallons of water do i need to run through it before it is safe to use works great but i found it at walmart for about this price so i will not buy again they work fine but boy are they expensive i've gone to the zen filter for less than half the price awful plastic taste no reduction in chlorine smell much much worse than just using tap water with no filter i suggest a reputable in line filter instead and a bypass module this is the nd everydrop filter i bought in months both lost their flow and crapped out in weeks just after the day return policy terrible product for twice the price stear clear of the one water still taste like chlorine months after replacing water has a metallic taste after changing out the filter and when i provided feedback to amazon i received a message to contact the manufacturer disapointed with amazon's response and lack of assistance in resolving the issue this only worked for about a month can nstantly clogs up and i have to remove i and shake it very aggravating the filter did not last it was suppose to be a six month filter i already need to replace it it only last about months not only is this product way overpriced which i wouldn't mind if it worked well but it caused our refrigerator to leak water all over out floors our inside of our fridge and as soon as it was installed our ice maker stopped working now if we want water we have to leave it in so we have to shove towels inside of the shelves and along the outside of the refrigerator our water does taste fine so i guess at least it is filtering our water but our previous one never leaked and it was cheaper i bought this filter last year and replaced the old one just now but unfortunately it came defective i couldn't return it to amazon because the over days return policy so my husband tried to contact the manufacturer manufacturer's costumer service was horrible they hung up on my husband twice if there were a zero value to review this product i would use it bad and expensive product easy to install does what it's suppose to defective product have ordered this product several times and it's worked this time the water did not flow through it at all ordered a replacement which was also defective don't purchase good but flow rate plummets after two weeks and it takes forever to fill a glass this can t be right no way we used gallons in that time period pretty sure i got a faulty or knockoff filter it fits correctly but our water tastes horrible since i put it into our refrigerator the prior filters i purchased from a website that specializes in these and had no problems with them in the past like i'm having with this one frustrating cause these things are crazy expensive when they should be more like twenty bucks ugh i says it fits a whirlpool filter w a but it does not this filter is at the bottom of the fridge and the w a is at the top shelf upper right corner in the cool food side i am concerned that the water being dispensed is cloudy i hope it goes back to being clear after a few uses not sure if i should just re order a new one or keep it better flow than the ones that came with the fridge and subjectively the water seems to taste better i've read this one filters out fluoride better than the old factory ones did though i haven't tested that stupid expensive for a filter though they've got us cornered with the custom filter type nothing special water was murky for awhile seemed like i had to run way more than gallons thru it if i buy another then i survived i didn't open this order for months i purchased ahead i did not get what i ordered it was not the same color nor was as it appears on the package my refrigerator made a loud noise when i tried to use the filter not the correct product it was not what i ordered and too late to return it open and try the product right away don't recommend it way too expensive might disconnect ice maker and fill trays at this price a year for what what is wrong with you so just in case others are not paying attention like me this is an ice water filter not the big one for the bottom of your side by side frig this is tiny tiny tiny it's for up in your ice maker compartment i don't have one there i have the big one at the bottom for the whole frig the filter selector said that this model would fit my whirlpool side by side it doesn't i had to get it but i don t like the price or that i have to dispense gallons of water before using it seriously strange after taste expensive but got close to months from it tds meter from zero water filter says it removes little from the water probably so not a discernable difference from tap water maybe slightly less chlorine worst part about this is i have to flush a glass of water through every morning or if water sits for a while or it acquires a terrible plastic type taste not a fan do yourself a favor and look elsewhere defective item we installed this on since the monitor light was red the monitor light turned green but on the light turned red again this filter should be good for months not six days the filter design must have changed recently this didn't stay fully inserted into my fridge like past filters it was off by a small amount too short and wouldn't keep contact to the pieces to let water flow through ordered and neither one worked without having to hold it in place not sure if this the seller or the filters themselves are defective this has given me a lot of grief the water flow suddenly stops and you have pull the filter out and plug it back again for it to work sometimes it makes an incredible racket probably because it comes loose and the water pressure makes it do that the last one i got from home depot and was fine am going to get one from them again i ordered my nd one of these st one worked fine water doesn t taste better than without the filter it s about the same nd one came today and it leaks bad and makes a horrible grinding noise i requested a replacement hopefully the next one actually works never worked ordered never again too pricey but work well so far filter appears to be incompatible with kitchenaid refrigerator krsc ess since the fridge signals 'change filter' within two months of installation though filter is supposed to last months maybe better to buy directly from manufacturer no way we have processed gallons water from refrigerator stopped working when we installed the new filter we know it is the filter because when the filter is removed the water flows fine we buy this particular filter because it is a genuine whirlpool part and we are very disappointed previous filters worked fine so there must be something wrong with this one garbage doesn't filter the water the old purple ones worked perfectly fine this one is not actually filtering the water and is very loud return after months of use my refrigerator asked to replace filter it might be something wrong with this particular item since last filters lasted months can't get it to stay in my fridge tried trouble shooting in every way i could think of it is possible that there has been some sort of a modification made to filters since i bought my fridge we eventually just gave up we are now just drinking unfiltered water out of the fridge but at least we have ice again really disappointed water was smelly and tasted funny i followed proper instructions cant play around with water so i payed a bit more and went to home depot and replaced it wish i coould get a refund but window closed and its too late not sure if thus was a legitimate product the water tasted horrible filter popped out often too we were very disappointed and will not buy it again original september purchase product came in original manuf packaging fits well and works fine march update went for more water and got the hammering sound upon opening the filter cartridge area the paper towel i used to pad the cartridge is now soaked redid papertowel little thicker and when i went back to check on it a couple hours later paper towel getting wet again just submitted a refund request will try to buy from a brick mortar store to see if i have better luck or even try to find an alternate option will see what works march update bought again but had issues when i installed it i d get a hammering noise and then no water would flow searched high and low for the how to fix and found it on a youtube video the latest cartridge i received was ever so slightly smaller than the last one so it was making a complete seal when the filter compartment lid was closed so upon advice from the youtube video i put in a folded piece of paper towel about sheet folded up btwn cartridge and door and voila it worked w out issued no hammering noise and water flows freely will update again if this changes anytime soon wrong size even though i ordered the right size according to mfg instructions flowed great for the first hours then immediately slowed down to a very slow flow disappointed it worked only for a month and the indicator turn red this water filter cost us in fridge repairs only use the filters from the manufacturer our fridge repairman said none of the off brands work right in the long run do not buy fits but sometimes leaks and needs to be reinserted odd for factory part may try something cheaper next time it does not works when insert it goes out in two seconds so cannot use it works price is rediculous great product but the cost is up there in six years of buying filter would have payed over half of the cost of the refrigerator this is way overpriced and doesn't last long only about months wish there was an alternative the whole time i had it the water tasted plastic works fine filtering water i had to suffer through a horrible plastic taste in the water when i replaced this filter that taste lasted even longer in the ice cubes i bought three filters and i dread putting the next one in does it filter the water well yeah but replaced my filter and within days could not get water refrigerator is under warranty so repairman came out it was a bad filter i try to keep a filter so i will have it when one goes out this was purchased in july but not used until october no warranty i guess on the filter will only buy local from now on if i can find one this is the second everydrop filter i ve used with my whirlpool frig both have given my water a very metallic taste tap water from local restaurants around me tastes better what s up everdrop this product was hard for me to find and choose finding whirlpool amanda water filters for my fridge unit took a lot of time and effort until i finally came to this product although i feel that the price for this product is too high it was one of the only options we'd got to find a filter that would replace our outdated water filter in our fridge i was hoping to find a water filter branded by either whirlpool amanda or at least the same brand as the filter they've already installed in my fridge this product was bought because our old filter reached its month limit and after a few months of use the water change taste we had no choice but to but a new one and luckily we found this filter which was compatible after installing you have to throw out some of the water and ice from the fridge as instructed in the manual to install there is this square compartment on the bottom of the fridge outside pull it and the filter pops right out replace and push tight to close the compartment this product was useful but i prefer a lower price for this product defective after three weeks it locked up and started causing a loud rattle in the refrigerator this is the second time i've had this issue with this particular brand and the return period ended too quickly for me to return it bad product bad return policy lasts no where near months might get out of it too pricey for that kind of replacement i put in the model number of the fridge and this is what you recommended to use when it arrived it did not fit i had to go to home depot and get the correct part you should make finding the correct replacement part a lot easier to locate only one i can buy for my refrigerator not made in china not trusting any food or product touching my consumables from china this one made in taiwan which i trust a lot more none made in usa for my refrigerator used for two weeks and the filter light is already on red meaning it need to be replaced and the water clearly shows particles floating around these made our water taste horrible it tastes like your drinking iron will not purchase again ordered the wrong filter no way to return or exchange that i can see bought lots of money waisted i got a bad one install this filter before the return policy prevents a return i got a defective filter and i can't return it cause i waited to long to install it the filter won't let water pass through it for some reason gotta order another one flushed gallons as directed clogs after every cups of water now removing it and letting the water drain out in the sink gives me another cups waste of money water won't go through fast enough barely drips through at all causing frig to make loud noises we drink water often so for the two of us the filter only lasts for about six months before it asks to be replaced prefer that it last an entire year the website is wrong it does not fit the fridge so frustrating this lasted only months with just kids drinking water from the refrigerator why do they charge so much for these i have used these products before without a problem i installed this filter and the refrigerator will not recognize the filter has been changed i retried this several times and even called sears to make sure this was the right one to buy and for some reason the water flow is acting up i don't know if this filter is the cause maybe it didn't send the right signal that i have a new filter or what but what an expensive risk not an exact match for oem this filter is too long and the filter door will not close this does not fit the fridge the model is for they said it would fit all whirlpool refrigerators it didn't fit mine when i emailed them about the problem no response this filter is no good at all it has completely caused more problems with the ice maker and the water sputters and then stops completely you have to keep reinserting it to make the water come out the old filter never caused any of these problems i now have to have a repairman come and replace the whole unit and hopefully the filter won't ruin this one too the sad part is its the only filter that fits wrong item so i return it i've gone through two filters and am very pleased with the taste quality and product in general my only complaint is that when it is first installed the instructions say you have to flush the filter for gallons it takes about minutes to stand at the refrigerator and press the water button not to mention the waste of water which i actually capture and use to water my plants on my next order i am going to look for a filter that doesn't require so much flushing i replaced filter on june th now indicator is on asking replace filter i am using same refrigerator and same brand of filter for last years looks like some filters are bad or counterfeit i have just reset the change filter button i will change after months we've only had this filter installed for two months and it has already clogged causing the water system in our fridge to shut down entirely lasts months that's a year to filter the water also it completely stops the water coming out at the month time period whirlpool is another greedy company with no ethics ordered the wrong product don't buy it only last month i have bought this brand filters for my whirlpool as ice maker and water filter before and it works months but this time it only worked month then totally clogged seems it quality is dropped very bad terrible only produces a trickle even after running gallons through it customer service said to just keep using it and flow would improve not so they need to review their performance specs no i do not like this product at all it is very bad you have to continually flush out the filter every time you want to use it or at least cloudy milk in your water i don't think that's healthy wish i could get a refund but i did not see the package for something i would have paid ripped off royally for the first two months i would have given this product five stars the filter removed the dingey flavor from our drinking water and it tasted great at about the two month mark though the water regained its foul smell and taste i am considerably disappointed to have spent money on a six month filter that lasted only two months and gave up without any warning all is well only lasted months typically we have gotten months before the fridge alarms to replace water is still milky after many days and many bottles the product stopped working after three months i want to replace the product i installed it on march and it stopped working i live alone thus my ice and water intake is nominal is this normal i replaced the filter in my refrigerator because it was the scheduled time but i now regret it the water no longer comes out clear i followed instructions to let out several gallons of water after installing but it still looks foggy i am now nervous as to what is in my drinking water isn't this supposed to be a filter meaning it cleans the water now our water has a funny garden hose taste to it seemed to turn red much faster than other brands that i have tried these are too pricey for replacing every six months especially when none thus far have lasted over months we do drink a lot of water but adding this filter every months feels like highway robbery i liked it much better when i could just use the unit underneath the sink that also filtered the ice and water the entire idea was definitely not for helping the consumers but the manufacturers they do the job but cost too much the filter is fine the price is ridiculous this is the first replacement i have bought for this refrigerator i'll be buying a generic the next time for a third of the cost i installed the filter the beginning on june and by the first week of july the filter was clogged really dissatisfied since the reccomended replacement is every months i hate this filter it fit perfect and the water seems to be fine but it causes the refrigerator to be considerably louder when it is cycling water the first time it happened i thought something had broken and that water was shooting out it wasn't but too loud especially if you have an open concept home filter was defective and had to be returned wrong filter product was fine but it was late i have a new refrigerator and replaced filter for the first time we have a green light indicating filter was reset our water is horrible tasting we have been buying bottle water until we can get a new filter this stopped working within a week stopping water from flowing at all replaced the filter with another brand and water worked again this is the second time an everydrop filter failed in my whirlpool refrigerator i installed the water filter but it isn't working my faucet water and my fridge water taste the same full of chemicals i have bought it before but this one is a dud i just got this a month ago and my water already tastes terrible was a must item for refrigerator easy to install and does the job it did not fit our refrigerator as advertised does not fit our refrigerator as advertised the filter worked well for a few months and i had the same problem as stated in a previous review it was the most expensive filer and i was very disappointed in the performance i needed to oder another filter after months of use works fine but water has slight strange chemical taste even after month of use tastes just like chlorinated tap water time to switch brands doesn't work i purchased one to replace the older blue filters model w w a while the new filter fit the water barely flowed through when i tried to start flushing water the fridge made an awful noise and when i opened up the filter section it started leaking water definitely won't be getting another whirlpool fridge in the future only lasted a month really bad quality it worked for two weeks and then clogged up water dispenser no longer works when filter is installed must be a manufacturing defect i entered my serial number from my refrigerator as required to find the proper filter it said this filter would work for my refrigerator it was wrong could not have been more wrong they do make the filter for my kitchenaid fridge but they don't sell it here unless you can tell what you're ordering by the package photo i would not rely on their set up for entering your serial number off your appliance or model number here 'don't like the taste of the water with this filter this blocked the water dispenser as i took this out dispenser started working saved me some money to call a technician to check my refrigerator no way to find out if its totally new as the top lock was not really locked i will prefer to order this from my refrigerator company incorrect part returned for the correct item no star review filter does not work other than the first draw of water after that it keeps reducing the water flow and making a noise why sell a filter that doesn't work definitely won't buy this filter again i installed this filter with the arrows pointing up as indicated but the replacement light stayed on next no water flowed into the ice maker finally upon removing it a bunch of goo came out now what it was expensive installed the thing and my fridge still says i need to replace the filter i read that these everydrop filters are replacing our fabulous blue filters so i bought one and it doesn't fit my fridge it keeps popping out and leaking on my top shelf horrible horrible horrible one size does not fit all waste of money not a good change from the old that we used to have i will give it a star this was not oem it leaked immediately and i returned it i never leave reviews this filter goes bad at around the day mark starts tasting like chemicals like others are mentioning do not buy i recently used this to replace the filter that shipped with my new fridge i have the same experience that most of the newer other reviewers have posted chemical taste the chemical taste does not go away after two weeks of constant use i also have a slight burn in the back of my throat after drinking water with this filter my kids don't but i do i just purchased a set of the purple filters based on advise from amazon reviewers hopefully the purple filters will work better like a lot of people have reported quality have taken a rather sharp dive on these units right now they barely last months then my compressor will start making a ton of noise as it has issues pulling water through them this is the rd time this has happened gonna have to try a rd party replacement and see how they are as advertised but expensive for a little filter horrible flushed about gallons after installation of this new filter and the water still shows particles visible to the eye in my drinking water in fact with initial filling of the glass the water looks very foggy but then dissipates after about seconds and appears clear but upon closer inspection you can still see stuff floating around did not have that with the previous filter i do not recommend and in fact advise people to stay away from it going back to old filter https www amazon com whirlpool w w a kenmore dp b k pv x ref pd sbs encoding utf pd rd i b k pv x pd rd r wa tst cf qz snsc en pd rd w d zsb pd rd wg faszq psc refrid wa tst cf qz snsc en fits perfect over the last month had to remove and reinsert twice due to water not flowing possibly an air pocket or something else but as other reviews had mentioned seems like a problematic issue with these units it's only good for six months quite expensive after replacement several gallons of fresh water stinks from the chemicals inside the filter later on is ok comparing to the ge products is lasting for much shorter time gallons these 'new' filters are garbage they are very overpriced they clog constantly and i either have to use an extra hard push to get them to seat properly in the refrigerator or take them out to shake and hit them first and then use the extra hard push to seat them i don't know if they're too short for the slot in my refrigerator whirlpool gsf c exw but i never had this kind of trouble with the original filters i haven't noticed a bad taste while using them but getting any water to taste out of them if far too much of a headache not sure if this filter is doing anything the tap water in woodinville washington has about parts per million ppm when measuring total dissolved solids tds measuring the water filtered with this filter i get ppm tds not sure if paying makes sense when safe level is ppm tap water is ppm for seattle suburb and this filter only reduces ppm i'd expect the tds to be for what this filter is commanding in terms of price do not buy this product my fridge was new with a new filter when it came time to get a new filter i ordered this one i flushed the water as i was supposed to on installation i have not been able to drink the water since installing it my year old son will not drink the water from my fridge it has a terrible chemical taste to it spend the extra money for the factory filter this one was a complete ripoff this is not the only review like this do not buy this everybody who has purchased this should be given a refund fits my kenmore fridge but took several days to start doing its job it spit out dirty unclear water for about gallons of wasted water on my end it leaked a little straight from the filter housing when i installed it and shot out at an angle from the fridge water spicket for a few days after installation never had these issues not sure if it's because it's compatible with so many brands or it's just not the best quality filter but be careful did work for less than two weeks looks like it is refurbishes i returned it the bad water smell is still there these are of course an exact replacement for the original filter it's just a shame that the price keeps going up water has a really bad carbon taste even after running multiple gallons of water through it for a week taste gets even worse if you let a glass full sit for a short period of time i assume this one is defective because i have not had issues in the past have to agree with other people complaining lasts only months bought filter as a spare in december installed weeks ago have run at least gallons of water through filter water tastes like plastic replaced filter with previous expired filter plastic taste went away would like to return product but bought too long ago even though it sat on the shelf for months not happy don't buy this water has a chemical flavor which will not go away at first i thought i just hadn't flushed it enough but we've been using the filter for a couple weeks now and the problem persists will never buy this type of filter again it seems like every time i buy this filter from amazon i have a problem i just replaced the old one in my fridge with one of the new ones i purchased and after a few uses the water comes out with a chemical y taste it also doesn't seem to be aligning with my refrigerator's water line because it's making a noise that can only be compared to a machine gun this is the second time i've had an issue with one of these filters purchased through amazon and it just seems like they're selling defective batches back to best buy for me filter lasted months for only one person using the fridge for a normal amount of ice filtered water i was very disappointed especially given the high cost of this filer worst of all there really are no other options bought this because i thought it would be same quality as one i purchased at lowe's boy was i wrong this thing pops out all the time and now my water also has a horrible metal taste i'll stick to lowe's for my filters too expensive bought this in december and for some reason the water does not taste good at all this replacement filter worked for about one year however it required numerous time throughout the year of pulling it out and shaking it to get it to work again the first two filters i had for this refridgerator the filters worked fine ever sense i have not been able to get a replacement filter that works worth a damn something is fishy here the indicator light on my fridge had turned yellow meaning i needed to order a replacement filter so i did just that my new everydrop filter comes in the mail quick as can be but i haven't changed it yet since the light hasn't turned red yet everything is hunky dory but then we had a power outage for several hours and when the power came back on the indicator light was green again this seems incredibly scummy to me this indicates that the fridge doesn't have a real way to determine whether a filter is in good shape it possibly only goes by how long it has been in the fridge or how much water it has already filtered and i'm not even sure it would be possible for the filter or fridge to keep track of how much water it has filtered if my filter was really bad my indicator light should still be yellow so take that as you will the actual water is delicious no complaints there the only reason i deducted those stars is because of what seems like an obvious money grubbing ploy make people believe that the filter is going bad so they buy an overpriced filter my fridge is only months old anyway it hasn't been used that long i did not think i'd have to be paying bucks every months for simple upkeep of my fridge we purchased the name brand filter with the expedition we would be receiving the quality we paid for but after months if use the fridge ice maker and water dispense stopped working after calling a repair shop they came out and replaced the ice maker and worked in the water dispenser only to find out the water filter we had purchased was actually to blame due to it being defective i ask that you assist me in making this right this filter didn't seem to do anything i ran more than the recommended amount of water through it when i put it in the water tasted like tap water i used it for a few more days and it didn't get any better i replaced it with a generic filter for about of the cost when i put in the generic filter and ran a few gallons my water was back to tasting well filtered again immediately i'm amazed that the quality from this could be so bad i will continue using the generic filters from now on and won't waste my money on this i ordered the wrong one sent it back thank you good price refrigerator filters are as bad as cartridges for cheap prayers in five years you can spend the price is horrific and i can't wait until filters arrived in the aftermarket i hate being gypped i have bought two of these filters and they only work for a few gallons and then they clog they have also caused my ice maker to sputter and now i only inconsistently get ice hopefully this will stop eventually the people posting positive reviews must not have my fridge wrs fdam stick with the old blue filters i find it hilarious how much whirlpool is pushing these overpriced filters when the old blue filters work fine my next fridge will not be a whirlpool i will be sure not to buy one that does not take drop filters my father in law has also had difficulties since using the new white filters as well his filter does not even stay locked in the fridge it just keeps getting ejected from the filter holding mechanism too pricey for what it is i installed this filter into my fridge and it has constantly made my fridge make very loud noises when the water is dispensing i've purchased a filter of the same brand before and this hasn't occurred it is unfortunate that the supposedly same product functions much louder than my previous one this filter only last is months at best and our water is allready filters by several other filters before it reaches the refrigerator and all we use the refrigerator for is ice pur is taking everyone to the cleaners with this one i will be going back to ice trays and turning off the ice maker and water dispencer it's not worth every or months this is definitely the correct cartridge for my fridge but it's terrible made crazy noises and it takes forever to get just a cup of water took it out and replaced the cap i am now using an inline filter these are the worst filters known to humanity used for a few days with no issues and then it begins blocking the water flow take the filter out and water flows through insert the filter and water is blocked again terrible filter very bad very expensive fit perfectly for my kenmore refrigerator later found same style for my refrigerator half the price check other site's before making final decision last about month on city water before getting notice time to change light came on just reset as per refrigerator instructions don't change until water pressure starts to slow down after less than months use the flow has slowed to about of what is was in the first week this unit should have lasted months so we are very disappointed when i went to place in order for a filter for my whirlpool fridge i was told that that there was a better and newer model the removed more particles than the previous model so i wen't ahead and ordered everydrop at a higher price and when i installed it all i got was water that tasted like it was from the tap sometimes if i dumped a few cups out before drinking a glass of water it would help with the taste and because i had to continue dumping out water the filter only lasted two months now i am ordering the original older model that came with my fridge don't buy top does not fit in the appropriate area meaning the padding for the chest is inches too low also legs are incredibly too small resulting in a very unflattering thigh bulge returned item i ordered size large i am ' weigh i've probably had at least water filters since i have my whirlpool fridge and this has to be the most disappointing one yet it looked to work fine and then all of a sudden the water flow stops i have to take the filter out and fling the water out now daily i've always been able to use filters beyond the built in filter timer on the fridge but this one started stopping up two months in and has gotten worse i could have gone for one of the cheaper third party ones but i wanted to go with the best from the oem and i feel like i've paid extra for the worsts this is the filter that came up for my kitchenaid kfis pbms it arrived i took the old filter out this is nothing like the old filter two pipe in instead of a tube on the old and the new one is too wide to fit into the holster i don't it's returnable better to go to the manufacturer's website to find out what the actual accessory needed is very disappointed can't really review as i ordered wrong filter water leaked gradually and now not filtering after month of usage filter got clogged after month of use never happened before just annoying used a couple times beforehand now the latest order is making our water taste funny not sure if it's a one off issue or not but debating on ordering elsewhere from now on as far as the filter goes it is a quality product and works well and deserves stars for that point however the cost of these filters is the reason for only stars seems rather high for something needing to be replaced ever couple of months in my opinion i purchased this time before this current purchase with no problems i ordered this about a month ago and started using it about a week ago i flushed it out with about gallons of water and it taste like tap water and it has a bad after taste unfortunately because i bought it too early before my last one went out i cannot return it these filters are not cheap and for us to not get what we paid for is unfair very disappointed did not fit working good filter became clogged quickly and filled with green slime replacement had reduced water flow not a good alternative to the oem version has left a weird taste to the water like other reviews have complained about the water isn't horrible but it doesn't feel quenching either i didn't really like the water but what other option do i have now that this is the only filter being made for my refrigerator the option of buying a new refrigerator isn't really an option considering it is only years old and works perfectly i wish they still made the pur filter that one was much better filter is fine but these things are prices ridiculously high now as far as i can tell they are the same filter as the old ones but the price has been jacked way up with the rebranding this replaces a product i was satisfied with but which is no longer made for my refrigerator this filter leaves a taste in the water that the previous model did not totally did not replace my filter my pur filter whirlpool was changed to dop but it is the wrong filter i gave stars because it came on time and well packaged but the product is defective the water tastes and smells worse than fawcet's i am returning and getting a replacement i like this brand because normally makes water taste good and remove a lot of undesirable elements from the water don't remember how many but i looked into other filters and this was much better after i replace will post another review hopefully with star review this is one of the biggest rip offs i've seen in a long time this thing appears to be time based meaning it's good for months then it sets off the bright red and somewhat alarming 'replace filter icon i've used this filter maybe times that's for every glass of water i've put through it talk about a scam more expensive than alternative products that seem to do the same job water will stream straight and then start streaming toward the back of dispenser all my other filters have never done this this was a new one i was trying would not buy again horrible regardless of how many times i've run water and ice through the filter i cannot get rid of the chemical chlorine taste this never happened with previous filters the new and improved one is absolutely awful i only had this filter for two months and its already getting clogged now i have to replace it and the prices is already so high i will try something else btw this is the second time this filter both times it clogged i don't recommend it made my water taste worse than fl tap water we quit drinking water from the fridge altogether i have spent more buying bottled water now than this filter cost scared to try something new at this point we bought this at amazon as a replacement for filter w a it fits doesn't leak and is easy to install it does it's job as long as it's not asked to do more our city conducted it's annual week long super chlorination of the municipal water system even though the filter was less than months in use this filter wasn't up to it the chlorine taste bled through to both ice and water we had to buy ice and bottled water at the supermarket when the super chlorination effort ended the filter resumed it's normal filtering function no more chlorine taste what's annoying is that the original equipment filters could handle the super chlorination deduct one star another annoyance is that after a new filter is installed it requires gallons of water to be flushed through the system before use that seems excessive to me and asking a great deal of the customer makes me wonder if the manufacturer might need to be encouraged to make a cleaner product and there goes the second star and there's one more thing it pops out no reason just pops out i have to keep a carton of something shoved up against the door to keep it closed maybe it's only worth stars doesn't take the bad taste out of the water i purchased this filter from sears and my water now tastes like chlorine why would you change a perfectly good product i am very disappointed with my purchase seems to be working fine just seems too expensive to me if i could give this a zero i would first of all i was previously purchasing the whirlpool brand filters for my fridge they were perfect that now say they are no longer available and this is the new model so i spent the and bought the new version i must have flush gallons of water through this thing and the water was terrible start to finish it had a weird chemical taste to it i returned it and bought a knock off brand for and the water is perfect so disappointed water and ice taste still like regular tap water treated with chlorine will not purchase again it clogged up my water dispenser and ice maker i had to remove it in order for my ice maker to continue to work down the drain stay away water is already not tasting fresh after a very short time previous filters have worked great for months but this does not seem to help with water odor after only a month i had been purchasing a pur water filter which was equivalent to this filter unfortunately the pur filter is no longer available which forced me to buy this one however like many reviews you're reading we are still getting the tapwater chemical taste the pur filter was awesome i wish they would bring it back i don't recommend purchasing this filter does the job i bought the pack the st filter was great but the nd is not working as expected so the rating loses stars for the nd filter the water tastes like it's coming straight from the tap w no filtration from now on i am just going to buy at a time so i can return it if necessary i don't pay almost bucks for a filter to still have sediment floating in the water after running a few pitchers through it the older filters i never had an issue with i threw away the box it came in as soon as it got here naively expecting it to work so no return there aren't good alternatives unfortunately all i can say is buy a pack so you might get that works this unit worked in my fridge and looks just like the unit that i replaced but it makes strange noises i finally bought one from home depot where i got the fridge and it does not make this noise disappointed in this product wrong size for our refrigerator had to return it this new 'last drop' filter works at least as well as the older model i don't understand all the controversy its still a pur filter pur is printed right on the box my problem is that this filter cost dollars and its made in taiwan that is a disgusting ripoff i don't mind paying for made in the usa there is no reason this filter should cost so much hey whirlpool make it in the usa or lower the price you remember that sweet deal you got on your fridge of course you do now we just need you to subscribe to our plan to get a new water filter every six month and the low low price of just a year you can cancel anytime but you wont because you need water filters for your fridge sound familiar you probably got something like that in the mail after you purchased your appliance competition pushed the profit margins on appliances way down and this is how they are making it up on the consumer many times over if my refrigerator lasts years with no other maintenance i will have spent quite a bit more in filters alone that i paid for the appliance itself i will give props to amazon they do have the best price around on this filter and i checked everywhere all in all it's such a great scam i wish i had thought of it i'm so addicted to the great taste of the water that comes from this filter i'll just keep buying them i can't help it maybe they put drugs in it stars off for the ridiculous pricing of these filters but my advice is to just grab a straw suck it up and buy it here anyway it fits but i find that the water dispenser is nosier than it was before this is apparently a new part to replace the old design lasted a few wks then kept popping out had to put it back in i'm the only person who uses the ref water ice should have lasted a few mnths green light in the ref never turned red before it stopped working also bought it directly from whirlpool had the same problem i then bought the three pack from amazon the first filter lasted two wks then kept popping out the green light was on i tried the second filter in the pack it has now worked for two mnths w the red light going on in two wks changed to green not sure if it's the filter or the refrigerator which i bought in mar never had this problem w the old whirlpool ref have one filter left hopefully it works checked website before ordering to verify that this filter was compatible however filter pops out within minutes of installation tried taking it out many times and readjusting but there's only one way to put it in it leaks a little every time it pops out too i had no trouble with w this is not a good replacement i'm not sure what to do now do not buy for whirlpool side by side this filter is only half as long if you were able to pole it into the hole you would never be able to get it back out it doesn't seem to purify the water frim frig works with our whirlpool fridge it works i don't know how a filter could ever get more than three stars did not work as expected filter sometimes allows water to flow and sometimes it does not unpredictable despite months of trial continues to fail to deliver as expected not worth the extra expense i'm not a fan of the new filters the water now has an after taste that the original filters did not have i also have to flush the line much much longer even after several weeks of use the water still has an odd aftertaste it has now relegated my fridge to be solely an ice dispenser since no one like the water alone water tastes terrible something between plastic and mildew i contacted whirlpool twice to try to replace it but they only offer a day warranty and suggested that i contact amazon to replace the unit i didn't install it right away unfortunately so i was past days removing the filter from the fridge the water tastes better my suggestion is to stay clear of this overpriced and terrible product i plan to invest in a under the counter water filtration system which i'm sure will pay for itself compared to the costs of these units thought i'd save a few bucks by buying this looks the same and it is the correct model for my fridge but it did not fit cudos for amazon for taking it back i used several of the older versions of this filter purple colored body and the water tasted great this new version white tastes like it is not filtering at all it fits it works thank you my fridge still reads replace filter after we installed it chemical taste won't go away even after flushing the recommended gallons we're now well passed gallons and it still tastes like a swimming pool it may filter out more contaminants but what matter does it make when you don't want to drink the water the old filter was fine this one is garbage didn't fit this product replaced another water filter it is terrible it is noisey the water smells has a terrible taste don't buy unless you have another alternative i like these filters and they work but man they are way overpriced i feel like i could just go buy a ton of bottled water that would last me as long as this does unfortunately i bought the fridge so i am stuck with this high price filter at least it gets the job done this is the third of this particular brand i have used and i will not use it again if i can find the old ones the first one worked fine but the second and third each lasted about a month before they completely restricted flow to the point where no water is dispensed waste disappointed have flushed around cups of water and still my water is not drinkable dollars down the drain water tastes horrible now have used it everyday for weeks now flushed it when i first installed it per instructions the whirlpool filters that were discontinued worked way better the new product seems to keep the same taste in the water as the previous a good thing and the flow is better but i removed stars for the insane price it went from to for no reason that pisses me off as i haven't alternatives when the original w filter expired we bought the new everydrop replacement from whirlpool the water tasted horrible with the new filter we replaced the reservoir in the refrigerator and the supply line as well still tasted bad couldn't return the bad filter because days went past it took time to get the plumber out here and to order the parts so i ordered another one thinking i did everything on my end so it must have been a rogue filter that one came and i installed and flushed and used it for about weeks the water tastes horrible i returned that one right away there must be a problem with the newly branded everydrop because the old blue filters worked just fine i'm out the cost of a filter a plumber and parts i'm going to try and find the older blue filter to see if maybe when whirlpool switched to everydrop there was some manufacturing problems with these newer ones i don't notice a taste issue but i'm having a problem with this new filter popping out when we use the water we didn't have any problem with the last one we bought but this is a new brand and it just doesn't seem to want to stay in it looks the same but don't they test these when they change suppliers not really sure what to do when we put the old one in it stays in just fine put the new one back in and it wants to pop back out when you use the water anyone else having this problem too expensive make sure you pay attention to how much water you use vs the month change period you may not need to change this out of you don't use it a lot i made the mistake of throwing mine away and didn't need to water tasted like crap had to return i may try one more as mate this may have been defective met expectations when i first purchased my refrigerator the water out of the dispenser tasted like bottled water i've changed the filter a few times this filter still allows a plastic like flavor to the water very frustrated i was wrongly informed by the distributor of our kitchenaid this was the correct filter my fault for not double checking this filter is not a substitute for ukf or just got this as a replacement for the filter in my whirlpool side x side does not fit well even though the model number matches cannot close the door and it leaks it is larger when set side by side with the original blue replacement filter i last used mos ago not a happy camper here sham i was not sent this product this filter was way too big and it didn't even come in the box pictured which is the primary reason why i bought it highly disappointed i used to purchase these when they were whirlpool w filter refrigerator water filter and they worked okay they were nothing special and the price is shocking for a what you get i don't have the initiative or tools to take a bandsaw to one of these filters but i bet there isn't any magic going on inside this cartridge other than the neat trick of getting you to pay x what it costs to make the thing every months after two years of paying for these things i decided to research alternatives i installed one of these at the top of the fridge watts yr premier filter year gallon inline ice maker water filter the economics are pretty self evident even if you find yourself unable to install this filter a handy friend or neighbor might be able to help you out for the price of a pack of their favorite adult beverage go that route and save yourself enough money for fun things here on amazon plus the water taste and quality seems comparable to me perhaps even better i put a label in the fridge with the date of when i installed this year filter so i know when to replace it and i just reset the stupid alert on the refrigerator door whenever it comes on have used this for about a month horrible plastic taste tried re seating the filter times the plastic taste is awful the price was excellent water comes out with lots of visible particles i hope it will fade over time my water was clearer with the expired filter transaction was smooth and delivery was fast i am convinced by the other reviews here not to purchase this please write to whirlpool and ask them to correct this error replace it with any of the filters that came before that were fine this ad was very expensive i'm not at all pleased that whirlpool repackaged and rebranded the filter and jacked the price in the process is it worth the extra money i have no idea but the new packaging is prettier it fits my refrigerator and water flows through it presumably purified amazon says stars means it's okay and that is my verdict i haven't been able to get this new every drop filter to work i've had my fridge for about years or so and never had a problem with the filters i've tried the seconds on off clearing of the line but the water never comes i switch back to the old filter and no problems anyone else have this problem are there any other filters that would work i'm almost ready to replace the entire fridge and this time it won't be a whirlpool this filter lasted only a month before the replace filter indicator lit again previous filters have lasted four five months way too much money for a fridge filter water still tastes funny for some reason i have never written a bad review for any product before this filter is that bad our water tasted great with the filter that came with our refrigerator last year now our water tastes like some sort of metallic chlorine mixture it's absolutely terrible i feel nauseated after drinking it do not buy this product find an alternative old style bought this new filter type because the model i used to buy is no longer being made apparently and that's a shame because with this new filter my water tastes like it's been aged in a plastic bucket this is the second filter we've run through a brand new refrigerator it came with the old version which even though it filtered less contaminants had much higher flow rate and tasted far superior interestingly enough this new version of the filter states it's flow rate is higher additionally this new version has a poor fit it's even popped out before which i know i'll get some eye rolls for but this ain't my first rodeo or second for that matter all combined it's nearly impossible to clear the line of air i chalk this all up to a combined lack of quality control on behalf of whirlpool the old version of this filter is abundant online which we're switching back to for now we'll have to drink the pharma water with an additional contaminants so we don't have to deal with the flubber machine we just purchased this filter a few days ago and loved the speed of the flow it's faster than the old filter it was tasting normal and then all of the sudden it tasted like chlorine it taste terrible not light chlorine a strong chlorine taste that not even mio or other water flavor additives can cover up it's actually giving me headaches never buying again this is the worst filter replacement the water is cloudy and the pump noise is awful i don't think this filter should be sold for whirlpool refrigerators i found three of the pur filters available at each high price but better than replacing the pump or ice maker because the filter is sub standard this is a rip off price is be in the twenties i need it so i paid for it but at that price point i will be running this filter until i have flow issuings i am not replacing this every months i ordered this from everydrop and after flushing the filter with or gallons of water the taste was terrible not sure what the taste is exactly but tastes like chlorine both my wife and i could barely drink the water the flow of water was definitely way stronger then i called customer service and they claimed that i may have had a faulty one and because i ordered a pack to go ahead and try the second one after flushing gallons still the same thing they sent me a replacement for the first faulty one but now i am returning all three i believe other reviewers experienced the same and i think this filter is either not filtering something that the older models were filtering or it just plain does not work ran the gallons of water through the system in fact went even more than that and still can't get the red light to shut off on a brand new refrigerator of which i have had one prior water filter without issue not thrilled i'm giving it a star simply because the product did does fit correctly and there are no leaks not as good as the old filter the water does not taste very good sometimes and sometimes it nosies the water run better but it make nosies amazon is being very nice and replacing it i called whirlpool and they said it was amazon fault because they sell returns i find that hard to believe the old filter was months pass months and work better i let you know about the next one update i returned the second one also if my glass of water got warm and i took a drink the water would taste so bad i would pour it out my tap water is better even after sitting awhile and getting warm the taste was better i will not buy again until they fix them update i called whirlpool filter department and they send me one and it works great i guess i got bad ones when you first install the filter the instructions have you flush four gallons through i followed the instructions and even emptied the ice maker so it could flush the filter a bit more by making ice the next few weeks we would fill a glass of water and notice after a few hours the water smelt like plastic with an odd taste you can't notice it unless the water warms up this does go away after a month of use but i'm wondering what i'm drinking i've decided i'm going to send the water to be analyzed and will respond to this review once it comes back i dont want my newborn or wife drinking out of the fridge until then i miss the original pur clear filters when they switched to the solid plastic everything went down hill when i typed in my fridge serial it said this product is correct but it does not work in my fridge it makes a loud noise and no water comes out still dispensing nasty disgusting looking and tasting water this is even after a gallon purge what a waste of money the filter business is a racket within a week of purchasing and installing this filter the refrigerator filter light went on and the water tastes very chlorinated very unhappy with this product i purchased the new version of the water filter for my fridge and i am very disappointed in it the water has a bad odor and taste i will be returning this filter and purchasing the old version i never had any issue with it this is not a suitable replacement filter it is extremely noisy i plan on returning this for the original part this replaced what i received was the pur brand filter which is what i have been used to using not the everydrop brand filter that is displayed fine but wish i didn't have to pay more for the same item i purchased six months ago i have read that the price increase is due to the brand change however i still received the old brand so i guess they are clearing out old inventory but pricing it as commodity expensive for a filter do not buy this product it was broken and didn't work ordered and installed this every drop model on my whirlpool fridge and noticed that the water ran much faster out of the dispenser vs with previous filters as if it was not being filtered amazon website did say that this model allows for greater flow of water and reduces more contaminants vs the pur model which is why i got it but the pressure seemed to aggressive the dispenser also made much more noise with this filter when getting water the kicker for me was the taste the water from the fridge with the filter in place was no better than the tap i tried reseating the filter a few times and gave it a few weeks to see if it would get better and it did not replaced it with the pur model that i was accustomed to using and things got instantly better pressure was lower appeared indicative of being filter vs running free unfiltered noise was gone and taste was much better went back and checked the place of manufacture for each unit every drop is made in antigua and barbuda amazon website misspells polypropolene btw pur is made in usa too late for me to return it was a waste of don't wast your money it make my water reservoir get stuck and i have to be pulling the filter out and shaking it before putting it back for the water to be released definitely looks different than the original filter after installing there is a noise that wasn't there before when getting water i bought this as a replacement for the filter that came with our fridge and i have run at least gallons through and the water still tastes chemical and plastic this is the worst filter i've ever purchased i will return to the store before i buy this product again i bought a water tester and tested this filter water then tap water and finally bottled water i am basically drinking tap water through this filter i won't buy it again i purchase a new whirlpool french door fridge earlier this month after running gallons through and dumping the first few batches of ice the water was funky the water had a bad chemical plastic taste that did not diminish with additional flushing i read several reviews on the previous generation filter same as my new fridge with the same complaint i was ready to send the fridge back i did a little information gathering on appliance repair sites and discovered source of the problem and occam's razor came to mind it was the new steel braided ice maker supply line mine was a watts brand made in china i bought it new for the fridge read reviews of various ice maker supply lines and you will see there is a serious problem with many manufacturers anyway i ordered a whirlpool rp feet pex ice maker hook up kit from amazon for about bucks with tax same material as the rest of the fridge's plumbing and the water tastes fine now i replaced my original filter just because i considered the original to be contaminated the new filter tastes fine although i am docking stars for the high price although i imagine that it will come down in price as its a new product with limited supply at the moment if you are suffering from that chemical taste unless you have a copper pex or a quality confirmed ice make supply line then you owe it to yourself to at least test it pull your fridge out turn the supply valve off disconnect the supply line from the fridge fill a glass with water directly from the supply line and taste it if it tastes worse than tap then you know its the ice maker supply line i honestly wonder about the economics of how many refrigerators and filters have been returned because the ice maker supply line is of poor quality too expensive is to much to pay for a little water filter that's only good for six months bought two of these because of a recommendation from a friend hoping to help me sleep better but they would make my eyes itch and burn after a few minutes of wearing them don't know if it's maybe an allergic reaction to one of the chemicals used in the process of manufacturing or not but i also gave one to a friend and she said her eyes burned as well so not going to wear them anymore also tried waiting a few weeks and washing them but still started to burn as soon as i wore them again uvex skyper blue light blocking computer glasses with sct orange lens s x gets high marks for excellent blue light blocking ability was the only pair i tested that blocks blue light really well unfortunately the styling has much left to be desired hence only stars blurry uncomfortable i hope find a use for them as safety googles the curved lens distorts the field of view and i feel dizzy looking through them uvex s x ultra spec are way better and easier to look through i have a narrow face and these are tight on my face the extension handles are not that long rip off it did not work as it stated bad the price is more than fair but unfortunately this is a case of you get what you pay for my purpose in buying these was replacing a pair of gunnar glasses that had broken with my gunnar's as a point of reference these glasses were a total failure they certainly aren't the most comfortable one side of the ear pieces felt like it was going to snap when adjusting it they fit very snugly i could live with the fit if the picture they provide wasn't somewhat distorted and drastically oranged with my gunnar's there is a tint but you can still see and differentiate other colors with these uvex there are no other colors just orange i wouldn't recommend them for computer glare and blue light reduction really uncomfortable and the color is more intense than other blue blocking glasses these do indeed block the blue light however they distort are quite uncomfortable and one side of the ear piece seems impossible to adjust and i'm afraid i'll break it if i try they appear very cheaply made regretting this purchase not recommended junky and uncomfortable why do people think they are glasses the glasses is really small even when fully extended lenses seems fine but it doesn't fit on a regular man not what i thought these are just cheap safety glasses that don't block any computer blue light uvex skyper blue light blocking computer glasses with sct orange lens s x my eye doc recommended yellow glasses like these for glare but these are actually more orange and made the flare much worse helpful but if i had been paying better attention i would have noticed that microsoft added a night light feature with a recent update had i seen that i would have saved a few dollars and used it elsewhere the glasses were helpful but i find the night light feature is suitable for my needs although i guess it depends on one's vision the fit on these are terrible only way they are usable is under my regular glasses not sure how well they work for blocking blue light or improving sleeps as they are such a pain in the rear to use i haven't worn them would not recommend this product if you wear glasses while working on the computer they were a little small for me so my husband is using them and he likes them they do change the colors on the computer screen and they seem to prevent eye strain cheap plastic not comfortable does the job but if you can spend more on better quality ones so tight they give me a huge headache and pain on temples cumbersome and don t fit easily over existing glasses ok on their own but not if you need reading or distance glasses remind me of safety glasses and seem a bit cheap looking the extendable side arms are not easy to adapt buy them for all round protection if you don t need vision correction and don t want to spend megabucks don't fit over my prescription glasses very well uncomfortable but i don't think they are meant to be used in this way i bought these glasses to block the blue light coming from my computer they are uncomfortable to wear too large for me the glasses keep falling down on my nose and when i push them up the lens touches my eyelashes just not a good fit for a woman i guess also the dark orange color makes things hard to read on the computer too small for my head more like regular safety glasses they did not cover my regular glasses well so i returned them may work for someone else light writ but the edges were rough sharp and even though adjustable the didn't fit well uncomfortable and slid down they help a little but don't cut down on enough of the glare they work but they get dirty and scratches easily which is annoying if you wear them everyday then you're going to have to clean them everyday also they are a bit big so they will slide down your nose if your face isn't that big i use these for blue blocking when i am on the computer the only thing i don't like is that when i am editing an highlight something the highlighting can't bee seen unless i remove the glasses uncomfortable my own fault i need to wear them over my reading glasses i'm not a fan these are work construction glasses the box is built that way and they are shown to be work safety glasses goggles maybe these actually do some good but they change the color of your view so dominately that it becomes difficult to wear them while working on a computer i would never use these to watch a show or something although it is lightweight it is not comfortable to wear the material looks durable and the product doesn't look cheap i'm still debating whether to keep it it's bad and useless excellent lenses but poor fit they are fine but the colors totally change when using them so every or seconds i remove them to see what and how the colors really are very disappointing not adjustable at bridge of nose thus does not fit i cannot use this item cbcv uncomfortable to wear on a regular basis the price is affordable it is hard to wear hard to fit on your ears and the glasses it doesn't seem to ease the eyes more like for construction these are really driving glasses they don't block blue light and when i've used them for watching tv i'm up all night from blue spectrum light reall just yellow colored safety glasses the glasses are ok but to put them over my own glasses makes mine dig into my face i probably should've returned them so if you wear glasses beware i like the blue light filtering but it's unwearable due to tiny temple length even with it being fully extended it's tiny small enough to fit my year old niece perfectly so if you have a tiny head this is for you if you're an adult male look elsewhere now i gotta pay money to send this thing back smh didn t fit over my glasses they are okay with my contacts though not very comfortable fit was terrible lenses were so dark that i could not see what was written on the computer screen do not buy eye strain headaches not good good job of blocking out blue light but very uncomfortable and just generally way too large small size i'm a big guy so these are too small if you armey an average hat size then this won't fit size runs small they work great but are tight on my head and leave lines since i have a large head average head these are great bigger than average man these are too small all who tried these glasses in our household felt they blurred their vision i guess the plastic is warped or something too small from ear to front not enough adjustment to fit over reading glasses these are not blue light blocking computer glasses says right in the instructions warnings what they are used for basic safety they are just cheap safety glasses purchased these for eye strain reduction unfortunately they are way too big and fall off my face fir amazon o list as it's choice i wonder glasses do yellow out but ear arms are irritating after awhile once again another cheap pair of glasses break very easily scratched up very easily don't work at all don't buy save your money you're looking for night vision glasses getting from your eye doctor you be doing so much better and you'll have something that will work cuz none of this does haven t used them that much on the fence gave me a headache after like minutes if you re looking for a blue blocker go with a more expensive pair impulse purchase i tried them at work heavy screen viewing tasks for a couple days and found that it was more annoying to have them on than off probably would have been better to keep my money in my pocket bought this for use with my laptop i get dizzy but i may have middle ear problems used them for a couple evenings then stopped they were much too big uncomfortable and ungainly i couldn t wear them and use headphones comfortably at the same time for example and they turned everything so yellow that my perception of things was off and i don t like that should have bought a stronger one i don't trust it they don't fit on my ears very well will not fit over prescription glasses unless you are very small temple pieces adjust to sizes small smaller smaller yet and munchkin it's alright but not really good for computer glasses the tint is too much i just wish gunnar made a model like this with proper lenses these would be better for shooting actually they seem more like safety glasses than computer glasses i like the way these work for my eyes but they do not stay on my head very well there is room for improvement here to make them better the colored lens are a bit drastic but i'm not too familiar with blue blocking technology the fit on the head leaves something to be desired a bit tight after wearing for an extended time because they are built like most safety glasses they are not too adjustable for width across the face length over the ears is somewhat adjustable though great price frame from eyes to ears are a little short i really need reading classes in the bifocal style i didn't realize how much i read or check my phone in the evening i will be purchasing blue blockers with my rx in them it's an accident doesnt work i still have eye strain it makes the screen all tinted and becomes very difficult to get used to color in images is very misleading these are actually dark orange glasses that kill close to of blue light would have liked to see a better image before purchasing can not wear over my glasses if no glasses it would be pretty good wasn't able to use because i wear glasses wish this had been mentioned in reviews my frames are not large but still no way to wear under these price is right more expensive elsewhere i read consumer report review and these were the only ones blocking of blue spectrum light they also make everything brighter and of course with the orange stuff is more yellow i got these to see if i would sleep better cutting back on blue light sources at night too early to tell one thing i didn't like is they are bulky and live up to their safety glasses description the other thing i didn't like was there was no 'skyper blue light blocking' description printed on the original box there was a sticker added on that said it was skyper but referred to 'spectrum' so i'm just a bit suspicious when a box doesn't say exactly what the amazon description says time will tell if these are good perhaps these work for a giant they are just so loose and large that they hang very low and so while a part of my vision sees through the glass lenses the upper part of my vision just sees objects as if i didn't have any blue light blocking glasses on at all i can't use them at all still reduces light impossible to wear these feel super heavy you are better off getting blue filter clips they work well as far as blocking blue light however the glasses are a little large and unwieldy if you wear prescription eyeglasses i've found that you have to put them on over top of these safety glasses because these glasses don't really fit well over top your eyeglasses the lense is fantastic and covers nearly the entirety of my field of vision except a small sliver if looking down however the end of the arms hook back forward and dig into the back of my ears and it hurts a bit the product is lacking an adjustable nose pad and thus the glasses either sit too low if resting on my nose sort of a reading glasses or if raised to the proper height they are resting on my cheek bones and by no means i have protruding cheek bones i bought these to wear before bed and although it really did cut out the blue light it was hard to get use to them and a bit too big for my petite face after a few hours in the office i find myself squinting at the computer screen these seem to help but make it harder to read papers on my desk they are very orange the sizes was too small the glasses do provide good coverage for blocking out light it does make me feel a little more relaxed but doesn t make me feel tired however the glasses are very uncomfortable they hurt my ears and the hard plastic from the orange lenses cut into my cheeks there is obviously a reason they are priced so cheap they re safety goggles doesn't seem to work very well bought for my husband and he hates them the fit is very small seems like they d be for a teenager the earpiece of the frame is too short bulky and awkward glasses i had trouble with the extendable length on one of the earpieces and nearly sent it back but after fiddling with it several episodes over a day and a half it finally worked its way out fantastic as a blue blocker crappy just makes everything yellow product measures too small they might keep out the blue light from the television but they don't fit over your glasses which makes it difficult to tell didn't fit well but i liked the other model uvex s x beware when this arrived it had a terrible smell from the plastic that some new items have but this was especially strong it took a long time for the smell to wain several weeks i tried these on the advice of a friend she liked them and said they worked for her i seriously wanted these to work for me however sadly they did not i purchased these for using with my laptop however the minute i put them on i felt sick to my stomach even enlarging a webpage to larger fonts everything i read was blurry and nothing was readable therefore defeating the purpose in purchasing them in the first place in addition they are very uncomfortable to wear even if i could read through them either way a waste of time and money i'll be returning them so the end result is it's been a disappointment and a waste of time does not fit well sidebars although adjustable are too small if you wear regular glasses get blue blocker clip ons these are miserable over glasses didn't help me with blue light didn't get over the glasses either they are very good at blocking the blue light but thay are a little too dark to see everything on the screen sometimes s lens is good until the first time you clean it i used these as safety glasses and i noticed after the first clean the lens had micro scratches despite using a proper lens cleaning cloth nb this got worse with more cleaning also being asian the glasses do not fit on my face which is odd as i have sunglasses that fit beautifully these glasses seem to do what they're advertised to do by relieving eye strain however i found that the wrap around curved lenses seem to distort my vision when trying to read on the computer screen i found that it's like trying to read while looking through a fish bowl not that i've ever done that perhaps it's just me i ordered a pair of clip on flat lenses to try glasses came a small scratch they work but seriously if you don't like having plastic weighing in on your cheeks then you might want to pass these up and go for a frame that goes all the way around these are not comfey at all these things suck seriously what a joke they're basically cheap orange safety glasses i bought them because of the good review and because they supposedly fit over your reading glasses but they totally don't plus even if they did who wants to put on two pairs of glasses in order to read your ipad i ended up getting the eyekepper spring hinge two tone color computer glasses in the strength i needed they're reading glasses and keep them on my nightstand perfect they definitely make it much easier to fall asleep after watching tv or using the computer right before bed time however they're cumbersome and while they do fit over my very small glasses they keep sliding off the frame and need to be readjusted every time you move so they definitely work it just isn't particularly pleasant to use them while they are good for blocking out the blue light from the tv so you can fall sleep more quickly they aren't suitable for reading because they distort whatever is on the page or screen the plastic lens is not optical quality nor was it made to be it was made to block blue light which it does very well however if you're looking for something to block blue light when you're reading on your phone ipad etc these are most emphatically not a good choice buy a better quality pair of blue blocking glasses for that maybe worth a try but i do not feel less strain or more pleasure looking through it do not buy these if you want to use with reading glasses i have tried them with different styles and none of them work junk not long enough sides even when adjusted out poor design i hated these really hated them if you want to see your computer in yellow have at it i got a pair from chemthec that i love wish amazon sold them but they are online disappointed that these were yellow not amber makes everything look yellow they also rest on my cheeks so as a result also cause my face to sweat good quality too small to fit over my prescription glasses too yellow bought these because of blue blocking property if they were blocking the blue light spectrum i shouldn't be able to see anything blue however the blue colored items on the screen are just as blue with or without the glasses very disappointing could not read my computer screen everything was blurred also very uncomfortable around the ears returned them the glasses are great and might be perfect for others but they fit poorly for my face and the bottom of the lenses dig into my cheeks whilst the tilt of the lenses is adjustable they don't let you tilt the lenses forwards very much i don't have this issue with other safety glasses don't fit over my glasses they did not improve my sleep a little large and bulky didn't seem to help me much may not be what i need i wear them sometimes but wish they fit over my glasses i was able to extend only one ear piece not suitable for wide faced asian didn't like them on my computer otherwise ok too tight on face makes you sweat i'm sure these are great safety glasses however i have no nose bridge to carry them as a result they pressed into my face and leave an imprint that everyone can see the glasses are too dark it is not comfortable reading with them on these glasses do block blue light the lenses are so dark they block almost any color of light i bought these at first for the price after a few months my children had gotten to them cracked the lens it is a single piece right down the middle later they got to the ear pieces and that was the end of them i felt that even on the brightest of screens these blocked too much to clearly see and though the adjustable ear pieces were a nifty feature all in all they felt more like outdoor construction glasses than anything else manufacturing cheap plastic seriously they feel like a set of the cheapest wal mart safety glasses feel uncomfortable to wear the nose pieces are indelicate and will start to hurt after a while to see out of them is difficult and i felt like every time i put them away was the last time i would see them in one piece performance they block light are slightly oversized so you don't have to worry about fit and the adjustable ear pieces with the wrap around side blocking were useful features however i feel that being so fragile cancels the usefulness of these features out also i found it difficult to see out of them so much so that i found myself frequently removing them to get a better look at my screen conclusion if you really have to be below for blue blocking glasses go ahead and purchase them they block more blue light than any of the other three brands i have tried which are shileded beison and gunnar optiks you won't get a headache from blue light when you are wearing these unless you are in the unlikely position of being more sensitive to light and prone to migraines as i am personally i recommend you spend a few extra bucks and look for another brand when the lens broke i took a butane lighter and melted the crack together it held for a few days maybe a couple weeks but eventually it gave out soon after the earpiece went missing and now they are surely in the city dump the material is bizarre they are almost impossible to clean the material grabs on to your cleaning cloth and so you cannot move it from side to side cleaning your glasses i use microfiber cleaning cloths for all my computers smartphones and televisions they make the computer screen blurry so i can't use them they were a wasted of money these seem to be designed more as safety glasses than sun driving glasses the adjustable arms give these a tight fit i think it may be too soon to evaluate this product for what it is intended which is reducing eye stress from the blue light given off by computer screen so far weeks i really haven't seen much difference i do have a problem with dry eyes and that doesn't help the situation i am assuming that it blocks bluelight but my eyes are still keep on getting worse even wearing it eh it was a bit tight for me and it doesn't really help only used a few times and now it already pass the return window time so i can't do anything about it oh well i just have to deal with the loss parts broke immediately but they still work i can tell i need more blue light blocked but it's still better that the straight screen i can check email on my phone with theses glasses and turn the screen down on night mode for minutes and still sleep ok but that's it i bought these to block out blue light to supposedly get sleepy at a normal time at night not sure if it really works for that since they're kind of annoying to wear longterm around the house however they were very useful recently when i had an annual eye exam and had my pupils dilated for me they were better than regular sun glasses at blocking out glare to be able to drive home afterward ok i bought these for my husband to wear playing video games at night i've got to give these glasses credit for being a great price and effectively blocking blue light though he didn't particularly like the color changes my husband thought they were fine for most video games but he couldn't play one game that had a more muted color scheme however i've got to leave the review at one star because we simply can't use them the way the lenses are molded as one clear piece creates distortions around the edges that were difficult for our brains to ignore they made me motion sick just wearing them for a few minutes and gave my husband a headache about an hour in to wearing them the frames are really really comfortable and light they do block out the blue light but i find the color distortion so uncomfortable that i don't use them much forgot they might not work over glasses my problem but we cannot use as we all wear glasses they are very bright yellow and seem to be protective glasses to be worn over traditional glasses they are quite large i had to request a return they were very accomodating and have an excellent customer relations dept not comfortable fine lol sitting in front of a inch monitor the text appears slightly blurred and out of focus it's better if i back away feet but then you can't use the keyboard and mouse gave stars for made in the usa but won't be using it with a computer the fit is poor unable to move bows to full length there fore cannot wear them poor fit and very uncomfortable they distort words gave me a terrible headache immediately and even worse made it so i couldn't fall asleep likely because of the headache and every night i've worn them my sleep has been very interrupted annoying to wear and made the laptop screen look weird but nephew took for working outside and liked them i got these to wear over my prescription glasses didn't work for me too big i have a narrow bridge and usually have a hard time with fitting i'm sure they're great for most people the item arrived broken one of the temple pieces were broken from the hinge upon arrival too big for a girl but ok glasses i bought to wear while on the pc but they are a little strange what they do to colors clunky just to big and do not fit well just didn't fit over my reading glasses too well bought these to block blue light but the intense orange tint make things look to bright not for me i passed these on to the goodwill and opted for a pair of rose colored lenses not sure if rose color totally blocks the blue but they're easier on the eyes this one is just too harsh of a color for me i felt tense and on edge looking at all this bright yellow this is the brand dr mercola recommended so i went for it but honestly dr mercola's supplements i agree on but his manufacturers eh so why am i surprised i guess it's just me but i can't handle that bright yellow glaring color on everything it literally hurts my eyes to wear these they're so intensely yellow bright i have a pair of gunnar intercept yellow tint glasses for looking at my computer i like them i thought i would try these too i don't like them anything within feet is blurry so these are not very good computer reading glasses beyond feet and they are clear so they might be good for shooting or as industrial safety glasses from the description and comments i thought these would fit great unfortunately they sit on my cheeks about one half inch from my nose i wish they would make them with the nose pads to fit properly but they do block the blue spectrum and i only use at night and seldom at that no comment disturbing to read books or working on the computer it is hard to see the letter and the color is just too much orange the only thing these glasses did was to separate me from approximately did not help my sleep whatsoever and i wore them hours before bed can't use them because they don't fit over my reading glasses perhaps i am misunderstanding blue light but after doing some research from several websites i e allaboutvision cvs blue light reviewofoptometry ce the lowdown on blue light good vs bad and its connection to amd preventblindness org blue light and your eyes i felt i had a pretty good idea of what to expect in a pair of blue light blocking glasses blue light is on the lower spectrum of visible light not quite in the uv ultraviolet but close please correct me if i'm wrong being visible light true blue light blocking lenses would leave you seeing a black or dark grey where the blue light should be this is a bit of a problem surfing the web as the links to other websites normally blue would be grey or black be difficult to easily recognize without hovering the mouse over the link from my research these are not blue light blocking glasses every piece of blue on a computer screen on an electronic led light on a pair of bluejeans in the sunlight comes through these glasses as blue the purpose for two stars is the disappointment in the advertising name of uvex skyper blue light blocking computer glasses when these are clearly not blue light blocking glasses my intention was to purchase blue light blocking glasses however i do give them two stars because first they are uvex which means quality secondly they can still be used as a decent pair of safety glasses when trimming trees shrubs cutting lumber etc ugly they are u g l y but i was willing to try them anyway based on their claim block nearly of blue light i really really hate the style though i feel ridiculous with them on too small when i opened the box i thought i received kid's glasses because the sides were so short they are adjustable but i was afraid i was going to break them in the process they don't fit over my prescription glasses which isn't a big deal because i'm nearsighted however if you are far sighted this could be a problem for you too dark perhaps they block blue light but so do my eyelids i feel i'm wearing sunglasses in the house the color is too dark and very distracting i can't imagine editing photos with these on or doing anything else where color is important bottom line i wish i could return these but i've already thrown away the packing i offered them to my husband but even he didn't want them and made a joke about me looking like a welder i guess my kids will get them for play glasses no use these really do block out the blue light however they are not the kind you can wear in front of regular eyeglasses my wife finds the led light to be unpleasant these were more unpleasant unfortunately these are workman safety glasses rather than computer glasses doesn't fit me at all don't fit well too clunky and crude to be practical for frequent or prolonged wearing nose piece is uncomfortable too small love the positive effect on enhancing ability to sleep however no instructions on how ro adjust temple length which is way roo short the shape of the glasses reflects light into my eyes it adds to eye strain this way if you flip the glasses backwards there is no light reflected into my eyes but glasses aren't made to wear backwards otherwise i suppose it would work fine the glasses are overall pretty uncomfortable though can't wear glasses under them either even my really small pair of prescription glasses won't go under them this is my third pair of computer glasses they all seem to last about a year before the lenses tint wear down and i liked the first two so much better they were cheapo glasses from amazon as well but this one is just a waste of money these do block light and make a huge difference in how things look outside during the daytime but they are made very cheaply i have no doubt these will be broken relatively soon unless i am extremely careful with them one wrong move is all it will take dumb product very low quality glasses arrived broken i forgot to return it does nothing for computer screen headache uncomfortable so i never wear them pretty weird color to see the world through bought a different pair with an extremely mild tint of yellow that i really like made to fit over glasses but don't so not very happy with them can't tell how good they work since they don't go over reading glasses they're good but they're only getting stars because the plastic nose ridges dug into my nose too much and left red marks this was fixed with cheap nose pads from wal mart update the nose pads did not work decided to go with spectra instead not a very secure fit one size does not fit all people am writing to the mfg and see if they can do something about it as i'm tired of it constantly sliding down my nose a bit too dorky in person vs on computer does a good job for the price but these glasses hurt my nose so much they have a sharp edge that i often can't wear them for more than an hour at a time was excited to try these blue light blocking glasses but they're uncomfortable on the bridge of my nose for my husband they didn't fit over his glasses hence we rarely wear them thought it would fit over prescription glasses but can t figure out how to adjust arms they're good but too tight on my head and cause headaches they need to make this more adjustable for different head sizes did not need it when i ordered the eyewear i did not take into consideration that we wear eyeglasses and the glasses do not fit over the eyeglasses we wear falls off my face and isn't all that comfy to wear but for the reviews and price this was the best option glasses are good but definitely not stylish i would go for one with a better style in the future this style is getting me made fun of in my household for looking too much like safety goggles love these glasses blocks blue light but makes you look like an electrician or construction worker fits a little tight around the ears might have to do with the weird angle of temple tip earpiece otherwise the product does as advertised at an affordable price it is good but not strong enough these work well enough at the very least i get drowsier more quickly when i wear them everything is orange and not helpful to me i lowered the bright setting on my computer by percent it helps polished interior surface combined with inadequate brow seating and cool curves cause internal reflection to actually obscure vision not enhance it very disappointed and would not recommend my face has not been that small since childhood with the arms extended all the way they are much too small cheap plastic wish i can give it a negative number these are not blue light blockers there'er just plan safety glasses who needs safety glasses for a computer really they're too small if you wear glasses if you don't wear glasses they're perfectly fine the quality of the lenses are top notch although the actual glass lenses and function are pretty nice the frame style unfortunately is not made for everyone it's designed more for narrow heads and big higher bridged noses if you are the type with a small bridge flatter nose and face like most asians these will end up with the glasses resting on your cheeks instead of your nose and the sides too tight in addition the sides do not extend far enough back a better design would have been to provide an adjustable removable nose bridge piece for low bridge noses and also allow the sides to extend farther back to accommodate a wider range of face styles as it was i had to give them away to a co worker since i simply could not wear them these are great for the blue light blocking but the frames are too heavy and i keep adjusting them all the time i gave up on these too they are sitting collecting dust by my computer maybe i can find another use for them well i tried using these but they're not exactly fun to wear despite my funny photo attached i have to wear reading glasses and putting these on top of them hasn't really been comfortable i tried for about nights to do this before bed but didn't notice a change i think i need to wear them for at least weeks straight an hour or before bed to see results i kind of wish i'd gotten ones that are a bit bigger meaning width wise i have a small face head and with reading glasses on these don't feel very comfortable anyway for the price they're worth a shot if i notice a change i'll write update my review they do block the blue light but there are extremely uncomfortable i am a women and the are extremely big they won't hold on your nose quality is great but thought these were for over my glasses also got super dizzy when wearing them outdoors i was told by a medical professional that if i wore these about hour before i go to sleep that it would help me to fall asleep faster since i use my computer before i go to bed it's neither here nor there in the beginning i thought it helped but honestly i don't think they do anything at all oh well i gave it a good try they are restful tho good buy design is good but fit not so good annoying behind ears not comfortable and fall off easy not actually a blue light blocking product for eye protection of debris only reported to amazon got a refund and didn't even have to send it back i wanted to see if these fit over my glasses better than swanwick brand and i also needed a pair for the car in case i forgot my swannies for evening i will keep these because the price was economical and they are good spares i will still use my swannies full time the earpieces on this pair dig slightly into my head not enough to take them off but still enough that i bear it worth mentioning this pair does fit more snuggly to my face whereas swannies are forever sliding down i have compared the two brands on their blue light blocking abilities and i believe the swannies to be much more effective these are better as a spare emergency pair if you are questioning these for helping you sleep and you can't afford swannies or don't want to part with all the cash that swanwick requires this is a good way to try and see if these alleviate your problems it is unbelievable to me that some plastic glasses can be the sleep solution i have been struggling to find for twenty years but believe you me tis the truth using these in the evening enables me to get to sleep faster and i think sleep better for this the uvex deserve stars however within months of sometime use blemishes have made looking through the the lens aggravating i am unable to completely clean the lens to restore the original clarity when not in use the uvex are kept in a glasses case i am looking for a more durable replacement even if i have to spend more bought two pair and didn't open one of them until weeks after i received them the pair i just opened is cracked there is no way to return them now what a waste of money the good news is my eyes are less tired using these at night the bad news is that they're really uncomfortable these were highly rated for blocking blue light but i'm going to have to find something more comfortable these are shop glasses intended for use in a production industrial setting not something one wears when around folks in a casual setting i will be exchanging them it does a good job blocking out the light fit was not good terrible design for going over glasses they pinch in the ear however they work and they were doctor recommended the yellow is to dark for me to see certain things on the computer i also bought them to fit over my glasses doesn't work sorry a waste of money if you wear presciption eye glasses will not fit over regular glasses another issue is where to return them fragile not comfortable and soft lens my guess is these serve a very specific and limited purpose with other work gear i will by something more comfortable and durable if i can find something reasonable priced blurry i was hoping they would fit over my glasses and they did not comfortably fit so i think they would be fine for anyone that did not need to wear prescription glasses to correct their vision in addition to the blue blocking glasses to big i never had eye discomfort until i began using a laptop about years ago before that i avoided cyberspace for the past few years i've been experiencing severe eye strain from spending too much time online i had high hopes that this product would live up to it's claims of helping to ease this problem unfortunately they didn't my eyes troubled me every bit as much after having worn them i finally had to cut down on the time i spent on my laptop especially at night my eyes feel much better as a result not fitting my face with bottom of lens touching my face uncomfortable i wish the glasses weren't so big ok tight fit over glasses if they fit at all the arms pull out but you need two people and it is difficult would work well if i didn't need reading glasses they're a bit too dark i bought these to cut out the blue light from my monitor and florescent lights so as to get my circadian rhythm back on track but they're really too dark to see my screen clearly but they fit well enough and i'll use them as safety glasses the glasses do reduce the blue light but not completely my disapointment is that they do not fit well over my perscription glasses it takes some force to fit these over my glasses which are small and rimless and because of the poor fit over my perscription glasses they do not fit up against my forehead or to the sides of my face so they do not block the blue light from the top or sides another disappointment is how these glasses alter the color of almost everything i was expecting them to just block the blue light not to alter my entire color spectrum so i ended up giving these glasses away i cannot wear them i am still looking for a good pair of blue light blocking glasses that will fit over my perscription glasses and to my face and not alter or minimally alter the rest of the color spectrum the arms are short and don't fit quite right great glasses a bit big for me that's all yes fine the adjustable arm is very stiff and difficult to pull out or push in so much force is needed to pull the adjustable arm out that the arm may be completely pulled out by accident the glasses are too heavy in the front and the adjustable arms must be adjusted tightly behind the ears to keep the glasses from sliding down the nose in turn adjusting the arms tightly behind the ears is very uncomfortable in my opinion there are similar glasses available on amazon that may be better useable but not recommended goggles do increase contrast just don't wear them in bright sunlight as the increased contrast becomes distracting and debilitating due to consequent eye strain nice for gray days low light etc why not more stars the goggles scratch really easily easier than dollar store sunglasses or dollar store goggles if you treat them really gently optic quality is very nice i initially got these so i could play on my game station later into the night without straining my eyes the lens works brilliantly it really does cut out a lot of blue light however i found that wearing them was very uncomfortable it didn't sit well on my ears pinched my nose and constantly kept slipping down my face i tried shortening the temples to see if that would help but to no avail comfort is important to me and these didn't fit the bill great glasses only bad thing is that the temple crushing comes loose and you can't glue them back while i like these glasses they seem well made they are way too small for me i gave them to my yr old daughter with an undersized head they fit fine even without my glasses on i can barley make them fit i do have a larger head but for glares made to fit over other lenses i feel these are way too small affordable blue light blockers don't see any improvement on my vision after month of continued use yet insanely hard af to play fps pc video games i will say this i have never never seen a lcd flicker the way after removing these after hours of use staring at my laptop screen looks like a camera filming a crt monitor yeah that bad purchased these to see if my eyes would improve my eyes get watery ez saw no improvement yet the quality is ok for price great for testing i do recommend these pc safety glasses if you need and or want to try out pc specific glasses to know whether or not it will work for you and improve eye strain eye dryness etc since they cheap when you are in a complete dark room using pc it does help but matching the light source in the room and monitor should not cause so much strain vs complete dark room and low monitor brightness using high brightness is a really really bad idea long term these help allot in compete darkness no debating that don't mind the style they are for home use maybe a month does not cut it need more time to see improvements it didn't work for me i haven't much of a bridge to my nose and the lenses hit the top of my cheeks they seem to block light effectively but they don't fit easily over my eyeglasses they are fine they are a bit difficult to fit over my reading glasses the light blocking feature is probably fine but i ordered these to wear them in the evening when watching tv i don't need to wear glasses for far vision but these glasses make the tv screen almost out of focus so that i can't use them for that purpose sigh this product was listed as a blue block for computers while it may work i find them uncomfortable for any length of time i do wish i had ordered a more traditional pair of glasses that were not this dark or tight on my head i also find they fog up i would say for me they are not the right product but they may work for you not bad they do the job of blocking blue light when viewing pc tablet phone screens but uncomfortable and makes everything on screen yellow but that's better than losing your eyesight the size doesn't fit my head well it's quite uncomfortable it's not blue light blocking either you can just put the glass under the light and you will see the light reflected is not blue the orange color makes it look like blue light blocking but actually does nothing the wrap around design at first seems to be highly functional but there is a problem when i am working in front of a pc i was recovering from a cold and had a mild fever the glasses steamed up and then i wanted to dry the glasses off but the instructions had a long list of precautions against wiping them off in a certain way which i could not remember so i wiped them off very gently but they kept on steaming up the over all problem with the glasses is that they appear to be durable industrial grade glasses when in fact they are very fragile another thing is that they are somewhat uncomfortable to where as i am wearing these glasses as i type this review i find that they do protect me from the high end blue rays that are given off by the computer screen as i tilt the glasses up and down i can notice a difference in the light rays from the screen so uncomfortable that i cannot wear them does not fit over perscription glasses great idea but place it over my eyeglasses and makes it slightly uncomfortable find the color annoying after awhile vision is fine but i really wanted them to fit over my glasses more comfortably not super comfortable not good if you wear glasses and it changes thte color of graphics bad for designers these do not fit over readers that makes them useless to me for computer work oh well if they just fit over my glasses i would give them five stars because of the safety glass design of the lenses they will not fit over another pair of glasses if you are a contact lens wearer these would be great is not good for reading from computer at all these don't help at all with night driving but maybe it would help driving in the rain at night i use these for viewing blueprints all day on my computer and they are unbelievably blurry if i'm trying to read but ok for viewing the black and white plans uncomfortable no space for eyelashes makes vision looks good came with smudges rather cheaply made and not very comfortable i would not purchase them again serve the purpose of blocking blue light well but these are one of the most uncomfortable glasses ive ever worn the arms of the frames are adjustable in length but these glasses are stiff and could use a frame redesign for comfort i recommend looking at other more expenaive options with rubber nose pieces probably it is my fault for choosing it the strong yellow tint is too much for me does not fit over my glasses i wanted to wear them over my glasses they did not fit these were defective there is a movable adjustable stem but it was stuck on one side i prefer the regular safety uvex for night reading they are more comfortable and easily fit over your reading glasses these glasses did not fit my face well but they did fit my husband we have not used them much but they seem to work well at blocking blue light colors will be altered by the tint of the lenses so they can be problematic for working on computers and cell phones if color is important to what you are doing these glasses made me feel sick to look through them they had a wavy look through the lenses trashed them i am disappointed because i thought these would fit over my prescription glasses they don't they also make everything look just a bit too yellow when i put them on the glare from my computer actually hurt my eyes maybe it's me but i cannot wear them i thought the computer screen would be better to look at but it was not surprisingly flimsy and cheaply done seem to work good for viewing but one ear loop will not adjust and it's too small to fit now it's unuseable too yellow distorts colors too small bows too short not a good fit for smaller faces nor would they work if you wear glasses did not like returned these actually hurt my eyes when i wear them i can't use them these glasses are fine the biggest problem i have with them is that they are curved as to block side light not sure how much gets in through the side anyway the curvature creates a lot of contact on my cheeks i am frequently needing to wipe the smudges off this company makes a flatter pair which i did not see when i originally bought them for the price they are good expect that colors will be changed when you are watching a video or just looking at photos blocks out light but slightly distorted they are a bit wide for me personally too small for me it wears tight and impinging on my face leaving marks below the eyes make things hella yellow i don't know if these really help or not it is a bit uncomfortable to use while i'm on the computer i haven't noticed any difference in my insomnia issues but i don't think my insomnia is caused by my computer's 'blue' light i've had insomnia for years even before i used my computer late at night so i really can't give an accurate rating i just don't know uncomfy and not work for me very small doesn't work for me these appear to simply be orange safety glasses they're not entirely uncomfortable i've only really felt any sort of benefit to using these when typing out long papers they definitely make staring at a monitor for hours a lot more bearable offices should probably give these out to their employees still i'm not sure why they're bucks the only problem but a very significant one is that these glasses don't cover the forehead and that allows the pineal gland to still be stimulated through the porous bone of the forehead they also don't seal well around the sides the lens is high quality according to consumer reports and blocks virtually all blue light but if light is still striking the forehead the effect will be diminished ideally they'd make these in goggle form too good product but ear frame is uncomfortable for me to small made for a kid i purchase these because i already wear glasses for my vision problems and thought they would easily wrap around or over lap my eye glasses they don't even after taking my eye glasses off and putting these on the ear handles barely make it to cover my ears they seem to work very well to eliminate the blue light however very poorly designed i am keeping them just to prevent my vision from being harmed further but for those who require wearing eye glasses don't buy this particular product if the manufacturer or seller has a solution they can contact me and i will change this review but for now this is really the first negative review i have had to give on amazon the persimmon color is almost too much would spend the extra money next time and buy a pair of blue blockers with less tint to the lenses zero star didn't fit and even amazon didn't want it back these kept falling off i subsequently ordered these clip on glasses cyxus blue light filter clip on computer glasses uv blocking anti eye strain unisex reading eyewear standard size both my husband i are very pleased with the clip on glasses these were not for me i have gotten no feedback i do not like the change of color that this glasses have uncomfy do not fit over any type of glasses and sit too close to face jusr okay fit very poorly despite extending the frame as far back as it goes it barely hooks around my ears my head isn't especially large the lenses to appear to block blue light but as mentioned the glasses don't fit well i also don't recommend these if you already wear prescription glasses as it causes discomfort definitely not useful for normal day to day computer use not what i thought i was getting so i returned them distortion of the image due to the curvature causing some sort of astigmatism the lenses cannot be used over your regular glasses the arms are two short might cut down on glare but everything is blurry cab t read with them on they were too dark for the computer monitor these glasses are advertised as non magnifying upon purchase i found them to be magnifying to a small degree resulting in eyestrain and headache i have perfect vision i had my friends with good vision try them and they also claimed they magnified i am going to ask amazon for a refund as they are falsely advertised as non magnifying branch of these glasses are too short low level finish pass on this junk lenses are cheap and useless they serve their purpose though they don't fit well over my glasses which i unfortunately have to wear in order to see my computer phone or ipad good thing i'm not aiming for fashion these glasses make text on both books and computer phone screens look blurry rendering them worthless i have a laptop with exceptionally high resolution constrast and definition a macbook pro with retina display which makes even small text look clear and sharp i'm also near sighted and when i take out my contact lenses at night i can see extremely well at close range about cm to cm but when i put on these glasses everything's a blur the blurriness is very disappointing because the glasses do a wonderful job at screening out blue light and i found that the change in light did indeed help with my insomnia having encountered a number of products that seem to be based on scientific principles that make sense but then nevertheless fail to work i was skeptical about whether blocking blue light would actually be effective perhaps it was placebo effect but i found that putting on these glasses made the light look as if it was just at sunset and immediately gave me the relaxed feeling of sitting and reading on a back porch on a summer evening and instead of feeling wide awake energetic and motivated to get things done 'til am the relaxed feeling soon turned to sleepiness and i'd fall asleep by pm to midnight that was wonderful and whether placebo effect or not i'd take it but the blurriness had me craning my neck forward and squinting my eyes in order to read text i found this too unpleasant neck pain eye muscle fatigue to continue using the glasses i'm giving the product two stars only because it fulfilled its primary claim of blocking blue light but arguably it deserves only one star because the blurriness rendered it useless to me i'm now searching for a better pair of blue light blocking glasses i bought them because i thought they would fit over my reading glasses they do not but they are good in the truck for night driving they are a bit flimsy and not sturdy but good for night time vision uncomfortable and not worth the trouble i wear glasses when i read and these did not fit well over them but worse was the quality of the plastic not very high in my opinion the idea seemed good and when i could stand using them it was easier on my eyes but using them long term with such poor plastic is probably not a good idea best blue blocking glasses for safety not optical grade you can not wear these all the time unless you want eye strain they distort your vision which is such a pain im looking for a pair of glasses that has the same blue block capabilities but is optical grade meant for all day use can't use as they won't fit over my glasses it's my own fault for just going by the picture but they look large as it is it's a bit of a tight fit even without my glasses on a great design however they were too big if you are an average size they work otherwise if one is petite they do not stay on the head well this are just labeled safety glasses and are uncomfortable these are big lenses they cover my entire field of vision the issue i have with them is that the nose section is too wide for my nose to keep the lenses up off of my cheeks so they dig into my cheeks it gets to be a pain if you need to wear them for an extended period of time keep sliding off my my face there are better options available don't get these ones they don't work very well to work on the computer i believe these glasses do what they are supposed to in terms of blocking out the blue light on a computer but i find them very dark and if i wear them for a period of time my eyes take some time to readjust i do screen and paper work and i find myself taking them off to see the writing on the paper and then putting them back on to look at the screen i like just little heavy for my face but feels a good relieve to my eyes i bought these to use in a laboratory setting as filter goggles to block out a specific wavelength of blue light the wavelength was within the specified range of the goggles but in reality they did not work these do the job they filter but they are too big for me and they don't fit over my reading glasses i got a pair of reading glasses that look normal and are a little less orange filter and they magnify at times these are shaped more like safety glasses my gf likes them though did not help at all these are very tight fitting and not going to work for us at all i tried these glasses and they slightly distort text on my monitor making it too hard to read so i am returning them which is always a hassle too yellow color can't see anything clear hard to see colors but they work well for eye strain way too big i don't know whether these actually work because they're too difficult to wear i already wear glasses and these are definitely not designed to be worn with another pair of glasses they might look like they're big enough to fit over other glasses but but they're not it's ok but i am not using it often its just a pair of safety glasses there is optical distortion in the part of the lens close to the upper center that causes a blurring of words i found it bothered me so i decided to use them for watching a movie normally i don't have eye strain from movies but wearing these glasses to watch a movie on my computer did cause eyestrain so i will use them when i use my chainsaw i wish i returned these when i had the chance do not waist your money as i did i went with eyekepper spring hinges uv protection anti glare anti blue rays scratch resistant lens computer reading glasses readers they are perfect enough tint to block the blue light plus reader lenses as for uvex first the arms are too short to reach your ears second they fog up third they are too dark you strain your eyes using them for computer readers i use the huge imac and its too visually restrictive i can feel the strain in my eyes fourth if you wear reading glasses they will not work as an over lay as my wife will attest to very dissappointed they came so highly recommended by a speaker at the truth about cancer weekend in tx i just lost all respect for that speaker they fit too tight on my head and can give me a headache because of that so make sure you have a narrow head it doesn't fit around my face comfortably and i can't wear glasses under it otherwise it does an okay job fit a little big for a ladies head cant clean stain easily they work but how they work is they make things really dark unlike other blue light glasses which give the yellowing effect these are more super dark orange effect but with that in mind they do what they say these fit well but it is hard getting used to everything yellow even on the computer for which they were purchased maybe useful elsewhere found a download to get a yellow screen on my computer monitor which is very helpful called iris that is far better very painful behind the ears during wearing it earpieces at the end are very rough causing that pain awkward to wear still see glare from tv they are way to small and hurt my head to wear them they made the ends of them out of a nice soft rubber but made the part that presses against the veins on ur head this cheap hard plastic that cant be dipped in boiling water and adjusted i tried heating them with a lighter and bending them it helped a little but the type of plastic that its made out of bubbled up and got deformed from the heat they also make white light coming in from windows hurt your eyes ive gotten a headache every time that i have used them these are not optically sound glasses they should not be worn for elongated viewing times for most people instant headache when putting these on they have an element of distortion magnification even on the magnification glasses something about the color of the plastic while it does cut out blue light it amplifies the lower frequencies of light making everything brighter than it normally would be without the glasses these should never be worn for reading or computer use maybe safety glasses at best spend an extra and get a better product they are uncomfortable to werar too tight a fit for my big head other than that great product uncomfortable and gives me headaches wouldn't recommend for watching tv or playing video games if you care about colors but for being on your cellphone reading or just browsing i do recommend i just can't get used to these they sit on my cheeks and feel very heavy and they push against my forehead i thought if i wore them for awhile those areas would get used to the pressure however no matter how i position them they hurt that said my eyes feel so much better so i will certainly pursue a frame that is less intrusive on my poor face o i bought these glasses a few months ago they definitely neutralize all of the blue light from all sources and it turns into more a gray ish color i am giving them stars because they are bit large and hurt my ears after wearing them for an hour or too my nose has a skinny bridge and the nose piece is not adjustable so they fall to the tip of my nose and then off very frustrating otherwise they would be okay these glasses do a nice job of relieving eye strain when i'm reading at length on my kindle however the bend in the lenses are not right for my face i would have been better off with a tradional eye glass look rather than a wrap around the wrap around causes its own kind of strain when i focus if you are used to wrap around these will be fine not what i was looking for i had hoped these would fit over my prescription glasses but they don't my fault not the manufacturer's these glasses do indeed block blue light they just aren't very comfortable the length and angle of the arms is adjustable but the glasses are always slipping down my nose or putting too much pressure on my ears for under i suppose you can't expect much though one plus is that they work as a drug free form of birth control they are ok but they fit terribly on my head being of intense irish descent i have a very round head and low set ears and nose even after adjusting them all over the place this makes them constantly fall down i wish they had some sort of adjustable nose bridge thingies like regular glasses if they did i'd give them a i noticed that the first few times i wore them i actually fell asleep while working on the pc too much vin diesel triple x but ok safety glasses so they are bulky image clarity not the greatest my eyelashes touch the lens would give it stars but for the price works well when i have to rotate back to days glasses to dark to see computer i'm only rating these a because i can't wear them due to making my face warm they sit right on top of the cheeks with no room for them to breathe i went with another pair that were with just a tint of yellow and look just like regular glasses that i rated star ok the temple tips are very uncomfortable at times when pressure is applied upon the earlobes cheap construction un smoothed outer cupped sharp edges like something it missing useful for cutting glare and eye strain but width of frame too large might possibly fit over normal glasses too small and ordered only refunded money for one i need to wear glasses to read the computer screen these glasses are more or less flat across the face but these orange computer glasses are highly curved making it difficult to wear them over the other glasses that's my only complaint jgmac haven't had sufficient time to test but so far so good terrible to use dark and unpleasant these are ok but if you need glasses for close up reading then these are not good tried wearing them over my readers uh no guess there ok in general or if you wear contacts but if you need eye correction these are not effective mercy me man do these things block out the bluelight they knock out so much it feels strange wearing them everything has a orange cast the clarity in my opinion for reading is not that great kinda blurry when looking through them another thing i do not like is my eyelashes rub against the front lens when i blink i find this very annoying so for computer glasses its a no go however for safety glasses they would be fine i was hoping this would reduce my eyestrain it didn't great value except that i need readers for my ipad viewing cannot read mail unless i put my readers over the glasses not easy to do do not fit over prescription glasses sorry but they were useless i gave them away they are too large for my head and keep slipping down my face they are really more like safety glasses and can scratch easy and the plastic can distort your vision a little i'm going to try and find a more glasses like pair that fits me better these are just too large they're orange glasses not super impressed just use flux or something and don't watch tv at night or save your money and read a book quality is a little flimsy i got these to try for blue light blocking at night not sure yet how well they are helping but i like to think they are and they were affordable to try it out would definitely break easily though have to be somewhat careful with them if u get a wide face trust me dont buy this i prefer the normal model like glasses this one is too big specially on the nose great glasses but the ear part does not go far enough back as a result the bent part of the plastic sits on top of my ears i apparently have ears that are set further back on my head than average but i wish these could have at least extended further back than they do disappointed they're bulky heavy and too big for my head overall very uncomfortable to wear and i find myself not wearing them for these reasons not recommended not the greatest fit but completely covers the field of vision and amazing price pros comfort in screen viewing cons i haven't notice any improvement in regulating sleep rhythms they are very large for me falling off my face the glasses is good the only thing i have to complain about is that i paid more tax than charged in brazil and did not get return than paid more not suitable for computer reading due to too orange brownish yellowish lose the color of pc screen all colors are seen close to orange due to the same issue so in low light hard to read well content on pc screen especially in the evening night tested in daytime same problem even better than evening night too curved so content not in the center are distorted not good for computer reading may be good for outdoor activities in bright light just okay they work but not exactly very pleasing to look at i've found that it kept sliding down my face does not sit properly they are small fit would be better for young child not what i thought it would be would not buy it again don't buy unless you want a headache i think these are a bit deceptively marketed these are work and safety glasses plain and simple they cover way too much of the face to comfortably use for prolonged reading or lcd work somebody just re marketed these as computer glasses because that is popular right now no adjustments possible everything is plastic with no wires so nothing to bend the optical quality is also questionable there are some distortions i think trying to use these for prolonged reading is a bad idea i've heard a lot about controlling blue light in the evening i'm not sure if these are having the desired effect yet i e i can get to sleep sooner and experience more quality sleep a bit heavy feeling the lenses are not really clear crisp enough for comfortable prolonged computer use i had wanted them to counteract the computer screen glare in the evening hours just too uncomfortable to use consistently don't know if it helps block blue light as dr mercola says don't like the deep orange coloring distorts the natural colors too strongly good at blocking the blue light but they are large and sit very low on my cheeks kind of digging in which gets uncomfortable not quite what i expected but i can use them for shooting protection so no harm these are like goggles they're kind of heavy not that comfortable for long term use shipped quickly don't know if it's working for me because i may have other sleep issues the lenses are not likely to stay in the frames because of design i have to be careful to place them carefully on my head i suppose for the price they may yet prove to be valuable i simply need more time to evaluate fred they fog up the moment you put them on and stay fogged up unwearable these are just safety glasses with orange lens did not help at all with concussion symptoms when using the computer sorry these really distort your vision they are not optical quality lenses guess you get what you pay for too yellowish i tried it but will not use it again it bothers me will look for another alternative these glasses makes everything non color and removes the colors and there is no way to compare a regular computer screen than from the one peering through these glasses a good price for cheap sunglasses and safety glasses but being touted for pc glasses is a real stretch earlwallace i don't know how are they supposed to work i get a headache from wearing this don't know if it's my problem or the glasses problem they're nice but you should be cautious when driving because you cannot easily see the color of traffic lights it would be too easy to miss a signal which could ruin your whole day they'd be fine on the highway or other non automative uses i purchased these to filter blue light out before bedtime so i can sleep better they do filter the light in a way that makes things clearer and that's kind of neat but the product did not filter light in a way that helped me sleep i picked up my maui jim sunglasses and started wearing them for an hour or two before i go to sleep instead i also ordered some red cellophane and made covers with a double layer of this for my devices i have also covered up bright appliance lights around the house with dark tape i can still see the light come through but it's much reduced i have purchased red wraparound lenses from uvex in the past i think they worked better for the purpose of pre bedtime light filtering than this product also with the red ones you can wear your regular eye glasses over them i couldn't do that with these they are so small they will not fit behind my ears are they a children's eyeglass certainly not for the average american adult head very very disappointed in this product this product is identical to the uvex s x skyper safety eyewear black frame sct orange uv they are marketed as two different things one sold as blue light blocking and the other not they are the same this is misleading the reviews for this product mislead me to try them i wanted a lower price alternative to gunnar computer glasses but these aren't even close they are big and bulky and far lower quality the lenses are good of course but they fit poorly constantly slide downward and are very uncomfortable the lenses rest on the center of the cheek and leave a sharp imprint rather than resting on the bridge of the nose blue blockers are very effective in all artificial light but they need to be comfortable cannot be used in an office environment trying to read on a computer screen well perhaps not surprisingly everything is orange when viewed through these glasses they only block blue light if you can stand to wear them i couldn't i don't like the way they curve like goggles i can't wear them over my glasses unrealistic who is going to put these on and see in orange every time they use their device good idea but not implemented well i like the idea of blocking the blue light from ipad and iphone screens but i hate the distortion of color i ordered these glasses based on the recommendation of an acupuncturist i honestly have not used them nightly to notice a difference in a better sleep pattern due to using them main reason is the glasses are too bulky and takes time to get used to if over time i use them more often and have an update will surely post it these glasses definitely cut down on the amount of blue light from my computer screen but they don't really fit well over my prescription glasses they don't provide as much relief from eyestrain as i'd hoped thought i could wear it over my reading glasses nope so had to return unfortunately they didn't fit over my regular glasses glasses were too dark for my wife to use for the tv or computer i tried them and they would not fit over my glasses too early to tell of any benefits they don't block out as much blue light as i'd hoped but they do help i received this as a gift from a friend and used it exactly as directed i have had multiple broken bones nerve damage and several other issues serving my country so when i got this i was excited wrong this is a complete ripoff scam do not waste your money on this they're ok i suppose if you like looking at everything around you in orange all day long it does do the job in protecting your eyes from computer work all day long but i prefer a nice yellow tint as the orange became very annoying after a few hours it blocks out the blue light it is to bi not sure why but i get headaches wearing these bought these for use while mountain biking on singletrack trails in the woods the orange color makes things clearer and not darker light normal sunglasses which can make it too dark when under the cover of thick trees they fit fairly well and are comfortable the orange color gives an orange yellow tint that you don't get used to meaning you always see it it's not terrible but i swear i had red glasses like these before and the red disappeared you didn't notice a red tint after awhile so i'm going to try red next i rated stars not because there was really anything wrong they are what i expected for glasses i found that they got scuffed quite easily so store them carefully after week they got very badly scuffed when i wasn't super careful about storing them so they had to be thrown away these are regular safety glasses nothing in the packaging states that these are computer glasses or are made to use as computer glasses the tiny picture under the product pictures states that dental staff could use them when working with blue light that is emitted from dental equipment lightweight comfortable effective in blue light reduction but flimsy and not sturdy and rigid as expected these glasses are cheap plastic and the quality of the lens is not very good it was very hard to read off my computer as the letters all were blurry making these glasses worthless for the intended purpose i have a light issue and fluorescent lights tend to hurt my eyes so i had hoped this would be a fix based on other reviews unfortunately not if these blue blocker lens' actually worked i would have purchased a better pair of glass lens' that actually looked descent these make you look like someone that should not be working in an office environment bottom line pass i bought these because supposedly blocking blue light at night helps prevent insomnia as far as i can tell these made zero difference for me but they are comfortable and could serve as sunglasses in a pinch or safety glasses for outdoor work on a bright day pros blocks blue light completely for a very low price cons it's not very comfortable to wear even though it has some good adjustable functions due to its nose pad they were not very clear and not sure if they were actually blocking what i got them for awful i felt like life was distorted when i tried them on can't very well use these with only one ear piece very disappointed stiff to wear this works to reduce eyestrain from too much computer use it fit me fine there is a trivial amount of distortion i think more expensive ones would work better but this is the only pair i have tried so i rated it in the middle too big i got these for reading my kindle in the evenings the quality of the lens is so poor that they just are not working i tried fitting reading glasses under them to hopefully improve the quality of the vision but they just didn't fit i would recommend these only for safety goggles when quality vision is not required too dark for tv tight fit i should have ordered the flip down up model a lot of the games i play have a fair amount of orange in the ui user interface or the general color spectrum so this wasn't the best product for me plus it felt more like a pair of shooting glasses than something honestly it'll pay off to spend a bit more and get legitimate gaming glasses a littlw too dark for me the glasses are lucky if they fit a child's head very disappointed can't wear it over my prescription glasses just way too narrow and small and i do need prescription glasses to watch tv and or work at my computer seems to be manufactured for children's heads yup very bulky the glasses don't fit me very well they're okay for what i am using them for i bought these specifically to block out blue light from electronics and the breaking dawn i read a review from consumerreports i think that said these blocked the most blue light at something like is blocked i work nightshift until am and don't get home until usually in the summer it's already getting light outside even if the sun isn't quite up i thought wearing these on the drive home would make it easier to fall asleep so far they haven't made a marked difference in sleeping but i guess they aren't hurting i should probably wear them at work for the last hour or two of my shift but i can't quite bring myself to wear such goofy glasses in front of people haha they are difficult to adjust to and i would suggest wearing them while sitting still for a day or two before trying to work or drive in them they were disorienting for me to drive in when i first put them on and they actually seemed to give me a bit of a headache they are a dark orange so it does make it more difficult to drive when it's still sort of dark out as soon as it starts to lighten up though they make things a little more defined i guess just be careful i am using the light but i am not sure how effective it is as an example my head is usually harder to fit with glasses hats etc i'm female but must have a big head lol these glasses were actually loose on me and got looser with each use no fun having to constantly press them back on to my face would be a great product if they weren't so massive it's ok i got these glasses because of a very impressive video review i found here where the guy did a comparison of these glasses with a well known but much more expensive brand used for the same purpose don't get me wrong i didn't give these glasses stars because they are poor quality and i can't test the blue blocking ability either way so it doesn't have to do with that either but for what i got them for to block blue light from my hdtv and varying devices stars was too much since because they are darkish orange i won't be using them at all the day after i ordered them i found an app that blocks blue light called f lux it works on windows android mac and iphone and can be customized so you can vary the degree of blue blocking while adjusting to the now yellowish hue coming from your device screen i do not think this is a true blue blocker this does not fit my face at all they may fit better on someone with a bigger nose and a less flat face the main points of contact between these glasses and my face are the lenses hitting my cheekbones rather than the nose piece on the bridge of my nose didnt help me with sleep and made me nauseous when i wore them as a light comfortable blue light blocker these are fine however if you don't have a very large head these are going to fall off your face i'm not a small woman ' and i don't have a very small head but these are meant to be worn by a man with a very large head i solved this issue by tying an elastic around the arms of the glasses but they still don't even block out all of the surrounding light these are ideal for people with larger heads or access to elastic and who use their phone before sleep not someone who puts them on at sunset and continues on with their day hoping to not get blue light in their eyes major defect the arms don't reach my ears if i put them on over my glasses strangely the arms can be extended but with my glasses on they are an inch too short i tried them with my glasses off and they're still too short the curved part of the arms cut into my ears i've worn glasses all my life and easily fit the store bought kind from drugstores my head dimensions are about average for a human being recommendation if your ears are located on your temples these may work if your anatomy is average however find another brand i bought this to help me sleep unfortunately it did nothing for me ok it works ok but is a bit big for my face a little bit big for me the result is ok to my eyes it's just ok for me to watch tv to protect my eyes at night not bad for the price but may want to buy a few as they do scratch very easily they do wrap around and give better protection than most safety glasses but don't last too long before being scratched on site blocks blue light but for me it slides down my face easily i wouldn't say i have a small nose either in conclusion one size does not fit all when it comes to glasses made everything way too orange also seemed like a film was on it very cloudy i gave them to my husband if only these had adjustable nosepieces they'd be perfect i'm a female with a small nose apparently and these constantly slide down my face finally i put some sticky tack on the nose area and now they stay up they are what i would rate as fair i have and use similar computer design glasses but one flaw in these is it doesn't read colors like red or orange well and should come in varying vision levels but they do the job at keeping your eyes from becoming stressed or tired i decided to try these glasses after hearing of the benefits people swear by however the glasses sit heavy kept sliding down my nose i can't wear them over small reading glasses unlike a few reviews suggested and significantly distorts everything you see to deep orange i tried it on one night for hours before going to sleep but for an unknown reason i actually ended up having trouble sleeping that night needless to say i'm a bit disappointed and i don't see myself trying these again bad fit for a regular size man gave to my mother ok but i don't use them i got them to eliminate blue light as a way that is said to enhance sleep doesn't seem to make much difference in length of time i sleep but might try it again they sure do change the way tv looks these are fairly comfortable and include the safety feature so other uses may occur they are certainly well priced i bought these glasses to protect my eyes from the computer uv from the day i bought this item till today it's been doing its job but it is not scratch proof beware i just cleaned with a cloth strap and it dropped to the floor i took it a lil bit roughly and it scratched a lil bit it does it job blocking uv u will see orange and u wont get most blue color of it so be ready overall good item you can wear them over prescription glasses super easy to scratch up could not understand the instructions for sizing and also not comfortable being fit over eyeglasses i just hope the product blocks the blue spectrum rays as it advertises hurts my nose not comfortable to wear i thought these would fit over my glasses since my glasses head are small but they are not comfortable the temples seem tight as well sometimes i use over the ear headphones then they are really uncomfortable i replaced them with some clip on blue blockers i bought these because of the anti blue light feature which as i understood it could help with insomnia by blocking the blue light from electronics such as tv computer etc they did not help my insomnia at all probably my insomnia is not from blue light they may be useful for other purposes but unfortunately not for mine have only used twice but like them so far yes it does block blue light no you can't put over regular glasses and no i'm not sure they actually helped me too small for my head it has adjustable legs but not adequate not large enough to fit over my glasses using to cut out blue light from tv to help with sleep haven't noticed any difference bought some cheaper versions that worked better the glasses do what they are intended to do but after minutes or so the lack of nose padding makes them virtually unwearable the world is bright orange with these glasses i returned them because the color was so intense too much for me the uvex skyper safety eyewear orange lenses are fine no complaint and these glasses are probably okay for most wearers who do not need to also wear prescription glasses however i find the product is ill suited to wear in front of prescription glasses because they are bulky and the short length of the rigid ear pieces make for a tight uncomfortable fit they did not work for me proceed with caution hard to wear over prescription glasses but will keep trying supposed to cut down on awake rays from electronics was not what i expected as to fit needed type that fits comfortably over regular glasses these are very uncomfortable and difficult to use ya they worked fine basically a safety glass item not regular sunglasses i expected them to be suitable to wear with glasses this is not the case i tried to make them usable without success i am not sure they are doing the job they are designed for too big for my woman's medium sized face so hard to wear it is protect against blue screen but when i am reading text on computor it is not so clear ended up not using them much didn't seem to make much difference but i think the bruhaha about blue screens is way over hyped doesn't fit easily over eyeglasses these glasses definitely do the trick if you wear them in the evening before bedtime they apparently block out the blue light from tv or ipad i noticed that i got sleepy quicker after wearing them a few hours at night one complaint for me is that they are too big i have a small face and so if i look down they fall off also the part that goes over your ear is a bit sharp and sometimes causes discomfort recommended by consumer reports for counteracting the effects of digital screen displays i'm still seeing how it works for me but it is well made at a decent price does not fit standard drawer looks sturdy and would have been perfect however it did not come with the drawer as shown in the listing i recieved this item slightly dented and missing the drawer i love this caddy it's well made all the welds seem right but the drawer was missing which is a big deal after diving into the other reviews more i see i am not alone now i have to box it up print a label and go to the ups store to return it huge hassle for a item bad attention to detail the rolodex tag is crooked and the drawer's front is misshapen the drawer doesn't sit flush in its slot poor quality purchased at office depot very nice a roomy but too tall for my drawer i had to return it i bought this for the standing file slots the item is much smaller than i was expecting won't file much too small read the fine print for size dimensions i didn't bent on arrival but does the trick mesh came broken and entire business card holder is a little bent out of shape i really wanted to like this product but nothing is symmetrical aligned straight etc fortunately it wasn t really expensive so it s not worth the hassle of returning fyi there s a similar product from amazon basics that will probably contructed much better the description says inches long but it's actually a hair over or as is said elsewhere might be the interior dimensions or they may have changed the spec also the little tray insert is made of cheap plastic think a recyclable yogurt cup but thinner material not something robust you could easily remove without spilling its contents otherwise it's pretty well made came damaged to my home the welding job on this product was terrible there are gaps all over the place because the product was welded together crooked kind of chincy feeling fits in a top desk drawer wasn t properly made bent out of shape still holds things just wish it was even the product arrived with the center drawer compartment missing from it the compartments aren't even straight damaged item for something so simple as a business card holder i was surprised disappointed cheaply made and the bends were not made in the correct place so it was majorly off from the start i bent it enough that it will hold cards but rocks back and forth on my desk with the slightest touch i would bend it more but it starts to make a popping sound as if it is ready to break will not buy again and will most likely find another one somewhere else not as pictured shows rounded corners for all edges one corner on the right side was a sharp cutout right angle sloping to a rounded corner it is smoothed so the machine cutting was wrong very disappointed in workmanship and quality simple and works for holding my business cards on my desk the price is reasonable as well it was damaged bent when it arrived so it doesn't sit flat it seems like a sturdy product so not sure how that would have happened it's still functional though and it wouldn't be worth it for me to repackage and ship it back to amazon so i'll keep it with the bent side towards the back it's fine for what it is but mine came bent still usable but not ideal very heavy item came damaged with a giant dent on the bottom of the organizer will be returning this time all the ones i ordered paint was chipping off shows that it comes with a drawer but mine did not was slightly too large for the drawer i used it do but i managed to squeeze it in upon receiving my rolodex mesh oval supply caddy i noticed that the center drawer was missing seems to be a common problem with this item even with the drawer missing it still makes a great entertainment remote caddy https www amazon com dp b jz sc ref cm cr ryp prd ttl sol poor product cheap waste of money it's smaller than i though it would be i can still use it just not as originally intended wish it were x bigger product not as advertised don't waste your money seller did not include the x slide out drawer cannot find the drawer separately here and it's another at my local staple so i am paying double without the drawer it's much less useful the unit itself is great but the drawer unit isn't all that great it just fits in an opening and is not on rails which means it tends to want to fall out this product would be great or someone who thrives in organization that sadly isn't me so it ended up sitting as a peice of clutter on my already cluttered desk so is the life of e best e arrived with a huge dent and the entire thing was lopsided like a parallelogram with round ends when viewed from the top very disappointed not sure whose fault it was but i returned it immediately i actually bought of these as inexpensive cell phone holders for around my home office kitchen vanity they work well for this purpose so for that i would say stars they perform as expected however since i ordered a number of them i can say that the manufacturing quality is inconsistent the product is made poorly the metal must not have gone through the bending machine properly because the stand is basically at a diagonal surprised they shipped this to me they're too cheap to be worth my time to return just won't buy them again it works just fine but mine came with kinks in it probably from improper handling mine was a little crooked and i don't just mean the two tabs to hold mail like the entire thing sits a little skewed this surprised me because it had the rolodex label tag on it and they're generally known for decent product right i don't know it's usable but a little crooked the first one i ordered had the mesh broken so i returned it only to get another that had no little drawer at all just open space where there should be a drawer i don't even know what is going on with my refund status will not buy again mine shipped without the little drawer for the bottom it really doesn't look right on my desk without that piece it arrived without the drawer the drawer was not inlcuded in my package came bent no drawer bins this same exact product brand and all is at the dollar store i was expecting it to be larger i did not pay close enough attention to the measurements my fault awkward design very small will hold a few pens and small letters drawer was missing the product was missing the draw compartment received it damage i repurchase it at a low price however i am yet to receive it its ok too small it is perfect to put on your desk to save space the little pull out is perfect for sticky notes got this in the mail today and the drawer is missing annoying and a nuisance wish i could get get what i ordered the product information did not make it clear that this was a deep desk organizer and so it did not fit in my drawer had i known it was deep i would not have bought it my business cards don't fit properly in this it needed to be slightly longer so the cards fit neatly between the edges works for me way too big my fault for not reviewing the dimensions before ordering it but this thing could easily fill a large kitchen drawer wasn't worth sending back since it was my fault for ordering it but it's now occupying a place in my closet and i will likely never use it i really wanted to like this and overall it seems decent i would've given it five stars but it came without the drawer compartment seeing as i purchased this strictly for makeup that drawer was integral to my storage plans i ordered multiple things and searched every box that came but there's no little drawer to be found seriously frustrating mine arrived somewhat bent all around after a little elbow grease i bent it back to original shape and it sat flat on my desk well made but quite a bit smaller than i expected guess i should have paid attention to the measurements item showed up without the drawer as pictured it was what i expected this business card rack is made of very sturdy black coated metal it is attractive affordable and functional it can be used as a phone stand too it works great to hold the phone in the kitchen keeping it off the counter and safe from food and liquid while on the counter looking carefully at the construction it is sloppy because it was rolodex brand i anticipated it to be better made the first one i received was lopsided so a little rocky from side to side i tried to bend it back but because the metal is so strong it was impossible i received a replacement which is level for the price this is a good value and useful item even if a little crooked it looks professional on the desk or on a trade show display table i enjoy reviewing and i too rely on other people's reviews for my buying decisions i believe that legitimate reviews are invaluable to buyers if you found this review helpful please click yes below if my opinion changes at any time i will update this review awesome for work area nice looking desktop organizer pros cheap and looks nice cons the bottom isn't made well so it's uneven i had to pull off and relocate the rubber footpads so that the thing would sit flat and not slide around the table it's also a bit short so i can't clip pens onto the rim nice works but the heads of the stylus are trash and they cost to replace the little caddy is a nice size and seems sturdy however it showed up without the drawer that goes in the middle i read the q a post about this and wasn't even worried about not getting the drawer what the heck now it looks like a weird empty space things fall out of i am truly disappointed granted this is not an expensive item but there must be zero quality control the little welds between the mesh on this unit were all out of place this also causes the little drawer to be unable to fully slide in unless you lift it up the unit sits completely crooked despite the rubber feet on the bottom since a few of the joints stick out so far below the rest this is not a damage issue but a poor construction issue honestly i would be very hesitant to buy something like this online again it's something so simple to see for yourself in a store this is a very well made product our desks get very organized after we have them however shipping was not so good we scheduled this order to be delivered on the next monday but the box was left outside the office on the street on saturday we were lucky that one of our partner went to work on that saturday and took them inside the office on time otherwise it could got lost the metal organizers were stacked together without a good protection got dented too big and rigid for my drawer although that's really more my fault just realize it has zero give so you won't be able to fit it into tighter spaces what happened to the product it had rust when it came i tried to wipe it off but some parts can't be helped the caddy arrived without the large front compartment it's still somewhat usable and returning it is a hassle so just a heads up you might get missing parts if you order this product so be ready to have to deal with returns replacements the 'welds' are not even close to straight but they are solid i like the layout but it looks like the assembly was done without much pride it does what it's supposed to good too wide for most drawers good product its small it would be great if its a bit bigger is dimensions it was missing the drawer unbelievable so many times the product is smaller than the picture you view online otherwise its exactly what i wanted it for organizing just small tiny for price the drawer for the sticky notes did not come with the caddy the thin rectangular space in the back is kind of useless i thought it would go down to the bottom of the case so i could put a pad of paper in it but it's not i was super excited about this to put on my desk and it would be a great product but the one i received was slightly bent the top back slot for paper clips push pins etc was bent so i can't put paperclips in it because they will fall through the slight crack made from the bent metal it was packaged well so it wasn't due to shipping but due to a factory defect i'm guessing i was disappointed about this still a great product i'm sure i just wish it wouldve come in better condition product itself looks okay but it did not fit in my drawers difference did not come with the drawer as advertised quite disappointing this product showed up completely bent and dented and even broken good quality but the central little drawer flies out as there is nothing to stop it the metal is a heavy enough gauge that the weight of the drawer makes it a hazard i'm using it but can't really recommend it based on the nuisance of having to pick things up from the floor if i forget this or one of my kids goes to borrow something from the caddy and the drawer become a torpedo it was smaller than what i thought product was flawed corners were not even and an absolutely horrible welding job great for my work desk this should cost no more than including shipping especially with prime it's sturdy and does what it was designed to do hold your business cards this came without the small drawer now i have to go through the hassle of repacking the box tore heading to the ups store and returning the thing this is missing it's drawer comes with missing drawer however good quality the product is greatand just what i wanted but unfortunately my drawer was not deep enough to hold it i sent this product back right away because i was so disappointed with the quality of this product it was flimsy and very poorly constructed not the best quality the whole unit is lopsided due to uneven welding doesn't even lie flat on the bottom due to bent metal tried bending back to fix it problem is all the weld jobs on the top are uneven so that doesn't really work either save your money much smaller than anticipated my fault for not checking dimensions more carefully not happy with the roll out compartment feature on the bottom would not recommend it to others what i needed don't waste your money tiny 'organizer' maybe for a child's desk but then not large enough to hold a file of papers utensil 'cups' terribly small as well they need show a photo of a quarter next to this these items so one can gauge how small they truly are this would sell fro at walmart or less it is really a disappointment and leaves you feeling as you were scammed since it has the paper holder you'd think this is pretty big right when i opened the shipping box i could not believe how small it is it is x square amazons fake reviews are out of control and should not be allowed if this has any positives they have to be fake good design but not in good quality ok for having one in office when i received this item it was missing the tray that pulls out it is too much of a hassle to return it so i'm keeping it anyways without the tray that should have been in it gets the job done best in limited space loved it but they didn't send it with the drawer i don't want to send it back because i need it i wish they would send the drawer only instead of having to return it in whole i should have read the size wish it was bigger this organizer has the right idea but for me is too small i wish it had more letter holders i also wish there was a larger size designed for folders i would find it much more useful it works but is very small i should have paid closer attention to the size advertised great organizer and sorter for all the various writing tools i use daily at work my only complaint is the front face on pull out basket is not even one side is higher lower than the other and because i have an eye for detail i constantly notice the defect which is both disappointing and a distraction if it were not for the flawed measurment i'd give it five stars doesn't appear to be a real rolodex product and not impressed with the workmanship of this product at all products we own that are rolodex are made much better i didnt get the center piece horrible buy i couldn't use it since it wasn't level i wish mine came with the drawer like everyone elses seemed to it looks weird without it drawer is missing smaller than it looks not the greatest quality but it does the job i purchased this product and had to send it back twice now due to improper notice of detail the first time the mesh drawer was indented and the second time the wiring was sticking out the size dimensions are as expected but the quality of the construction is somewhat lacking as the post it tray is crooked as is the rolodex logo not as shown it says it is rolodex brand except it came from china the box was written in chinese and it didn't have any brand markings very disappointed as it is smaller than the one i had expected upon arrival i was satisfied but unfortunately shortly after purchasing this item i found another product that was similar had more storage and for less money what a piece of junk sorry i bought it nice look and easy to use i was excited for the package after reading plenty of positive reviews about this desk organizer mine came with some dents on the bottom compartment and in fact the bottom compartment got cracked the seal must be very minimal i did not return it since i just did not want all the hassle related to it i just pushed the bottom compartment in pretending there is no crack there the organizer was smaller than i hoped for as well i wonder why there is no bigger desk organizer for this in fact many people may benefit from a bigger organizer than this i purchased this item because of good design however when i received it today i found out that the drawer was missing it will waste my time to get refund or replacement if you would like to purchase it you need to check other reviews to confirm that it does not happen frequently it will do but so small i only looked at the comparison with other similar products at the middle of the page which has the wrong dimensions for this item x the correct dimensions are at the top of the page please correct this information so no one else like me makes the mistake of buying this item i ordered two of these i would be giving this five stars if one of them was not missing the mesh drawer it's pretty annoying to receive something missing one of the parts and for something that only cost it clearly isn't worth my time to figure out how to return it and get one with the drawer i just spent about five minutes trying to figure out how to give feedback direct to who i ordered it from and was unable to it looks great in picture and i am sure if the maker can put more effort on the product it could be very elegant in the office desk but the one i received has a crooked logo on it i mean come on it's your product you can't put your logo straight um the dividers within the organizer aren't in any way connected to the bottom so anything thin line a ruler or paperclips or anything of that nature shuffles around from section to section the point of my buying this is to keep things separate not to have to dig things out constantly it's an ok product otherwise so i got my cardholder and realized its folded wrong and doesn't sit flat it holds cards and i use it as a phone stand but yeah still folded wrong expensive and top trays are shallow and useless as is draw in center i bought it because it matches my other desk stuff this item is exactly as pictured unfortunately the rolodex logo is hot glued onto the mesh it was not attached fully and there was hot glue residue all over the item surrounding the logo i purchased a non branded version of this item that i am extremely happy with it appears that for this item at least the rolodex name does not mean good quality control item showed up with the rolodex logo hot glued on there was hot glue residue all over the area where the logo was attached since i purchased this item for use in the workplace i promptly returned it if you do not care about it looking perfect this would be an awesome item it is slightly different than other organizers available on amazon and i do like the design better unfortunately as i said the logo was messed up this wasn't something that happened in shipping it was poor qc from whoever manufactures it its okay nice organizer for your desk smaller than it looks mine didnt come with the drawer piece just an empty space but it is honestly okay i put my tape in there i just wish it had the little drawer i looked around in the box and everything i do like all the spaces it has to put my highlighters my pens pencils i am just disappointed the drawer is missing the pictures show that it is missing all around a good product though has fallen off my desk a few times already and doesnt dent or anything its nice but the compartment that pulls out actually is not attached to anything so it falls out very easily everything else is good on this product great product but the little drawer in the middle is so loose it literally falls out when you try to pull it open i've just resigned to removing it and putting stuff like post its and a stapler in there bent funny very poorly made even though it carries the rolodex name the rear edge is where the two ends of the metal band meets and it is not straight it is markedly crooked so set on the table the thing is not stable it rocks from side to side meanwhile a no name brand i saw at work which inspired me to buy this as a tablet stand has a perfectly straight back edge metal bends very easy drawer arrived bent and it was poorly packaged i thought the back compartment went the length of the caddy like the pen holders on the sides but it doesn't all in all i'm happy with it it's a decent size and there's plenty of room for everything that i need at my desk ordered of these due to the positive reviews and low price all of them had a manufacturing defect where they are all bent at an angle in the horizontal sense as one views them from the front the fold at the top was not bent correctly causing the rest of the frame to be misaligned this holds the cards at an angle relative to frame and is extremely ugly the frame also doesn't sit flat on the desk surface it wobbles due to the weird angle on which it was bent even the rolodex sign was glued on at a crooked angle relative to the mesh frame these are of the lowest quality i have seen avoid these if you care about the presentation of your business cards rolodex has some serious quality control issues to address with this product i had high expectations for this product when i ordered it when it came in the mail today i noticed the note pad tray was missing not very happy about this product i ordered a whole desk set of stuff like this every other piece is fine but the card holder is warped a bit so cards sit kind of diagonally it's a minor point but annoying to see every day wish these were a little more flashy and or a little more durable not entirely a fan was bent up but kept it didn't want to go through trouble of returning it i am annoyed that the drawer was missing on the unit i received this item just didn't cost enough to warrant going through the hassle of a return so i kept it as is i like it it came a little dented nothing serious it rattles a little more than i'd like but i guess that's just what comes with anything with a mini drawer i like the size of all the wells and sections i'm glad it doesn't take up too much desk space item arrived missing the center drawer i didn't mess with sending it back because the way i am going to use it is okay to just have the opening in the center just way to small the pen and pencil area is not as large as could be the front slopes up instead of being open for pens pencils should have been plenty of space i am a little disappointed not as versatile as we were expecting middle cups and small drawers not too usefull we are planning to replace it nice but the front left compartment of mine appears to be slightly bent not really worth the fuss of returning but packaging handling needs improvement this is a nice organizer but it is very small didn't fit my desk so i was charged to return a item and that was even with me dropping off at ups hate feeling ripped off make sure it fits this size was too big this item is nice but its very small smaller than a normal desk caddy received it fast net is bend on the back and also have a big cracked that i can see through came with drawer missing i don't feel like messing with a return so i just got slightly hosed oh well gooddd i am not crazy about the mash since things like pins can fall through and if you open the drawer put your hands in it can scratch it pretty bad other than that it is ok the compartments are useful for organizing my desk at work nice mine arrived without the little tray part of it i'm not really sure how you could forget that part but it's not there i guess it works alright otherwise but i'd definitely prefer to have the tray i was disappointed in this one i thought i coulf put my note paper in the top section i can't it's way too small the compartments for pencils etc are small too and if i pick it up to move it the draw falls out the mesh wass dented where the rolodex was imprinted and glued on not high quality returned it the rolodex insignia was poorly glued on at a non level angle and bent the mesh i returned this this is way too small for an adult desk i gave it to my year old grandson he wishes it was larger it definitely is handy and organizes your desk supplies however the drawer that pulls out is wobbly and uneven i'm not sure if i just got dealt a faulty one or not but it's super annoying and looks cheap if it wasn't for the rattling of the drawer this product would have gotten a star rating from me i wont buy it again this is a handy little organizer is sturdy and well made however it's quite a bit smaller than i had expected my fault for not paying closer attention to the dimensions but what is really disappointing for me is that mine arrived without the little drawer insert that is supposed to come with it bummer i don't know why so many people give it star reviews it is small and not even flat when it sit on the desk one of the top clip on frames did not fit it seems like it was defective and i had to leave it off the rest of the product was fine the draw falls out if you move the supply caddy at all also there are only parts of it that are deep enough for pens etc the others are short and not very useful as described too smal clearly not made in a quality process the front looks fine but on the back there is a rolodex logo glued on and it is not well done the logo is crooked and there is glue visible on and around the logo completely takes away the professional look i am not sure how this is a desk organizer it is about inches wide and will fit some of my mail and some pens i wish i had a job that could be organized by something so small good for home use maybe but don't expect to be able to put a file folder or anything larger than an envelope in it overall this is a space saving desk organized but it is not the best quality of materials pros the desk caddy makes very good use of space and is able to organize most everyday desk items cons the drawer is very poor quality the drawer is difficult to pull out and to push in it has a tendency to stick as if it is a little too big for the caddy i absolutely love it doesn't seem like its a true rolodex product back was pushed in and a rolodex logo glued on presentation was poor but for the price it did its job it didnt fit what i wanted it for but works well for other things kind of mixed on this this is a business card holder it tips and does not do what it is suppose to do hold cards without falling out all over the place very clumsy and not worth the price and the effort too soon to see results can't evaluate at this early stage sorry nice good really like it nice size but does not want to hold notes on front it looks like a nd grade arts and craft project the welds are bad and uneven it is not worth the i spent on it i guess the workers at rolodex have no pride in their work either that or they're blind the workmanship is bad and they should be ashamed of themselves it's ok arrived damaged it's a nice product but i'm not that happy with it in my drawer it ok light use nice works as an iphone stand but i don't use it as much as i thought i would pretty much worthless poor design the center drawer just pops out and drops off not too functional except for the pencil holder section the front drawer is missing otherwise it looks like it would suit my needs perfectly once this is remedied i would probably give it five stars does the job i needed it for this item is larger than i thought it was going to be it is too big to be placed in a drawer which is what i was looking for in the first description it states inches long by inches wide by inches high it's actually inches long great concept but the drawer is way too loose and falls out and everything in it ends up on the floor otherwise it's nice nothing special get out your ruler guys this thing is tiny compact size reasonable design acceptable quality nothing to like and nothing to hate the drawer slides out esiley wich i didnt like got the clutter off my coffee table next to my tablet seems to be okay but it is smaller than i expected don't think it was worth the price i paid for it this is a solid well made drawer organizer it is much nicer than the plasticky ones that are much cheaper the only problem for me was the organizer is very snug in my drawer in fact i had to wedge it in tightly my office desk is huge and the drawers are what i thought would be standard size so my advice would be to measure your drawers with a tape measure before buying this organizer it's a little wider than standard i thought it was very small looks much more bigger in pictures wasn't too excited about this purchase at all i am worried that it won't last i ordered and one arrived broken they sent me a replacement but i am worried they will not last i really wish i had bought a card holder with sides to keep cards from sliding out for the price though i can't complain if you think you'll encounter the same issue i would recommend buying a business card holder with sides only problem i have is the little drawer it's basically just a box inside a box nothing holding it in there when i was trying to figure out where to place this i kept swinging the drawer out all over the place to fix it i tied a little string to the back of the drawer to the back of the thing so it won't fall out if i have to move it again overall decent yea it holds a phone good but it also blocks of the screen i know that's not what this is intended for but i bought it after reading reviews for a cheap phone holder i am sure it holds business cards just fine however how exciting can a desk organizer be really but it does serve it's purpose so all in all i'm happy with it it's ok you get what you see made of metal solid quality nothing fancy about it it was little bit smaller than i thought it was going to be i bought this for an ipod holder and it works somewhat maybe with little additions it will work but i haven't settled on a design yet it probably works well for its intended purpose does what it is supposed to but not too impressive to look at if you look at the photo you will see that the holder is bent unevenly not sure the reason for this it is light and cheaply built but does the job for a couple bucks i like the mesh organizers because they are strong and blend in well with my space however sometimes it appears whomever designed a particular organizer just didn't pay much attention to how someone might use it for example in this unit there are two back bins which are of an inch too small to hold the regular size x post it notes a quarter of an inch really didn't anyone try to put some post its in the bin when they made the prototype prototype ah no likely this was designed on a computer and the bin was specified to be inches wide but the material width wasn't taken into consideration so the bin turned out too small i'll use the unit but it's disappointing to be so close yet so limited wake up designers think through the use for your products and then make sure the stuff to be organized actually fits ps i expect to get a comment that m should make the x post it notes smaller and that would solve the problem i bought it because it is the right size to fit post it my desk is a lot more organized now i think it could have been designed to be more functional it basically holds vertical pens pencils scissors etc items and horizontal letters papers etc items no place for paper clips or other small items there is nothing wrong with this item but it's just okay it would be nice if it held more cards i'm not particularly excited about this desk organizer the drawer doesn't fit well is crooked had to put felt on the bottom edges so it would slide more easily and wanted to straighten it out the unit serves it's purpose but i don't think it deserves a glowing review the metal piece in the front is crooked overall it's not that bad i would not recommend if i were you pic looks pretty big but nooo its the size of my hand and i have small hands this is my first time giving review on amazon i have to because its such a disappointment it is smaller then i thought it would be but i guess it will work the picture made it looked big then it is after looking at similar products on amazon i bought this specifically for reasons one it was not as high as other pencil holders i often use store shorter items due to small hands and those items would have been more difficult to remove using other products that were taller over time i knew that would irritate me two i liked the number of dividers sectioned dividers lastly really was the price i will not order another one however for a couple of reasons although this sits on my desk i move it around a lot and the darn drawer slides out incredibly easily and hits the floor if you are never going to move this it might not bother you i needed a desk organizer that i could place in my desk drawer this seemed to be what i was seeking however when i got the thing was huge there was no way it could fit in my desk drawer let alone any desk drawer it was wide and extremely deep i couldn't imagine anyone would want it on their desk as it would take up so much space i returned it asap this is a half way decent mesh business card holder the one i received is slightly uneven and wobbles slightly if you push on it otherwise it's fine i can't give it more than stars because of that though item on website looks bigger than it really is so make sure you read the measurements before placing the order does the job simple as that it also looks nice on my desk the fact that the sides are open kinda is bad because my cards can fall down if i pick up the whole thing this same product can be bought at walmart for just over it does not have the rolodex logo on it but that is the only difference in my opinion this is a total ripoff i uploaded a photo of the one i received today it's a black mesh card holder however it's a slightly different style much more square and plain than the one amazon has pictured i wish i would have gotten the same style not worth my time to return or anything it's ok but bummed enough to deduct a couple stars i see that other reviewers got the one as pictured so your mileage may vary depending on who the seller is mine came from best source office supplies for five bucks even free shipping nothing mind blowing here it's a metal mesh stand for your business cards or in my case i place an old iphone on it and use it on my night stand as an alarm clock looks like it looks in the pictures does what it is supposed to do pleasantly surprised that it is not actually as super light as i feared it might be i'm a teacher so people walk by my desk and fiddle and fuss with things daily and it hasn't dumped over it's not as cute as the origami one a student made me last year but it's more stable i have one of these from that gargantuan chain store the only chain store left for under and at that i find it very much overpriced handy but should be relegated to dollar store merchandise capitalism at its finest i was warned but had seen this item in a friend office read othe reviews it's probably just bad inspection mine arrived very crooked the main basket is slanted which makes it look cheap rather than seek and organized it's a bit disappointing this is a medium guage metal pen pencil desk organizer with a bin that can be removed though it does take some fidgeting to get it out i think the middle section of this unit could have been designed better the bin takes up too much space and does not slide out well at all this leaves less room for pens and pencils and the top sections are an odd size if you need the big drawer then all is well but i cannot think of anything but post it notes to go in there and who needs that many the pen pencil sections are too wide and too shallow so that pens and pencils just kind of flop around and this looks messy on a desk i brought this to replace the age old mug solution and this has the same overall appearance of something put to uses other than what it was intended to do the separate sections of this are welded together and they are not very even joins so it rocks a bit and looks kind of sloppy up close on the front right of the unit there is a rolodex logo and the one i have is very crooked the logo is stamped into the metal screening so it cannot be fixed and it just makes the whole thing look a bit shabby for the money i expected something a little more refined than this unit false advertisement was not in working condition was able to print one label before it got caught in an false label jam error managed to clear the error once but after the next label printed the error returned tried it with a new tape and same error occurred immediately other folks seem happy with theirs but mine is completely unusable you should probably save yourself the time of having to return this and get the more expensive one can't get it to work all looks like it should but keep getting a message saying it's jammed no information on how to resolve in the instructions the extra tape is blue also the tape doesn't stick well to anything i've applied it to so far not worth purchasing the bonus pack batteries not included otherwise the labeler is nice this review is for the plug n play version easy to set up but it printed labels with white streaking through all the black letters see photo made several attempts including with a different labels cartridge thinking it might need a few break in prints but it failed repeatedly dymo didn't respond within the hours they requested to answer my troubleshooting submission to their customer service so after hours i returned it item arrived broken packaging was already open and the packaging for the label tape was ripped very disappointed first time this happens no stars i like the size and it offers a lot of functionality for the price but i've had issues with the label maker consistently printing with good quality periodically the printing is very faint which means i burn through more label material than i should its ok dont get me wrong it does what its supposed to do not very expensive and its not that old school label maker with the wheel you have to turn my big issue is when its time to use symbols there is no easy way to just go to the symbol you want to use you have to toggle through all of them would have been nice if you can program the order of the most used symbols for instance i use dash alot i would be nice to have that saved as a st option with symbols instead of needing to hit the right arrow times you also cant just clear the text and start a new label you have to backspace and clear it all out i would have really liked to get the wireless label maker and do it on the computer but at its not that serious for my needs easy to use and does the job but has two issues the power button does not always work the first time you push it i could not see a way to adjust the marginal space at the start and end of printing i don't want white tails off my labels so i just cut them off this means i am wasting a lot of label tape that i don't need to and other models i have used at work allow you to reduce the margin space i think this machine was designed to have too much margin in order to run out of label tape faster and have to buy more sooner overall i bought this on amazon for under what great price compared to what i saw others pay so for that reason alone i am ok having to cut some tails off this stopped working on my computer after a few times it was too late to return it overall i'm very happy with it the quality of the labels is good it doesn't waste a ton of material though it could be less and the app interface is good the reason i'm deducting stars is that i had to repair the battery which seems like a common issue with this product based on the other reviews that i've read i used it for about a year then packed it away for another year when i took it out of storage i got a low battery error when trying print even after letting the battery charge for hours i removed the battery pack from the printer and split the case halves apart with a utility knife there are two aa liion cells inside with a hobby battery charger i attempted to discharge and charge the battery cells they were completely dead i purchased replacement cells here on amazon http a co vksnfr and soldered everything back together the printer's working great again but unless you're good at soldering and enjoy tinkering be aware that you'll probably have to buy a new battery pack or repair the pack at some point this product only has two stars on dymo's website and almost all of the negative reviews have to do with the battery had this for less than a month and it broke i used it once this worked great out of the box but it eats batteries and now five months after we purchased it it won't work at all used it yesterday just fine and today nothing even after replacing the batteries i know that it's not an expensive item but you'd expect a little more longevity than this especially since it's not used every day very disappointed in a product amazon recommends jammed right out of package it worked for less than half of the cartridge that came with it now even with a brand new cartridge it just gives a label jam error with no jam in sight broken in less than months didn't even get through set of batteries before a permanent label jam disabled it sought out fixes on youtube and tried all of the troubleshooting no go star manufacturer seal was broken on all units that i bought they doesn't seem like brand new at all i bought this a few months ago but didn t end up needing it until today so i opened the package and put the tape and batteries in it won t print it continuously says paper jam but there s literally no jam since it s never been used i ve trued taking it apart putting in new tape ab new batteries and nothing complete waste of money and since i bought it a while ago there no way to return it when i got mine it didn't look like the picture on the picture there's a brightly lit screen and all the buttons are lit up when i got mine the 'ok button and its arrows are visible but all the buttons around them were barely visible the screen was not backlit none of the buttons were lit i called customer service and asked them if there was a turn light on button that i was missing they said they didn't know of one and suggested that i return the unit so i did that and got another unit but it has the same problem i'm going to return them both and search for something else did not work when i got it i received this product and installed batteries every time i hit print it tells me i have a label jam i've watched several consumer made youtube videos showing how to fix this issue and nothing worked it shouldn't be this hard to clear a label jam the item was used supposed to be new and broken could tell it was used seal on package was already cut it was missing the tape that is included with a new package food crumbs along with the oily residue from food was on the cardboard packaging needing this i tried anyway and it does not work error message says it is jammed after troubleshooting nothing works overall have had good consistent experience and buy a lot from amazon for this specific transaction not so much it is absurd that replacing the rechargeable battery costs more than the original product i will not buy a dymo product anymore unintelligent by this company es absurdo que reemplazar la bater a recargable cueste m s que el producto original no comprar un producto dymo nunca m s poco inteligente por parte de esta compa a we purchased the pnp model after a year or two of use the battery no longer holds a charge which means it no longer prints doesn't matter if left to charge battery remains dead the manufacturer lists replacement batteries on their website but they are perpetually out of stock it jams often but it's easy to use and does the job most the time didn't work i am so very disappointed in this product the gear at the back of the labelmaker is jammed therefore a constant paper jam notice comes on the screen any time i wish to print a label i have tried twisting the gears repositioning the label etc but nothing has worked mind you this is a brand new label machine it's pretty frustrating please please please do not waste your money on this product i ordered extra ink and they are still printing faded i bought new duracell batteries and it says low battery after prints good but runs out of tape quickly i had to pay tax you already have to charge taxes mine never worked got it as a christmas gift so by the time i opened it on christmas day it was too late to return it always says paper jam when we try to print a label we thought it could possibly be the spoil of label tape so we ordered new spools i just recieved them today and it still says paper jam really disappointed i guess i ll order a new printer and hope for the best bought this label maker and it came to me defective it never worked and said paper jam i returned it to amazon for a second one and the second one did the same thing bummer bought before that worked perfectly so i bought more the never printed keep getting low battery and prints blank going to try buying an a c adapter poor product labels are in poor printing quality and the label maker itself is so cheap and poorly made i would not recommend prints beautifully and easy to use labels would not stick i must be using the wrong tape don t buy this first you need to separately purchase the dc charger cable second it claims to run on alkaline batteries it doesn t i m not sure what kind of batteries work on it i gave up and sent it back i also purchased a roll of label tape for it that cannot be returned even though i didn t use it one of my worse amazon experiences just received this item popped some batteries in and it won t work what am i doing wrong yes the ink is in yes the labels are in and yes i put the batteries in the right way wasn't expecting much from this product when i ordered it still managed to blow my low expectations out of the water was mailed defective product tried to two fixes dymo recommended didn't work shipping internationally is expensive i ordered an extra cartridge just incase with my label maker i m very glad i did because the one it came with didn t work the quality of this label maker is only fair it does the job but not well the labels don t print off clearly each time it s always a hit or miss it only lasted years without very much label making did not use the whole roll of the first tape before it died and would not feed tape replaced two different sets of batteries and it still won't work was never happy with using special characters it took about clicks to get to the dash we bought of these at home and for the office the one at home keeps eating the tape we only use one type of tape white on clear aside from the default one that came with it we ve wasted too much tape on the other unit which my wife always uses on her essential oils we ve put different tapes already but it keeps eating it i don't usually like posting bad reviews but unfortunately this label maker deserves one i ordered one to use around the house and it was dead on arrival it looked like it had possibly been opened and returned already so i requested a new one from amazon and sent this one back unfortunately the second one i received was also dead on arrival i bought a replacement cartridge thinking that the one that came with the label maker was bad the label maker unfortunately still didn't work even with the new cartridge i took this as a sign and requested a refunded for the label maker and sent it back instead of requesting another one i ended up buying a brother label maker and it has been great the printing quality is not enough it can't believe this is dpi it shows a text which has stair shape very visually in the rounded corner also the stair shapes especially expose these limit in the every rounded shape included any symbol it is not clear when i use the new battery it told me the signal the battery is low received unit went and bought aaa batteries fired it up and only to find out amazon sent me a broken unit every time i would try to print no tape would come out and it made an ugly noise as if components were grinding i triple checked everything referred to the owners manual but this was not a use error upon taking a closer look at the packaging and the unit itself it had scratch marks all over the front and back this leaves me to think that the new one i paid for was actually an open box return by someone who probably had the same issue with it and didn't bother to tell amazon or dymo the truth amazon cant return the extra tape i bought to which is classic used very little labels for home files and toiletries when traveling about the fifth use it started giving a label jammed error message although the label paper was not jammed went online and learned that this is an electronic error and tried the suggested fix which did not work contacted the company which sent me essentially the same suggested fix which did not work again when i emailed back that my machine was still not working did not hear from dymo again so customer service is nil and product is unreliable it keeps yelling at me that the paper is jammed even though i have followed all instructions included within the product box and dug up the full user manual online read that and it still doesn't work i was sold a broken label maker it does not work and keeps giving me label name error messages when there is no jam i got a defective unit unit stated label jam when trying to print i tried three different cassettes pulling the label tape up and a second set of batteries bummer does not work troubleshooting with the approved dymo guide is useless and nothing i can find has helped nothing fixes the printer jam error and at bucks it was cheap enough that i don't think i'll go through the hassle of giving it back it is a frustrating inconvenience that made sure i wont buy another one label jam upon unboxing item does not work or print labels i have looked up troubleshooting videos and followed all the tips but the item still does not work no operating instructions came with it for some reason mine won t print and i bought a roll of printer tape because the description was unclear whether it came with it or not it did so i ve tried them both batteries in type my name and nothing i m gonna try and return it i guess the label maker in itself is fine except that it goes through pairs of aaa batteries in less than a day even with the item turned off and not in use i purchased an ac adapter specifically for it and it did not work either i am purchasing a superior item next time here i feel like just wasted my money i bought this label maker to replace a brother p touch that just wastes label tape by feeding extra tape between each label that makes me mad every time i use it i have only used this device for a couple of labels so far and it seems to work okay however i'm seriously considering returning this label maker because it accepts only a proprietary battery pack that at costs more than a new lm that includes a battery and it doesn't work without a battery even if plugged into the charger i really wish that i had learned this before ordering it does not work on mac though the description says it does not as good a a brother p touch doesn't allow upper and lower case and features like cramped keyboard haven t turned it on yet don t have six aaa batteries lying around maybe suggest that item as a bundle wont stay on did not open package for the first months and when i finally had use for it nothing printed as expected letters are barely if at all visible trashed it and am dissapointed with dymo i have'nt use it i could not figure how it worked it jamed up for me so its back in the box it came in this label never worked i kept receiving the prompt that there was a jam it never worked once to begin with and i had multiple fellow teachers try to help out with it different tape cartages did not work worthless it works but does have it's hiccups once in a while when printing the dpi is not the best of quality but works for my needs pos i've had this for almost months and haven't used it a whole lot yet i tried using it today and the screen started to flash and it shut off and now it won't go back on i would not buy this unit i contacted the company and i have to file a claim to get a new one currently searching for another one by a different brand because it keeps saying the never used printer has a label jam and none of the troubleshooting is working not found when using mac os high sierra no drivers available from dymo past make sure you're running old mac os if you are interested in this printer very disappointed this label printer is not ready for prime time i am using a mac running high sierra the first step in setting this up is to hook the printer up via usb open the app that is stored in the printer and configure it for wireless i was able to open the app but never could get it to print a label connected locally i was able to configure the wireless setting and get the device on my network but then after downloading the desktop application i could never print to the printer via wireless i would get the error message printer not responding i contacted dymo support via live chat and had a broken english conversation with a tech how was useless at trouble shooting she was asking questions like is the power turned on duh anyway i was able to print one label with the printer hooked up locally after downloading the latest rev of their desktop app but never via wireless and i spent way to much time trying i have had good luck with brother printers in the past and i see they make a wireless label printer so i will give it a try the reason i didn't buy the brother in the first place was that it was twice the cost of the dymo but i got zero value for my money with the dymo anyway don't buy i've done everything to fix this label jam but nothing is working yes i have it in the right way no i am not using the wrong label everything is right if you know how to fix this feel free to let me know this little device has been so frustrating and time consuming i have downloaded software online i have called our it department i have called customer service and was told they were in a meeting called back and currently sitting waiting for min and counting i've even watched youtube videos to see if it was something i was missing and changed cables in case of a bad wire nothing has worked i think their customer service plays relaxing spa music so you wont go bananas on them this has been the worst product i have purchased online if i had my timeframe to return i would have done it along time ago it is my fault that i waited too long to return just so all reviewers know i have a macbook air i have the latest software and guess what the concept of plug and play is a darn joke this has been more like plug and throw away update i have contacted dymo customer service again and have found out the battery was not in the battery compartment which means it will not work i assumed with the light turning on it was getting power unfortunately this was a packaging error and incomplete project causing me so much wasted time the man helping me did figure out the problem and although at times condescending in tone was overall helpful which was obviously the goal he also is sending me a battery at no charge as it is in warranty this was nice of him stay tuned for change in star rating or not did not include the battery recharger adapter so had to buy one and they ent me the wrong one besides not at all cooperative i ordered this in july of and have used it a dozen times and it when i went to use it last week it won't print anymore i've changed the batteries put in new labels and it still shuts off i liked that it prints clear i used it to label keys on an electric piano i used black tape and placed the labels above the keys on the keyboard it was hard getting the spacing because the display on the label maker does not show you the actual size of the characters when printing two lines of text if you line up the top and bottom rows on the display then they do not print out lined up on the label when printing two line labels the font would change to a smaller font the largest font size that i could use for a two line label was point lines of point only uses about of the width of the label i have been looking for some black label tape but cannot find it anywhere it has a proprietary battery which according to another review costs as much as the label maker it does not work on the charger without a battery it did not come with a driver for linux did get the job done eventually but i wasted a lot of label in the process looked good out of package i tried using it about weeks after i got it and would not print on label just kept feeding blank labels with any changes to print took it out of the box inserted batteries and the cassette that came with it and have gotten nothing but a label jam error never been used and it is useless tried second cassette i purchased same error and still no labels i threw the packaging away i d return it if i could have had for a few years used sparingly and the unit failed went with another brand for the replacement would not recommend good luck if you want to use this with a mac running high sierra i bought this thing because of all the positive reviews i don't know what all those positive reviews are for unless none of the users have ever used a brother label maker before lines of text on tape was blotchy faint and hard to read customer service was horrible supposed to open online chat at am est didn't open till after am but no one was actually taking texts save yourself some heartache and get a cheaper pt d by brother by the time customer service was answering chat i had processed the return made it to office depot and back to the office they said the tape may have been old the product was brand new in the box from amazon i have tz tape that is over years old and it still prints just fine what is brother doing to their tapes to make them last so long that dymo is not doing also the dymo p does not allow for text going across from left to right in portrait view only down the label i guess dymo also does not care about customer service or any sort of feedback as they just ended the chat when i tried to give them some usable feedback about their product oh and the p won't work without a battery in place good luck to dymo owners i bought one of these and it worked for about a day before breaking i ended up buying this product which is essentially a printer you plug into a usb port on your computer it is way faster and dependable https www amazon com gp product b e p ref oh aui search detailpage ie utf psc it didn't work called manufacturer and had to mail it to them they promptly replaced product with the same model the second one works great for the price i use it at work it's reliable and works well for my use this machine was no good i used it for my office to make patient labels and in the middle of a thousands of patients it stopped working and we did everything to fix it did not work very bad system junk right out of the box tried to print my first label and all i get is label jam that's no help in the box or on the device so i go to the dymo website useless no help or information on what do do to clear the jam really guys this has never come up in the history of this device you can't even put something in the faq about what to do next fine first dymo and last trying to return for refund we'll see how this goes i like the over all product and functionality but it takes more than one cut with the scissors button to get the lable tape out and after that the following lable usually gets jammed inside or prints crooked i've reinserted the lable tape cartridge several times but it seems to be a persistent problem which means i'm running through a roll of lable tape rather quickly good price easy to use but broke through normal use after one cartridge of use i was anxious to start using my new label maker unfortunately every time i try to print i get an error message label jam i just bought this tried another new cartridge and got the same error message very unsatisfied recieved item today it is listed as new but the box had already been opened as evident from the sticker on the flap was cut on top of that the starter cartridge was missing disappointed but will see how this product performs and update later this was great until it broke after less than months we didn't have that high of volume had the same error some other people have described here label tape is jammed or something even though it is not tried to fix it a bunch of different ways to no avail returned product amazon return was quick and easy nice product but mine was missing the tape won t buy a used one again this product never worked from day one the feed stopped working and could not print properly wish they would replace with a better option the seal was broken from the package and it did not have the tape luckily i bought tape separately very disappointed i purchased this unit months ago and have only used it a few times and the battery will not charge a replacement battery costs as much as this label maker i turned the unit off when not in use and did not leave it connected to the usb port continually this was actually a replacement unit i purchased to replace the same model when the battery that failed but that one had lasted for years when it does work it prints nice labels i wouldn't buy it again tape does not come out all the way it keeps getting stuck and i have to open the machine and cut it myself defeats the purpose of a label maker it can print on the plastic label but that's about it i would like to preface this review by saying i love amazon you cant beat their prices and their customer service my usual means of buying stuff here is to read the reviews and see what people say i also consider the number of star reviews the more of them often indicating a product excels in quality and performance with that in mind i bought this dymo label maker i used it once and it worked fine i removed the batteries because i didnt know when it would be used again to my surprise it was needed a few days later so in goes the batteries and i tried to print it sputtered and gave an error message tape jam i opened the back and removed tape to examine it and the feed area all looked good so i fed a little of tape out and replaced properly and tried agin i got the same thing i then opened a new tape and repeated the whole procedure to no avail then i began to watch youtube videos to see what could be wrong i found one where a guy described my same issues and gave a fix of turning the drive shaft clock wise five times with your hand and activating the on switch i tired that replaced the tape fed it through with extra tape on the end and still the same error message at that point i sent it back and bought a brother maybe i got a dud maybe i got the one out of many that was doomed to fail but i gave up on it thanks to amazon for taking it back and even having u p s pick it up title says it all ive tried rolls of labels and neither of them stick to anything i wanted to use them to organize my workshop and the kids' playroom but they peel and fall off and create a choking hazard makes a nice label that's not very sticky doesn't come with a charger display doesn't light up making it very hard to read still not a bad buy for the price just wish i had bought a little better one i loved this label maker for the months it worked mind you this unit was taken very good care of as it had a permanent spot on my desk and only used tape of labels in that time very versatile offers complete customization to your labels through the included software would have been better if they made it connect and charge through a usb so that i don't have to connect to the printer port and also have an electrical outlet all clogged up querty keyboard makes for super fast label making however my unit never worked on just the rechargeable battery for on the go labels it always had to be plugged in kind of pointless if you ask me or maybe i got a defective unit i will be calling customer support to see what solutions they offer as i really am not thrilled to go with a different labeler as i ordered a pack of the label tape for my supply closet so i could do a large re filing project so overall great product but sadly this product mysteriously stopped working i purchased this as a gift for my husband for christmas after the holiday we have been traveling he went to use it and it does not work it turns on but does not print what do you advise i m told i can t return it now but it does not work poor quality immediately opened after receiving and tried to use it the u j and n keys do not work absolutely ridiculous i ve only used it a few times and for some reason it s not working it s making batteries corrode like it s cheap quality worked great then the batteries died i replaced them and still keeps saying low batteries so now i can t use my label maker i read another review about needing dymo batteries is that true if so this is a waste of money this is a good product held back by one simple thing i've lowered my star rating because to get the backing off of the printed tape to stick in on something is an absolute horror show very disappointing imho i bought this awhile back but didn't use it right away now after re charging the battery it doesn't print you can hear it moving but tape does not come out i opened the back pushed print i can see the gear moving but the tape does nothing after cursing i put a brand new cartridge in same results nothing pos bought this for my daughter's birthday unfortunately it didn't work at all right from the box because i actually purchased it months before her birthday the seller will not issue a refund or replacement this is junk this label maker is easy to use and prints a nice clear label the downside to this is that the tape will not stick to many surfaces long term i would consider a plastic tote a surface that a good label should adhere to without issue however in a month or so the label is coming off lesson learned secure with additional tape product description says single unit includes labelmanager label maker d starter label cassette black on white x ' quick start guide year limited warranty i did not receive d starter label cassette black on white x ' ordered one pnp label manger it did not work got a replacement and it did not work connected to a friend's hp pc it worked tried it on my mac again it did not work i contacted dymo they said they would get back to me in hours it has been and still no email or other contact i bet they know it does not work so let amazon bear the burden osx el capitan downloading two versions of software from dymo did not work either gave to daughter and ordered turbo first time using and the ink doesn t print well can t tell what the words are suppose to be also have to press the on button or times before it will actually turn on kept getting label jam tech support couldn't fix it i was told to return the item as it is defective although i ordered it in october i was away from home as a caregiver to family member for over weeks and unable to get batteries from amazon and try it until last night is there any way that this item can be returned printing feed gets stuck too often to be useful gets black lines after a while on labels stopped working after days and i'm past my return window so now i have a useless pos no one knows how to fix keeps giving label jam error there's no jam don t know yet it was a gift the description is very misleading i have a late model imac os high sierra and the out of the box plug and play software does not work i am unable to populate the text box by typing or copy pasting which thus renders the plug and play feature useless i then spent a lot of time searching the mfg's website for drivers software to see if there were any workarounds plain and simple this product does not work and the mfg does not appear to be concerned with supporting mac users i will look to another option outside of dymo never worked after i opened the box print quality is great but the tape constantly gets stuck in the machine the label gun itself works great however the ink runs out rather quickly i recently bought it and i can not see the writing when i print the label great helpful easy to use did not like got replaced by dymo and love my new one the lm i haven t been able to use it beacuase u keep getting the label jam notice all the time i see in many blogs that this problem has happened to many people who bought this product in amazon what should i do wanted to like this but the software is clearly not compatible with the latest generation of mac os sierra numerous people have had problems the software is abysmal do not buy if you have an up to date mac this will be a frustrating waste of time i just received the product and it doesn't have either the adapter or the batteries i tried a working adapter tat i own but i couldn't turn it one stop working after using about times sucks the product did not work batteries dont stay in place and ink did not print worst of all once i returned the item for this reason i was not refunded the entire amount i paid and now am being paid don't buy i've used this label maker one time and now every time i try and use it it says i have a label jam i've wasted a ton of the label trying to make it think there is no jam but it still doesn't work there is no jam very frustrated update amazon replaced the unit and the new one has been working fine so far no jams no error messages i have ordered more tape since i have now gone through the minimal tape it's sent with i'll will follow up with another update if the new tape jams as of now i am very thankful for amazons willingness to replace the unit quickly good customer service the new unit does not work i tried on battery and dc power input all showed label jam i have to buy a same label manager at local shop bought it put batteries in put the cartridge it came with in and doesn t work paper jam on something never used tried trouble shooting and no success i thought this label maker was great at first it's easy to create labels and they look nice however months later all the labels have fallen off the label tape is too thick and not sticky enough i would return it all if i could defective when i got it the thing that spins the paper was jammed i feel bad returning products because i've been doing it so much lately that i might get in trouble with amazon so i just trashed it i don't feel like dealing with returns or replacements after all i've been doing used the product times and now when trying to print a label it says label jam even though there is not a jam the tape is always getting stuck instead the label maker i have owned several label makers and this is by far the worst had label maker for less than years will no longer hold a charge the replacement batteries cost as much as buying an entirely new label maker that includes a battery now that mine died i see many other reviews complaining of the same thing never buying another dymo machine is nice but printing tape gets caught and i had to print multiple times just to get one label also the adhesive on the labels is not very strong it didn t work kept saying label jam wouldn t print anything it worked once the tape ran out very quickly maybe a metre yard of labels certainly no more i purchased tape refill but before i have even changed the tape over i plugged the labelmanager into my desktop turned it on and nothing happened except a message from my computer asking me what i want to happen whenever i plug this device in i searched online for software for it but there isn't any i took it to my laptop and plugged it in there and nothing happened so much for plug and play more like plug and wait for nothing to ever happen so disappointed in this gadget half of the buttons stopped working after months and we only printed labels very disappointed the worst do not waste your money it did not work right out of the package brand new it continuously said that there was a jam i went through the entire roll of label tape to no avail i ordered another roll of label tape and just tried it today and the same thing this thing is absolute junk item seems to work great i am only concerned with long term reliability as i was shipped a used unit not new as described never worked stuck on label jam couldn't return it don't waste your money did not work jam error did not work gears would not turn the overall quality is consistent with the low price when inserting batteries aaa make sure they're all firmly in place when i first installed mine everything seemed fine until i pressed print at which point it stalled and gave a lower battery warning re seating the batteries resolved this additionally i've had the tape get stuck a couple times which is annoying and very wasteful the keyboard is pretty good typing is fine though hunting for any additional characters is an exercise in patience also would have been nice if there was an easy way to have different font sizes for each of the rows of text overall does what i need and nothing more purchased only because of the price got the product and it was defective wouldn't print a thing returned it pros great machine for labels technically i love this machine c o n s this machine can not hold a charge more than hours i have gone through many batteries because if you leave it plugged in it will eventually swell and you will be getting another battery you can take the battery our after use every time but who needs that the problem with this unit is that the engineering on this unit is very poor does not completely turn off when you hit the off button it still has a constant drain of power it will be dead in hours so unless you want to get a new battery every months or remove the battery after every use don't bother with this piece of crap i have since done some measuring of the battery problem with this unit with the unit off it still has a drain of ma which means that a mah will last about days in perfect world i have found it to be much shorter than that first thing i ve ever received that was broken before i touched it i drove to the store to get aaa batteries and come back load everything in and it s not working bad product the printer mechanism on the back is broken won t print or eject label tape rad don t waste your money also it s third party so amazon won t help get your money back weak this is not a working efficient label maker the ink rubs off and the print is spotty i haven't used it too much and had to purchase a new cartridge too soon i had higher expectations i'll be looking for another product it works just for days not what i thought needed to print inch file folder labels and this will not do it other wise no complaints i bought this product las january printed several labels all right not the best this january the device is not working it does not power not via batteries or adapter dead granted dollars is not a big amount but still i expected it to last more then labels later and months i'm deployed so i spent two weeks waiting for this to come no one's fault but as soon as i put my fresh pack of batteries in it i get err crc on the screen i couldn't find anything online about this error message i tried holding on off and backspace and that didn't work i tried taking one battery out and pressing on off times that didn't work does well on the white tape not so good on the clear serves its purpose but a little black print copy comes out with the label that i must peel off along with the backing for each label annoying worked great until recently about a year old and used a handful of times and now the screen is only half showing unable to see the font size half of what i am typing should last longer than a year highly disappointed do not buy this if you want your label maker to last more than a year works well with a power adapter works a short time or not at all with batteries i ended up with of these units and neither one will print more than one or two labels using new duracell aaa batteries prints nicely though when i use a ac power adapter the ribbon jammed repeatedly while printing wasting a good portion of the roll if i wasn't facing a time constraint to get a project done i would've returned it i decided to try the pnp as a replacement to my labelmanager that stopped working after less than years of having it a cartridge jam error that i couldn't resolve despite using different cartridges and having no obvious jam this pnp device was in no way pnp i followed the quick start instructions but when it was supposed to get underway it just did nothing after much trial and error and online research i found out that installing an older version of dymo software would allow it to recognize the printer at that point i was able to get it to print but only black text on my white label cartridge i tried printing on my black label cartridge and it wouldn't work even though i changed the text color to white i used to print fine with white on black on my older device so with the printer at least partially working on the software i upgraded to the latest software to see if that might help but then the printer wasn't recognized as the earlier article pointed out perhaps this is an easy fix but i'm tired of all the frustration and complications with this product given the amount of time spent on the and pnp devices i would've been better off just investing a bit more for a better product sending it back mine came defective kept saying paper jam out of the box opened it up and found the assembly was defective they pinched what looks like a power wire when assembling the product the roller in the device won't turn at all so it's not an issue with the cartridge cheap throw away label maker this unit worked fine when i used it however there is a rechargeable battery in the unit that being said most people would unpack it hook it up and use it then leave it until needed again wrong the instruction do state that the battery needs to be removed after use to extend it's life now this being a pnp plug and play label maker one would just leave it and go on the next time you go to use it maybe a year later it will not function because the battery is dead to replace it cost's more than the device i got about two uses out of it before i found the battery dead even if i had removed the battery and put it away for a year it probably would not have worked i for the life of me can not understand why they just did not design it to use either the v usb power or make it use a standard volt battery that could be replaced cheaply dymo chose to rape it's customers on battery replacements i have decided to never buy dymo products just because of this there are other manufacturers the battery never get completely charged it just two lines even if stay all night plug it bought it for labeling cables and other things does what i need but it didn't work out of the package after going online i learned that you might have to give it more than a few extremely hard bangs in case the gears get stuck been working since this is the worst thing i purchased in amazon bad quality and feel cheap not even worth an penny don t even work cuz regular brand battery not recommended it s only work with recommend battery brand another waste of money quite simply the product did not work out of the box it said there was a jam but there was no jam right before i was about to return it i twisted the gears and while stuck at first they broke free the product has been working fine since but i think it is unacceptable for a brand new product to be defective didn t work when we received it and can t return it because we bought it a couple of months before christmas when we opened it christmas morning it didn t work broken right out of the box label jam error labels never even attempted to print tried different cassettes what a waste of money and ruined christmas present cool out of the box on christmas morning label jam cannot clear with any of the troubleshooting methods major disappointment after i got the product in august i tested it right away the product self is good easy to be used pretty much match expectation and then month later i took it out and prepare to use it found the battery are drained out and i can't find any ac adapter within package not sure ac adapter is not included or i am unlucky enough got the one without ac adapter so two star for the product deduct three star for missing ac adapter used this to label all newly installed ethernet cabling initially everything looked and worked fine but it has now been a few months with the cables untouched and i started noticing that most labels started falling off even when sticking two glue sides together poor quality horrible for labeling cabling as they just fall off over time as shown in the picture find yourself a better product one which actually sticks properly and doesn't dry up to a useless piece of paper returning item right out of the box a label error message appears tried several times to print and nothing i removed cartridge and laced back and it still gave the same error the label maker did not work returned and disappointed i bought because i have almost dozen external hard drives and it's always a pain matching up the right ac power adapter to the right drive so i spent an entire day labeling the each drive and ac adapter problem solved but then days later i go to grab a drive and every single label is peeling and curled up at the ends the label maker itself works fine but the tape that it comes with is horrible if the labels actually stuck then i wouldn't given it stars the concept is great but for my purposes disappointing i was printing up new tabs for my file folder system unfortunately the printing on the tab could not be made as large as i wanted but in a size print that is difficult to read so i will be selling it at the next garage sale on a brighter side the customer service was excellent however i had to wait minutes on one occasion on another also if you have a newer mac with the thin and smaller usb port then make sure you have a converter otherwise it is not useable i would think this only useable for rudimentary and small labels where readability is not key of course then what is the point in having a label the labeler is not working i change the tape and prints only a fine string but not the text it has yet to work since i received it it jams all the time and doesn't print clearly it drains batteries like crazy if you leave it in without using it i am not too happy and i haven't gotten the time to return it as yet there is no dash will not work it's jammed i don't know if it's the cassette is labelmaker absolute trash this thing is the battery limits the use of the appliance as soon as the internal battery loses charge you re sunk for the rest of the day a new battery costs x the price of a brand new machine this machine is nothing more than a money grab don t waste your time battery does not take charge after tests and connect disconnect connect and on diff rents macintosh office and home still not working it s suppose to be plug n play for now i just did plug and plug and plug and plug n no play disappointed the the cutter tab is sticking did not come with the tape even though it said it would come with it garbage nothing but jams i would not recommend this label maker less than a month old and it continues to get jammed at the rubber wheel every one i have purchased does this not happy works when it wants to and wads up a lot wasted or time and money product does not work i was able to print about or so labels before connection the pc port disappeared i then recharged it overnight using a usb charger and then it worked on the pc again this time i was able to print label before the usb connection disappeared again there is definitely something wrong with either the battery or the unit itself uses too much battery power do not buy this is a total waste of my time and money will not work as well in windows with previous one on windows could get lines of printing with font size on windows can only get lines font wfl the first one i received was opened and missing things from the box the replacement was also opened and the screen protector had obvloisly been taken off and re applied the only reason it's stars is because it seems to be functional even if it's used i did not order a used item you get what you pay for this is a fantastic paper weight very disappointed did not even get to print one label the very first time we tried to print it iimmediately said label jam there of course was nothing to jam because nothing had been printed cheap price made the old adage true you get what you pay for this thing jams up all the time and there is a lot of waste after each use unable to make even a single label with my new label maker constantly reads label jam i tried all troubleshooting tips found online but nothing worked after searching online it seems to be a common problem with this label maker save your money the dynamo initially worked great but recently i've been unable to print labels evidently the upgrade on my imac is not compatible with the dynamo labeler i hope the dynamo can be made to work well again with the upgraded imac item did not work doesn't work at all and it now i cannot even return it i keep getting a label jam message i have tried everything looked online read through comments etc i am very very annoyed i don't know if it is a defect with the label maker or the tape cartridge that came with it but i don't have the time money or patience to figure it out would not buy it's and this does not charge over some form of usb instead it uses a barrel style charger that probably won't work with any of your other devices further i received a used product i never got to use this because it kept giving me a label feed error that i could not clear this happened on a weekend day and apparently everyone is off on the weekend so i was never able to contact a tech to help me so i sent it back i ordered a new label maker my label package was open as well as the cartridge casing unacceptable i will update on how it works later i like the products quality however it did not work for me when a i try to print anything it won t print it on the label so i believe i got a defective one will most likely go with another brand next time this is a nice looking label maker but it didn't work every time i tried to print a label i received a jam message i called the company and while the representative was very helpful once we finally got through a minute hold time after turning the black knob that holds the labels five to seven times and replacing the tape a total of times he said there was nothing else he could suggest and that we should return it it did not work brand new out of package and said label jam but there was no jam even tried a new tape roll same thing very cheaply made and flimsy unit was dead on arrival the motor would not turn and i would get an error message that the paper was jam i was force to send it back very frustrating i love dymo printers but this one is a total fail after using it for a year or so the battery died and now won't take more charge the printer is useless and replacement batteries run for as high as nice label printer works well can print letters not pictures arrived with years old battery which shortened battery life this is not acceptable for new product from amazon don't want to send it back because of the hassle and not clear how to request partial refund from amazon that's why i gave stars and not the tape doesn t like to stick as soon as i put the label tape inside and tried to print something it said there was a jam unable to use it despite having it looked by several professionals i had the tape jam error message that a lot of other people seem to be experiencing i ended up taking the cartridge out and manually turning the gear that feeds the tape a few times with my fingers and it eventually started working after attempts prints great since then if it weren't for the tape jam issue this would be a star product maybe i just got a dud but straight out of the box put new batteries and tape in and it reads tape jam literally never been used tried two different kinds of tape cassettes and still got the tape jam error message tried to return it but my return window has already passed so annoyed i would not recommend printed a handful of labels maybe before dying material comes through with no ink burned through the whole cartridge trying reinstalled cartridge still doesn't work happy i tried it right away so i can return this label maker did now work at all it kept saying that the tape cassette was not inserted called dymo i just kept being put on hold like others set it up with batteries and tape only to find it permanently reports label jam returned exactly the same problem with replacement looks like the whole batch is bad judging by recent reviews failed out of box new batteries new labels shows only label jam never worked return doesn't work i bought this a couple of months ago and it has never printed correctly i have changed the tape cartridge and still have not had something printer clearly correctly ended up purchasing a different model and getting rid of this one love dyno brand usually the machine itself was easy to use without needing to read directions not working in less than year with mild usage the light is blinking without any noticeable issue first one was doa replacement works fine its a nice compact unit it is advertised as being more efficient with tape than the brother unit i don't see any difference ineffective i bought this one year ago and used it during christmas to label packages i used it sporadically throughout here and there went to use it again to start labeling christmas packages and the battery area is totally corroded and the product no longer works i used duracell batteries which i've never had a problem with before super disappointed in this piece of junk needed to label all my network cables works as intended i wish it had more options good when it works but stopped working after a few months of use label prints overall very disappointed junk i bought two and neither one worked one returns a message tape jam there is no tape jam the other will not print the device looks great and feels good in your hands however the product was defective and kept displaying label jam despite adjusting and completely replacing the label cartridge i cannot get mine to print anything i thought it might have been a bad cartridge but after putting in another one it still will not print anything looked for hours trying to find a solution and can't waste of money has never worked when i try to print it says label jam there is no label jam overall this is a decent label printer and especially at the frequent deal price unfortunately the model that i got had what seemed at first to be a defective battery since it wouldn't charge to a this seems to be a common issue the customer service is very responsive and they quickly sent me a new battery but the new battery is doing the same thing maybe it's the charger the printer still works but it's just a bit disappointing probably best to go with the non rechargeable version and use your own rechargeable batteries defective right out of the box tried two different cartridges but never able to print a single label always received label jam message very disappointing pros easy to set up and use cons tape does not stick easy to peel off tape jam inside a lot times first time used no print display label jam this product sucks charging says hrs for the first charge had to charge it for hrs i would be fine with that but the list goes on as i use the label maker the label kept getting stuck in the machine losing time and tape i try at different times and it still occurs also i feel like the battery dies quick i wouldn t recommend this product if you want use it frequently very confusing i tried for days to make it work does not install the way they say it does i thought it would be great not to have to use so many batteries went back after two days horrible design so confusing confusing documentation you can expect to waste half the roll trying to work out how to make the dam thing work can't encourage anyone to throw away bucks on this we set it up as instructed but we keep getting a printing error also the lcd has issues piece of crap won't even turn on i tried everything to make this label work it was printing but nothing shows on label tried to switch the cassette nothing work wasted my hours i will return this product didn't work right out of the box label jam based upon other recent reviews i am reluctant to try another i ordered and of them didn't work did not work out of the package what a dud worked fairly well at first not even fine with the first tape and it's already failing it will print only halfway slanted or the tape will keep getting stuck it never prints right any longer it s very irritating and wastes sooo much tape tape doesn't feed i let them send me another same problem couldn't print one label with either one in the first few days i had it the printer went offline and wouldn't print the labels jammed i uninstalled the software and reinstalled it then it printed next day it was offline again and would not print software is simple but also lacking it can't print very far to the edges or margins the tape labels were nice quality but the machine itself was a bomb didn t work right out of the box the ocd gods are not pleased label jam error message right from the start used different cartridges and had the same message i've checked for anything that could be causing this issue with no luck checked support page for help no luck i purchased it a few months ago and it began to jam paper this dymo works for printing labels but has a few issues that make it a pain to work with the keypad on this unit is very mushy and not the easiest to use due to the mushiness it will take some time to write in the label text the power button also tends not to work well and requires a fairly aggressive press to get it started another issue with this unit is the labels tend to get jammed while being printed the way the labels exit the unit there are a few thin plastic openings in the feed path which can easily catch the tape that is being printed causing it to get jammed up and require opening to unit to fix this happened on the first print from the unit and still happens every so often the last issue is the unit fails to work with rechargable batteries nimh which have a lower voltage than alkaline will seem to work in the unit but if you try to print the motors seem to operate slower which causes it to feed the tape only a fraction of the required amount to properly function this shows a poor design that depends on a strong battery voltage to drive the motor to the appropriate speed instead of using a regulator to fix the issue and allow the use of rechargables this is not working keeps saying lable jam i was extremely disappointed as soon as i open the box this is not rechargeable buy a usb even though all the pictures show it as such and the text alludes to it this has a separate problem charger you have to use as someone who really could use a rechargeable labeler in the field i was really hoping this would be a good solution instead it just turned out to be more stuff that was going to get lost or cables i didn t need to lug around and lose batteries make more logistical sense i just received this as a gift with the tape i put the batteries and tape in then typed a few words and clicked print it made a noise and then says label jam i have taken the tape out multiple times and see no jam everything fits together nicely but i haven't been able to get this to print once very frustrating stuck on label jam even tried multiple cartiages the product looks nice and fits well in my hand i just wish it worked it might have been a fluke but i read other articles from people with the same issue i love the idea of labeling as if makes it easier for people to return things to its place but these labels fade off too quickly user friendly rarely used it but it still died with the fatal label jam error before i even got through one cartridge this labeler is by far the biggest pos i have ever purchased i bought this labeler which included one label cartridge and ordered two extra cartridges this item never worked not once the on off button was responsive maybe of the time at best batteries and cartridge were all installed properly but i could not print once not once label jam the labels were never jammed it simply did not work i tried all cartridges label jam contacted amazon and got a swift replacement guess what label jam this pos does not work at all how do they get away with selling this amazon should remove it from the site immediately i called dymo customer service and after some obvious technical troubleshooting the rep then asked me to remove all of the batteries and wait for it press the power button times wtf would that do if i didn't need a refund i'd throw this thing in the river for all intents amd purposes it does what you would expect a label maker to do it has font sizes with bold italicized and underline options options for symbols and numbers as well as one or two other basic functions as far as label makers go this one is on par with being pretty standard in other words it's good not great my main beef with it however is not with the label maker itself but with the included label tape it really sucks at being sticky the adhesive loses it's stickiness after a couple hours and the labels start to naturally peel off not good for long term labeling junk the battery would not charge it is criminal to make a device so cheaply that it has to be thrown out and take up space in a landfill absolute junk trash product cartridge which came with the brand new device didn't work after about minutes of troubleshooting kept giving jam error did independent research and only fix was to remove all the screws check for silicon debris and put it all back together yeah right i'll leave that up to the retired engineers who have time to fiddle with such messes i guess that's what product gets you it supposed to print on mm label but it can only accommodate mm also the printing area is much smaller respect mm of the label which makes it not a great product as expected by the description on mm lable it prints in two rows and microscopic brand new and all it says is 'label jam' read online this was happening to numerous people really disappointef in this label maker from the start all it says is label jam every time i try to print i tried a different cartridge and nothing this thing didn't even print me one single label returning it today worked great for a while with light use then the unit stopped working with the error battery level is too low to print why does it need a battery when it is plugged into a usb cord i'm not sure but the fact that is no longer working is a bummer because it works really well when it works also a replacement battery is more than buying a new unit grr i have never been able to get this label maker to work i've tried multiple different tape cartridges and no matter which one i try the machine keeps saying that there is a jam there is no jam the first one i received didn t work just said label jammed but it wasn t jammed we will see if the replacement works if not i will return this item update replacements unit works fine worked great for months and then kaput i guess you get what you pay for but buyer beware boo never got it work label jam dymo customer service had me on hold for minutes before i gave up guess i'll return it and try another brand product is terrible was broken out of the box for me this company needs better quality control im encouraging everyone to not buy this defective labeler i wasn't able to use it once before it told me it has a jam the instruction book doesn't even tell you how to deal with jams upon looking on the internet i found out i have to do major surgery with a tweaser don't waste your time and money to buy something that won't survive one use i'm surprised no one mentioned that the cutter cuts the labels at an angle seriously as soon as i received it it would not print label and says label jam with two brand new cassettes it is faulty and does not work had i known it didnt come with the charger i wouldnt have gotten this one requires aaa batteries or charger horrible product would not work at all label jam error keeps appearing as soon as the batteries were inserted and the device turned on definitely a waste of money you get what you pay for this machine is just okay it prints but if label making is a big deal for you spend the extra money and get a better one jammed on the first try fail this thing kinda sucks i ve been trying to get it to print consistently and is not happening i ve used two different cartridges thinking it was the cartridge itself but that didn t change anything either also i put brand new aaa batteries in it and it still is giving me a low battery warning really disappointed because if it worked it would be an awesome price for a useful gadget the printing is patchy and not solid and it s inconsistent do yourself a favor and just get the brother one also it requires triple a batteries that don t come with it that s crazy it doesn t come with a cord to charge it either or plug it into a wall i was almost wondering if there was a cord plugged in instead of batteries if it would work better i ll be returning this thing this thing is junk the battery has a short life and costs more than the label maker do not get suckered into this piece of junk i d leave stars if i could wouldn t work right out of the box label jam error message as soon as batteries and cartridge went in help center through manufacturer was offline during posted business hours forget it not worth the hassle don't buy this loaded the software and printed two labels looked great the next day we intended to use it for a large filing project and it is already broken worked for a total of two labels and since the project was delayed we are now out of return time the idea is great portable and easy the product reliability is abysmal at best very disappointed it is a really easy device to set up and use the device mounts to a windows machine as new drive letter and the free software may be launched from there my reason for only giving it two stars is that more often than not when i print a label all i get is blank label material rather than what i've asked it to print everything i've read states there is very little that can go wrong with the printer i'm using dymo labels so all i can figure is there is something wrong with a device that is meant to be foolproof doesn't work out of the box tape jam with new batteries and different cartridges motor doesn't turn the tape just got tired of trying to fix a dollar piece of junk after a half hour of poking and prodding to make it work just throwing it out cause it isn't worth the time and effort to return does not work label jam error right out of the box i love finally be able to make my own labels it is user friendly as in you don't need to read instructions the tape that came with it does not stick well unfortunately my label printer appears to be defective after loading the included label cartridge that it came with i kept getting a label cartridge jammed message weird because the cartridge and printer are brand new right well i thought maybe i'll just get another cartridge so i bought another one on amazon from a different seller i believe same problem happened it said there was a jam but there wasn't one i'm disappointed and confused not sure why my label printer will not work and continues to give me this error message i am open to any feedback or help that i might be able to receive for this issue if anyone has experienced something similar i was so excited about my label maker disappointed the labels don't stick well to anything including itself specifically i am making labels for my house wiring so don't get it for that for sure even when they appear to have stuck i go back and the label will be laying on the ground i think for the wall plates it will be fine as long as they don't get bumped the other issue is the margin of the label itself isn't adjustable so you're stuck with which in my case means cutting every label so they don't wrap on top of the text not the end of the world but a pointless limitation tried to troubleshoot this but the unit wont print i keep getting blank strips out of the device never worked since the day i received it the item doesnt work i need help with this printer the size fits my hand it's appears to be a solid hand held printer i use these on my job all the time and wanted my own but i need some help here when printing there's a thin black film that also comes out with the label and i have seen video where the white label with black lettering is printed correctly what am i doing wrong i followed the instructions on loading the cartridge and the first time i attempted printing a label it ran out about a foot of tape thanks for any assistance unable to get labeler to print even one label stating label jam no matter the cassette type put in confirmed labels are seated correctly just threw it in the trash in disgust jams of the time but you can avoid if you take the back off and help it feed pulling the label out by hand so i kept it for a while but didn't use it after i found the labels didn't stick well it has been sitting on my bench and i did try to use it today it promptly severed the print ribbon making the cartridge unusable make sure you order an extra tape because the tape that comes with the label maker doesn't work thankfully i ordered an extra one or else i could not use the product when it first came love the product otherwise tape keeps jamming i don't often write reviews but i also had a unit defective out the the box i probably won't send it back but got the label jam message as soon as i tried to use it having tried multiple times to get this device to function and only getting error messages over and over and over again i called dymo directly the tech support person was very helpful although we could not get the label maker to work correctly continuously getting error messages that there was a tape jam fortunately the company emailed me a prepaid fedex label to return the product directly to them and they will send me a brand new one i'm hoping for a positive result as i have read so many negative comments and reviews on this particular printer i'm hopeful the new one read function properly opened up and followed directions exactly and am told their is a label jam haven't even been able to print anything super disappointing but it seems a lot of other people are having the same issue i decided to purchase this after reading the reviews and the specs i loved the info i followed the badly written instructions and started the label maker and the first thing it said is label jam i opened it and inspected that i followed all the instructions carefully same issue sadly this was defective out of the box i had such high hopes for this just wanted a simple labeling machine very disappointed not buying another dymo product little tricky to use but overall is good cheap quality do not recommend for purchase nothing is jammed st time using won't print doesnt work it keeps showing tape jam error but there has no problem with the label cassette i tried multiple times and still not printing a word it will cost more than dollars to return it doa tried new batteries and this thing only would stay on a few seconds returned for refund item damaged label keep winding up in the roller have to open the back and pull it out only get good labels a third of the time it won't print and it keeps saying label jam even after i purchased another cassette so disappointed i'm not sure if it is inherit in the whole product or just the labels that came with it but the labels don't stick to metal i've tried times and they stay on about days before the ends start to come loose then they fall off within days completely useless stickers both the original unit and the replacement had the same issue indicating there was a jam before even printing a label returned and moving on it's hard to print different font styles through a computer's usb port it's time consuming better to use a label printer that has more font styles built in like a brother model that i bought this also has a very limited set of borders built in and i don't think it's possible to add more borders again my brother model has built in borders i do like the rechargeable battery brand new and it would not print due to a label jam error after lots of frustration spooling and unspooling the whole ink ribbon and troubleshooting googling finally managed to get it to print anything i wiggled the white rubber spool thing with a pencil and i guess that loosened up the motor probably won't purchase this one again so excited to use this so easy to use but when i start printing it says paper jam i did everything to fix it using the online manual i even called dymo tech support but it didn't work out im waiting for the replacement hopefully it will work as expected i've never been able to successfully tear off a label from this gadget item does not turn on when it arrived i installed the battery and charged it like the instructions said to do after pressed the power button and nothing happened i received a defective product and am very disappointed left a message to the seller and they still have not contacted me i need to look for online instructions to change the font takes getting used to they are coming off of glass spray bottles but stay on small essential oil bottles at this point i give it three stars i bought this lablemanager to lable my diy bottles of diy liquid after using this lable maker for bout a month and some change i have used only about of a roll of a the lable tape provided with the label maker and the lable will not stay attached to their bottles the glass and plastic bottles i used where purchased brand new from amazon the problem is that they are not adhesive enough to stay on the bottles i'm very disappointed in the quality of the lable tape bc it is the name brand tape which is peeling off of the bottles this very frustrating from a diy guy entrepreneurs point of view i have hd to tape the lable back on labels started to jam on second tape roll the adhesive is not strong enough to keep the labels in place on smooth faced studs i tried to use in garage shelving the label maker did not last a waste of money never got to use it since i didn't receive all the parts to my machine purchased the label maker about a year ago and only used it for times the battery die about a week ago call the manufacturer and they are sending a new battery free of change i was so excited for this label maker and when i went to make print my first label it said label jam how can there be a label jam if i've never used it there was no label jam i tried everything on any forum online i could find to fix it and nothing worked i have to return it and will try another brand i am not overly impressed with this label maker the first one i received was faulty it did not print at all though did make noises like it was trying to i attempted to use two different sets of tape and neither worked so i switched it for a new one of the same thing through amazon this one i just received and while it does print now the largest size lettering which is what i wanted to use prints extremely poorly with lots of uneven ness as if it's running out of ink also tried two different sets of tape on this device both did not print correctly images attached include prints from both tapes at pt font size at pt font size the printer will print decently still not perfect but it's at least easily legible and doesn't look like complete garbage so i will probably keep this one just to print what i need and never use it again i would probably recommend spending an additional bucks to get a much better label maker than this this is the second dymo we buy this one doesn't seem to have a clear button so i have to delete every word one by one which is time consuming and annoying when making many labels it also has a battery that doesn't last so that's not good either we thought we were upgrading from our first dymo to this one but i would not recommend this at all this label maker did not work for me when i put the cartridge on and tried to print something i kept getting a message that the cartridge was jammed i would check it and nothing stood out as a possible reason for this to be jammed finally after about minutes of just reinserting the cartridge it finally started to print however the printing was disappointing it was barely printing anything on the label most came out almost blank and some were completely blank the cartridge itself comes in a cardboard box that is open on ends it's not sealed in any packaging i'm wondering if the ink gets dried out since it is exposed to air and not sealed in anyway i will be returning this and i do not recommend this the description states single unit includes labelmanager label maker d starter label cassette black on white x ' quick start guide year limited warranty perhaps i'm a fool but i interpret the d starter label cassette black on white to mean that it comes with a starter label cassette it came with none meaning this device is absolutely useless to me the device looks nice but i can't attest to how it works because i have no labels i'm beyond disappointed the one i receive was defective i have no time of returning its garbage broken on arrival with label jam error i also bought in ribbon and it jammed but they won't exchange it also the labelmaker does not have instruction had to go to internet to review the lithium battery eventually died on me i only had the this printer for about months little did i know that the unit constantly needs charging once i determined that battery was dead i thought i could simply re charge it by plugging it in nope the software says that the battery is pretty much dead the replacement battery costs almost double of this unit not very happy portable never worked got a replacement and it did not work either i am done with dymo i now have extra tapes i can't use that i will have to pay to return great customer service but this is not a plug and play for mac very disappointed i was not able to use it because the software just would not work spent all morning on it waste of time terrible doesn't work i put label cartridges in tried different brand new ones and it says label jam and will not print will not buy again it was great but stopped working after a month and a half makes labels ok but there is no backlighting on the screen so it is not easy to see it also does not come with an adapter requires batteries if it drains batteries when not in use then this could be a very pricey convenience it will serve the purpose but honestly expected better new out of the box it came up with error crc followed all sources to fix but this junk stuck there if you allow the battery to die you are sol if the battery dies the whole machine is dead the battery that it uses is no longer available from the dymo site it is available here at amazon for costs more than a new machine i guess for the price it is okay but i would not buy this again and i do not recommend it to anyone else the next labeler i get will have an ac adapter of course it costs more but i won't have to worry about such a delicate and rare battery when it worked it worked pretty good that's the only good thing i can say about it either arrived broken or the machine is of low quality the motor is too weak to pull the label out you can hear it making noise but the film label is not pushing out its piece of crap dont buy it terrible got jammed on the first try of the label marker and cassette tried everything to fix it and customer service was unhelpful don't bother wasting your money and get something else stopped printing only shoots out blank labels help product is a great product allows for nice labeling however product doesn t come with a charger so i purchased a charger in hopes that it could charge and i could use the item in different rooms low and behold the charger i purchased for dollars was worthless as well because the dyno label manager requires batteries no matter what unless you feel like bringing a charger cord with you everywhere and staying plugged into a wall be ready to buy a pack of aaa batteries it didn't work for me really upset about this product i tried to print and nothing i change new cassettes and nothing not worth any penni does not work with mac sierra literally had to uninstall and reinstall to get it working every time and even that stopped working eventually i cannot give a review since there were no instructions in the package i have been unable to use it sadly it does not work with macs you can't even install the 'special' program that is supposed to run on a mac looks good the idea is great just not for mac users junk used it only a couple times and any time you use the large font there is a huge line through the middle of the lettering or cuts off the top really bad product the tape comes out black whenever i try to print it worked then i changed the batteries and it stopped working it became very glitchy and the printer just keeps getting jammed i have a ton of label cassettes left too bummer also the labels didn t stick very well so poor quality i team was sold as new but it was a used item the label provided was located in the machine and the worst part is that it came damaged would not turn on either with batteries or electrical cord it didn't work right out of the box doesn't print anything on the label there are some issues with this product first they made the display of the type size almost unreadable maybe that's so you don't notice that when you change colors of tape the unit mysteriously resets just that one setting back to so that you waste a label odd that it's the only setting it changes and i didn't change tape sizes next when you change tape there is a stop placed in the tape loading chamber that makes it feel like it's inserted all the way when it isn't so it also invariably jams or prints the first label crooked wasting a label if you check it by pushing hard on the cartridge you will discover it snaps in again a second time next on some size fonts it leaves an unprinted stripe down the middle of the tape wasting a label next i read the questions and ratings and someone had asked if it wasted label tape like the predecessor dymo label maker by leaving big blank areas on both sides of the printing and the answer was no but that was not my experience it left a full half inch regardless of printing size finally the keyboard is buggy sometimes you will hit a letter and it won't register even though the keys have a definite input feedback so that you know you pressed them completely other times it enters two letters instead of just one so you waste another label so to me it seems like these issues are all designed into the product to waste label tape i turn it on and when i type something in and hit print it shuts right back off i bought mine at staples sadly this broke after just a few uses this may be one of the worst purchases my brother la le maker broke after many years so i went for a quick cheap option bad idea it doesn't print fully and the tape keeps getting stuck in the machine every time time for a refund on this one this review is for the model i somehow didn't notice that this unit uses a proprietary rechargeable battery i probably wouldn't have ordered it had i noticed something like this that may only get occasional use using a rechargeable lithium battery is just asking for trouble trouble like discharging when idle in a desk drawer i just found that the battery is down after sitting for a couple weeks unused having only been asked to print one wide label as a test prior to being stored trouble like chargers that disappear mine already has before i even managed to reach two uses and i don't have an ac adapter handy that fits the jack and even aftermarket replacements are barely less than the cost of the unit trouble like having to replace the battery module eventually and i note that dymo asks significantly more for the replacement battery than for the hardware itself which means that most users will just order a whole new unit which translates to an awful lot of these ending up in landfills prematurely and i guarantee this big hunk of plastic isn't biodegradable none of this is great news the other bad news the adhesive on the d tape is pretty weak it won't hold on ziploc freezer bags and dymo hasn't provided so much as a period key or slash on the keyboard any punctuation mark is going to require at least three button presses probably more while you select your punctuation mark from the punctuation menu did it ever occur to dymo that people might often want to include y'know dates on their labels i gambled on this vs a brother product i'm frankly kind of sorry i did edit i posted this review on september two days later i found the power supply charger i labeled it clearly with the labelmaker though the label barely stuck to that either then charged up the unit fully its second full charge since my receipt of the device the first week of september and set it aside today october i picked up the labelmaker to print a label for the first time since its full charge on it has been off and unused for days the unit powered up for seconds then flashed charge battery and turned off my day return window ended days ago do not buy this unit i've dropped my rating from stars to bought on jul used it to print only around labels only owned it for days before it stopped charging it will no longer charge at all very disappointed can't use it when it will not charge i am not impressed with the label maker it was delivered at the end of july in which i made labels i went to use it yesterday and it said it needed charging label maker will not hold a charge not real sure what needs replacing the battery or the charger i would not purchase this again it has been just over year since i purchased this dymo product and it sadly has died it was fun while it lasted now i have a bunch of tape cartridges and no label printer poor communication with computer windows driver updated but still hard to get connection does not print labels i sat here for an hour trying to get it to work searched online and found that this is a common problem only suggestion is to make sure the cartridge is pushed all the way in i did this many times as well as changed the batteries and wasted more money on new cartridges assuming it was an old one nope no luck waste of money very disappointed the label maker worked ok for a bit then it stopped moving the tape through properly i opened the back and there is nothing obstructing the tape from moving it's pretty worthless now sad that after limited use in months that it's no longer working the product description for the labelmanager states that it can also be powered and recharged via the included ac power adapter this is not true the unit must have a charged battery to operate if you try and run it with no battery or a battery that is completely discharged you will get the message charge battery when you try to turn it on even with a partially charged battery you may get the message wait x minutes battery charging it uses the same overpriced and nasty proprietary battery as the dymo labelmanager pnp and that unit is notorious for having the battery die if you frequently allow it to discharge the first thing you'll want to do with this unit is print a label that says 'keep plugged in to remind you not to let the battery go flat short version the power adapter is only for charging the battery it cannot power it alone so you need to keep this plugged in when you're not using it unless you like having to wait when you need a label still a very good label maker for the current price hence stars but be aware that the product description on amazon is wrong the description on the dymo website does not say it can be powered by the power adapter so amazon need to correct the listing the tape gets stuck often and the symbols are really annoying to get to i guess you get what you pay for when it's working it's just ok would not recommend i can't figure out how to use this non easy to use label maker how do you mark an item easy to use when it's the furthest thing from the truth even if it's user error it still sucks because it's very nice looking or simply looks like it should be working right out of the box next time just offer that didn't work out of the package i suspect it's the roll of label material that came with the unit have not tried another roll to see if that is the issue refuses to print on labels even with brand new batteries first not sure why this thing needs aaa batteries i mean why can't it make like aa or aaa i mean come on second the label that comes with it does not stick very well broke after one roll of labels now instead of printing the label just bunches up too late to return ymmv i purchased this to make labels of course i used batteries but after leaving them in for months they corroded in the battery department i then had to buy the cord to get it to work this label maker has some problem after using it on both windows and mac it seems to have similar limitations on both the print head on the device will not always engage after clicking print it is not uncommon for the mechanically lifted to remain retracted while the tape is fed and ejected still blank this problem can be overcome if the user opens the side panel pushes and holds the print head to engage before clicking print if the usb device is ejected the computer must be re started before the label maker can be 'discovered' again this may be a driver problem but it occurs on both win and mac computers dymo label maker software is not intuitive labels require multiple clicks before the text is editable the interface seems to be the same for both win and mac when it works the labels are nice and clear small black and white user made graphics can be added the variety of color tapes is nice kind of crappy bought b c rated highly here but really it's cheapo labels don't stick well characters are not easily findable it's worth it to buy something more expensive that's actually a quality product don't buy this product if you are not going to use it almost every day i bought it on august i used it to create labels for my school i am a spanish teacher it used it a lot during the first months then in the last six months i haven't used it today august is not working i downloaded new drivers and nothing of course the warranty is only for one year and mine has expired a week ago what a coincidence it was an easy product to use but if you want something for more than just an occasion look somewhere else this labeler seems to work ok but the tape that came with it won't stick to anything including itself i hope that by tossing the cartridge that came with it and putting a new cartridge in will make it what i was expecting it to be in the first place useful worked at first then stopped printing useless now but can't bring myself to throw it out because of all the extra tape i bought ok label maker the labels seem to get stuck a lot though this is for the plug n play version battery dies will not charge and makes item unusable had to throw it in the trash dont waste your money on this one easy to use and works well just too much front and back wasted tape i purchased the printer and have a mac osx sierra installed i cannot for the life of me get the printer to say it's online i've read some forums saying that theres some version of the software that i need to use with sierra but those articles where written forever ago can you please help me to understand why the plug n play might not be working i've never had an issue with my usb ports on the computer like this easy to use did not come with starter roll of tape as it said in description do not waste your time with this product it is a knock off and a badly done one at that this actual item sells for bucks from the manufacturer and other retailers it jammed everytime garunteed there is a very obvious physical flaw in the design of the knock off that does not allow the label paper to come out of the top there's a big piece of plastic holding the paper in which then makes the label roll in the wheel that is supposed to move the paper up the pictures are hard to see but there is no excuse for something not working straight out of the box don't get an amazon knock off just spend bucks on the real item i'd give it no stars of possible should have listened to other people's reviews quality of labels was bad not clear and barely legible kept getting message that batteries were low even though they were new wish they had negative star ratings i bought this in and only used it a handful of times took it out today to use it and it's flashing hw err flash which after researching online is some sort of fatal error code garbage like it but wish it took wider labels should have read description better i don't know if i recieved a defective one but this would not print out any labels no matter what i tried i even went to the manufacturers website for help and that didn't work did not work with computer at first i thought it was human error turns out this product is terrible i bought this label maker in july used it a handful of times charged it and boxed it up until next time the next time that i opened the box maybe months later it would not hold a charge at all the icon wouldn't even blink when it was connected the bars of the battery getting filled up nothing just dead i ordered another one the price was right and i thought i might have just gotten a lemon the first time around new unit arrives i plugged it in but something was wrong almost immediately the unit display would say charging please wait x minutes and then i would look over a few seconds later and it wouldn't be charging at all we finally figured out that it is very finicky about how it is plugged in and ultimately gave up as it would require constant supervision while charging as a result i am returning the unit that showed up today and tossing my older but identical unit away i even tried a multi volt ac adapter to get it to charge but it is just unresponsive in summation i do not recommend this label maker for anything other than being used as a paperweight product never worked its pretty good once you get the hang of how it works not too user friendly if you don't have some smarts you wont figure out all of the features for a while maybe after a few tries it doesn't work the label doesn't feed through even though the reviews said it came with a roll of label tape it didn't more than that nearly no one carried the kind of label tape it takes i ended up having to buy a new label maker to have it when i needed it for the kid's school supplies it was a waste of my money i'm pretty sad about this product i loved the idea of being able to organize a bunch of things i ordered and used it once worked great set it on a shelf for a few weeks went back to use it again and now it won't print i can still type in what i want to label but when i hit the print button it tries to but nothing comes out i even replaced the full box of tape with a new one to see if that would help still doesn't work i would live to trade it in for a replacement since it hasn't been a year yet but i can't find a way to do that its not my computer never seems to recognize it is plugged in this product has been a huge disappointment i was actually going to try to return it but i missed my window of opportunity i bought this less than a month ago used the second time i can't print no more there is a message label jam i replaced a new cartridge but still saying label jam returning it now i got two of these things one of which was a replacement neither worked with ac dc adapters and would literally go through a whole set of new batteries in a matter of seconds not even one label could be printed before they would die because of dead batteries the machine was broken and stopped working two weeks after i bought it i used it times only not happy with it at all i never had a label maker before and this one claims to be easy to use there were no directions at all and even though i figured out how to load the tape and batteries and turn it on i have no idea how to make it work it is a total waste and a total disappointment there has to be a better and simpler way to make labels than this i wasted my money and worse my time i'm sure this device normally works fine however the cartridge i received with it got tangled in the machine and i was unable to get even a single label out of the thing i should be able to snap the cartridge in and use it i spent minutes trying to figure it out and failed i'll update my review if i try again with another cartridge awkward to hold and the tape has this weird carbon layer the comes out the cutter is in a stance place so if you have a short label you almost have to tip it out i have at least different machines between my classroom and house this is my least favorite one tape it came with also scratches off very strange it worked great for the first roll that was included once it was time for another roll it stopped dispensing the tape this review is even much later than when it stopped working i bought more rolls thinking those may have been the issue but it still does the same thing product did not print i thought maybe something was wrong with the ink cartridge so i purchased a ne cartridge and it still did not work waste of money i bought this to use on field visits to label our equipment so i needed something small portable and did not need an external power source for those qualities this product is good it is simple and relatively easy to use i had a small but huge problem with it in the field where something about the files caused me to have to delete and reinstall or something i don't remember exactly but it was time consuming and frustrating it does not need a separate power source it runs off of usb and so i can easily use my laptop couple downsides does not warn you when your label tape is about out or even out you will just notice when your label is cut off very frustrating if you are printing a list of labels and it runs out a couple in also while you are able to save label formats it saves it to the computer not the machine so you will need to set up the formats on each computer you use overall it serves its purpose works fine but the aaa batteries became more of an inconvenience that i thought it would be i already have a bunch of aa eneloops but now i have to buy a bunch of aaa eneloops this was great at first however was very short lived i honestly printed labels tops and it is already not working i've purchased multiple new cartridges to see if that's the issue and nothing gets it to print very disappointing labeler tends to jam and labels that come with it fall off scam sorry i didn't read the reviews first the printer works well but i have been looking for mo on how to reduce margins on left right major tape waste i would give it or stars if someone could tell me how to adjust the margins it runs on dymo label light maybe if there were another driver software to use difficult to understands instruction on line and not clears not for people without computer skills no learning curve for me it just worked i exhausted my complimentary roll quickly went to purchase a normal stock roll the store wanted more for the new tape than i paid for the whole printer with the complimentary roll at the same store just a month earlier their printer and complimentary tape bundle is today still cheaper than the refill cartridge that stinks bought the new roll instead of a whole new printer printed a few labels then because i was to move to a new apartment i packed the printer up when i unpacked the printer to use it it ate up the label and snapped the ribbon so the replacement cartridge is now useless works adaquetly but poor instructions good deal for the price looked good great price never recieved it knew it was too food to be true complete crap fatal hw err flash error the moment i turned it on my printer arrived a few days ago and i am still unable to print any labels as advised i downloaded and installed an update to my mac but the update couldn't find my printer even though the printer is plugged directly into my computer via a usb port the box in which the product came contains no troubleshooting info or anything after trying to solve the problem on my own testing usb ports cables etc i submitted a request for help i was not reassured when i could not find this product as a possible choice on any of the pull down menus for submitting help requests in the meantime i tried to find label cartridges for the printer i could find very few in the size i need and none in the color combination i wanted yellow blue or white on clear tape even though they are listed as options i am curious to see if dymo com responds to my request and if they can solve the printer problem and explain why it's near impossible to find printer cartridges for in tape if i do not hear from them in hours i'll return the printer of course if i get positive results i'll post what happened here as a follow up i offer this account to help others make an informed decision about choosing a label printer tried times and ink is very light print out is still ineligible machine kept showing no battery even after i just purchased and new battery and replaced nice but goes through aaa batteries like crazy and has a very finicky ac adapter port i used to like this thing but after a couple years it keeps getting jammed and wasting tons of labels it really frustrating and has gotten to the point where it just won't spool out a label it was great while it lasted the screen developed lines through it right after the return period was up pros great price great if you get one without flaws cons chews through aaa batteries wish it had rechargeable or aa batteries screen did not last very long i had to use capital letters to read what i wanted to print cartridge jams to easily so i wasted quite a bit of tape i didn't even get through the second cartridge before it stopped working the cartridge tape it came with is much shorter than the replacements i didn't even get through my labeling before it became inoperable as you can see in the picture there is tape in the cartridge but it says jammed there is no visible jam i put off using this for too long use yours a lot when you get it so you know if you got a defect before the return time passes i would appreciate comments on a label printer that worked for you and didn't fail with light use horrible i put it together and it was already broken it's printing a line in the middle of the text but works for what i need this worked well for what i needed for the year that i owned it giving it stars because within a year or so it seemed to cause the batteries to burst and made it stop working i was able to clean out the battery acid and got it to work for a few more weeks but then the same issue happened again which caused it to stop working i'm going to look at one of the higher end label printers you connect to a printer instead as i don't want to fuss with a label printer every year tape gets caught constantly have to take it apart and redirect the labels poor design but when it prints on track it works as advertised this label maker doesn't work you ant read the words every time you print tape constantly gets jammed even after ensuring the tape is in the guide and the ribbon is tightened when i thought i finally had it set just so it somehow cut the carbon tape now i have black tape stuck to my label in addition to having to pry the back of the unit open every seconds to un jam the tape i am sending mine back printing is not clear spacing between letters it completely inconsistent and the ink keeps getting lodged in the device or coming out still attached to label did not cut the label triple a batteries that won't last long so i bought the power adapter to save money on batteries and the power plug doesn't work i would not recommend this product to anyone bought one in it worked fine at first in less than a year of minimal use one of the springs inside battery compartment got rusty and broke off i bought an adapter recently so i can still use it adapter worked it's the dymo label maker itself that refuses to the lcd shows it's turned on but none of the buttons works so disappointed i can only assume everyone is posting positive reviews of this product before the battery died i loved it until that moment myself after the battery died i found myself asking the common existential question one asks in these situations why does a usb label printer need a battery in the first place why would it refuse to print if the battery was dead when it was clearly powered why are these batteries why are these batteries impossible to find at any price the answer i supposed is obvious they expect to just buy a new one for roughly more then the battery would cost just to be clear this product essentially has a built in kill switch so it will die after a year or two no matter how much or how little you use it brother makes a similar product for just a little more money i would recommend that typical dymo interface problems with mac equipment after setup this label printer would eject tape when the print icon was pushed but there was no printing on tape just one wasted piece of blank tape after another so i downloaded dymo's latest software version from the dymo website thinking maybe a dymo software upgrade would fix his malady this did not fix the no print issue and erased all of my mac printer interfaces an epson wf a dymo large format twin turbo and a brother laser printer i had reload all printer interfaces from scratch over many years i have yet to install any dymo equipment without major issues so you gotta ask yourself why dummy do you keep trying to use dymo equipment sending back to amazon immediately if you have mac equipment please do not buy dymo products but if you decide this could never happen to me well it most likely will and you qualify for a slow learner hat too by today's standards entry of information is clumsy and slow no clear sharp fonts here either on the screen still i fumbled through entering information for labels until suddenly the machine would not let me change the size of a font from stuck on no point in trying to print a label with a font the size of incredibly small this machine is a piece of junk that is now useless works well only caveat i've found is that you waste a lot of tape because the label doesn't automatically advance to be cut out still for the price it was a good buy not even months and already does not work i purchased item used but really disappointed it has already stopped working i purchased a brand new one in and it lasted years i expected this to last at least years while it dies print labels it is built cheaply and it shows if left to sit it will develop a sticking problem which causes the unit to not be able to print simply showing a jam error the only way i've found to solve this is to give it a couple good hard thwacks on the palm of your hand the problem will inevitably reappear though would recommend not to buy this model otherwise prints fine when working huge piece of junk what a waste of money i put new amazonbasics batteries in this and everytime i press the print button the printing head moves slightly and then the screen reads label jam i have tried with various batteries and two different roles of printing tape turning it off and on but nothing fixes it i wasted my money please don't waste yours it never worked it would not print a label and would not push out any tape i used brand new batteries for it i am not sure if it is the cartridge or the machine itself disappointed to say the least i have three of these and they all failed within the first year the battery stops charging and the software won't print without a charged battery even connected to usb for power there is something misdesigned or broken in dymo's battery charger or battery and there's no way to bypass it and just use usb for power there's no way to add an ac adapter or charge the battery externally very poor design why does a usb connected label printer need a battery at all the printer itself worked great while it lasted be careful amazon has combined the entire dymo label printer line under one heading so these reviews are all for different unit models i wish amazon would fix this as these are unrelated products the product has not work since i purchased this contacted the company a few times and went through a month or two of troubleshooting realized recently that this product is missing the lithium battery i've tried contacting the company many times and never heard back very disappointed with the product a waste of money the lithium battery costs as much as product i want my refund the buttons on this are hard to clean they are a rubber surface dust gets stuck on them and microfiber cloth doesn't help to wipe it clean otherwise product works fine looks like a nice device if only the keyboard were not scrambled when i press a i get q when i press q i get a when i press z i get w when i press m i get the symbol menu when i press the symbol menu i get m a zwerty keyboard is a new thing for me this goes straight back really dymo no qa whatsoever i'm disappointed with this label printer it's supposedly a bluetooth wireless printer but the bluetooth connectivity is not reliable i've wasted a lot of time trying to get it to print by bluetooth with little luck i have to plug it in with the usb cord to print this wouldn't be too much of an issue except that the usb is also the battery charger bad design fault there should be a separate battery charging cord or the usb should charge the battery while plugged into a a computer i'm using it for now as i don't have time to research and buy another though if i get the time before the return window closes then it's getting sent back update dymo sent me a replacement of this model which also had the same issues they then sent me a replacement which is their bluetooth printer you can print to from mobile devices it has had issues on and off and now printed a garbled mess and then the tape completely jammed up i can't get the cassette out and am stuck at the end of my business day scrambling to print labels for orders on sheet labels in my regular printer end result while they do have great service they do not have great products all label printers have been garbage and i've wasted an far too much of my work time on the phone with customer service do not buy dymo printers i bought this to label wires in an auto wiring harness i'm creating foldover flags on the wires unfortunately the adhesive doesn't stick to itself so the labels are coming unstuck after a few hours would like to know if there's a label tape that will stick to itself better it prints labels fine they come out fine but the adhesive on the labels is lacking half of my labels had to be taped over so they wouldn't fall off after a week returned software would not load i've been using this for several months now it's generally ok but there are a couple of annoying attributes there's no one button clear function why not common non alpha characters are hard to find and insert why not use the shift key paradigm that everyone is used to unfortunately this product never worked for me the first time that i took it out of the original packaging it came up with an error message i had a chat with the dymo help center and they were not able to help me other people seem to have had great success with this label maker but sadly i bought a paperweight works great at most time but sometimes the paper got stucked into the printer and it feeds inside the printer instead of outside causing it to jam up not so easy to use stopped working after two years creates great labels once you figure out how to use it the directions are basically nonexistent unless you want a computer not exactly user friendly but does do a good job bought this for household use took more than a few times to get it to work had to troubleshoot more than i expected but ultimately got it to work when all the stars are pointed in the right direction it works i love it when it works it was supposed to be compatible with my imac i had to spend hours with customer service at demo to get it to aligned then it worked every time i used it my regular printer was knocked off line then i had to spend time with customer service for the epson printer i thought it had something to do with the printer so i returned the epson i bought a hp which when its not knocked off line is at least a little more user friendly than the epson i would really like to return the dymo but the return window is closed maybe someone out there can help meanwhile i am back to using my brother label maker that i've had for years however now its giving me a problem and i have to contact them too i don't recommend buying this label maker primarily because once the lithium ion battery fails your replacement is the same price as a new unit second reason like most label makers it wastes almost a in of tape before and after the print area this thing is a paperweight installed and work for night now i get so aggravated with i give up mines did not work upon arrival i cannot make a refund or return because i have thrown the box away it does not print well maybe a defective product there was no user manual inside the box and i've followed the one online but still did not print very clearly or well could it be because of low battery don't waste your money the lithium ion battery doesn't last and there is not replacement for it or at least the replacements cost just as much as the label maker horrible it prints decent labels when you can get it to otherwise the tape gets stuck as it prints and doesn't actually come out the designated slot it rolls inside the machine and jams or doesn't print evenly i will be trashing it and getting the name brand what a waste of money well not a good review no power cord and no tape as promised why would you sell something with out the needed items to use it returning i loved this item and it broke so easily on me completely stopped working for no reason i have tried everything this was supposed to be plug and play with mac or pc i have a mid macbook bro the dymo light software didn't even work this is the software that pops up when you plug in the device and enter it so i downloaded and installed the full version i was happy that the full version appeared to make the labeler work so st day i made a bunch of labels and i was satisfied but irritated the lite version of the software wouldn't work the next day i tried to make more labels and my computer keeps telling me that in order to run the dymo app i need to have an installed labeler or printer so i called tech support who simply explained that these units uninstall themselves and won't recognize again if it's newer ios i think this is a major oversight from the manufacturer seller this unit shouldn't fail to work because i have the newer ios software hope the fix the problem i ended up exchanging one for another and then ultmately returning both i purchased the aaa batteries and installed it came without instructions when i tried to print it said install cassette it came without a cassette it is not working it was working fine and then all of a sudden it would no longer print it would make the sound as if it were printing but nothing moved and nothing can out i have purchased several d tapes for this and still the same thing this was only my second time using it i will send this back i really thought i got a good deal after less than a year the battery will not fully charge making the printer a paperweight i would not recommend buying this printer because design flaw jams every time it is used very disappointed when a label is able to be made turns out quite nice i haven't used the product very often i now tried to use it although the screen says 'printing' the tape does not come up it is not jammed just will not advance i changed the cartridges and it still does not work doesn't work just keeps saying label jammed very frustrating i've been trying to make it work for a few days and it won't unjam now the ribbon is just a mess when i hit the print button the machine turns off so i'm returning the machine very disappointed does not work i initially loved this label maker great price and simple to use but the adhesive on the actual labels do not stick over time i labeled some dvd cases and after a few days all the labels fell off so disappointed missleading under the product description it clearly states that one small starter roll is included it was not i will not recommend purchasing anything from a dishonest brand like this one i love using this super easy and helps keep things organized my only issue with it is actually in the product description posted on amazon i think people have posted about several different models on this product page this model does not have more than one font choice it's a very basic sans serif arial maybe with a set of icons so if you're looking for flexibility on looks i might get something different but for the price it's pretty good and it does come with a black letter on white tape roll so no need to order one unless you are sure you will need more soon it was broken from day one so disappointing and i couldn't return it unfortunately this label maker jams quite regularly and as a result i wasted a great deal of label and time i've never had a label maker jam with this frequency i do not recommend this product the gadget works but good luck learning how to use it the instructions are terrible bought this for a project and when i am about to use this doesnt come with a charger and uses triple aaa batteries ughghguigigiihgihgih so of course i had neither so i couldnt use this straight out of the box i am having major issues with this machine the tape keeps getting sucked into a roller inside and nothing that i print comes out on its own i have to take the back cover off and pull the tape out of the side i like the different options but it is just too frustrating to use lettering fussy do not download and install dymo application on your computer impossible to remove icons even after uninstalling program not that useful made the entire purchase a bad experience wish i had never purchased this item out of box repeatedly printed part of desired label with majority of label illegible product used once cutter does not pull up by itself it gets stuck the labelmanager was disappointing right out of the box it made three labels and the software internal to the unit failed on the next startup the unit was unusable however there is a good story here dymo owned by rubbermaid has a wonderful customer service they sent me a new unit and a prepaid fedex label for the return of the failed unit the new unit failed upon startup with software errors and melted a new label cartridge customer service was just a helpful with this new failure they sent me a replacement cartridge and noting the second failure sent a newer and better labelmaker as well as all the prepaid shipping dymo customer service is the saving grace of this story and the new upgraded labelmanager is working well it didn't come with batteries you need aaa batteries i will come back to rate it as soon as i get my batteries this sucks i've had this printer for about a year and a half and found it useful i liked that it was usb powered took up little desk space and had easy to use windows software today i attempted to print and found that the internal li ion battery had failed the battery will no longer hold a charge and this prevents the printer from working why in the world is this a battery powered device in the first place there is no user interface on it the only time it is useful is when it is plugged into a usb power which is presumably attached to a laptop desktop which is providing it power the battery part number is w and is available for sale at dymo com for shipping this is the same price i originally paid for the entire printer i don't mind so much paying inflated pricing for the printing tape but to be also dinged for a battery every year or two ain't cool i bought this label maker last july and haven't used it very much but of course when i really needed it i ran out of tape so i got on amazon right away and ordered it after i refilled the tape and made one label the battery died i was surprised when i found that it used a rechargeable battery that didn't come with a charger when i notified the manufacture their response was that i had to buy that separately for an extra no where in the product description did it say that why in the world would they sell this without a charger had i know that i never would have bought this the label maker it's self is difficult to use and the tape is falling off the stuff i used it on so there's no way i'm throwing another at this piece of crap i don't know about you but i think that is just wrong it's a great label maker if speed is not an issue but the battery leaves much to be desired i barely made it through one day and one drawer of files and the battery indicator became low and it became very temperamental with it's printing and charging i figured since it was plug and play it got power from my computer so why did it need a battery i don't want anything battery dependent when it comes to label printing i want that label maker to be quicker than i can type it and this label maker disappointed me you have to type it print it cut it by pushing another button peel the backing paper split in the middle two slits to peel then stick it i guess if you have the time all this is okay but i do file organization and want something a bit more dependable and faster the label tape keeps jamming when i try to print no matter if i try to reset cartridge it continues to jam will be returning tl dr good labeler awful lifespan as a labeler this is a great affordable little machine it's easy to use and fast to print however after a year and a half of moderate use it ceased to print thinking it was out of label stock we replaced the cartridge but with no luck after several messages with dymo's customer support failed to resolve the issue they told me the labeler was out of warranty and i was out of luck that's not a very good lifespan for a such a low impact machine hence the two stars the back of the tape that comes with this thing can barely be classified as adhesive insofar as sometimes the tape sticks for a brief period slowly curls away from the surface then falls or skips the brief sticking phase and just goes straight to falling to the ground otherwise the label maker seems to be pretty high functioning it offers a lot of options for characters and symbols to put on your labels but these features are kind of pointless if the labels don't stick to anything it drains the batteries really quick can't get it to print for the minutes that the dymo labelmanager pnp label maker worked i liked it my guess is that the battery is defective and will not hold a charge fortunately i could return it stupid battery once the battery dies that's it the machine is useless no battery no label a new battery costs more than the machine i'm stuck with extra labels but no machine the battery will die eventually but when it does throw out the machine this labeler did not work we tried to print and the tape came out blank every time we printed a defective product do not buy we wasted our money on this and tape rolls didn't get it returned in time each time i would try to print a label the label maker would shut off i called their support line and explained that when i pressed the print button the machine would turn off the tech from dymo asks me if i was using new alkaline batteries requires aaa batteries i told him yes i just installed new batteries that i purchased from costco a week ago he then asks me what the brand of the batteries were i told him they were kirkland brand he then proceeds to tell me that i should only be using duracell brand batteries for their product since the print function requires a lot of power to print a label really i have never heard of a product that will only work with one particular brand of battery needless to say if dymo designs their label makers to only work using duracell brand of battery i will not be buying their products anymore item was returned the next day thank you amazon for crediting back my account and providing much better customer service than dymo we chose to buy this after previous identical began to malfunction for the price satisfactory a pain to use i returned this unit so i can't comment on it's functionality summary minimum whitespace margins on a label are unless you cut it to size yourself it does print labels in my case i did need to install the mac software since i frequently need to print a non latin language but i knew this beforehand the sw itself is ok although much more confusing than it should be so why only stars the labels are useless for labeling cables which was one of the main reasons i got the device a when curved around a typical thickness electronics cable they don't stay stuck to it and peel off in less than a day b it's almost impossible to position the tape so it overlaps exactly on itself without leaving one sided sticky surfaces as soon as the two sticky sides touch good luck on re positioning as a result while the print quality itself is good labels on cables still look messy and unprofessional the minimum label length is h u g e i want to label many small items large ish usb thumb drives key tags etc a typical label i'd want to make would be point characters this is a cm just under long text but the minimum amount of white space around it comes to another cm so wastage it's not just a matter of wasting material and added tape costs i virtually always need to cut labels with scissors by hand after printing simply to get labels small enough this is both a hassle and makes for crooked cut messy result yes i'm not great with fine fingerwork if i were i wouldn't need a labelmaker in the first place and would just hand cut sticky address labels it's possible to at least eliminate the wastage by printing multiple labels at a time but that doesn't solve the neat cut problem from my pov this ruins of the purpose of the device and i wouldn't have bought it had i known and i bought this over a brother system label maker because of comments that this was much better in that respect dymo should publish the minimum margins of the device just like printer manufacturers do received product with jammed tape advance gear took unit apart to free up the gear the product seems to work properly now the labels look great i would think that dymo tests this units before releasing to the market i thought i was ordering a raised letter with sticky backed tape not at all the letters are too small even at the highest setting they still only take up the tape size so if you are looking for easy to read labels from a small distance this labeler is not so good if just looking for small height letters because you have super vision or size is not important this is an ok machine better items for similar price on market i had a hard time keeping the tape from jamming i wasted a lot of tape to get it to work and it still doesn't if it wasn't outside the return window i would return it it doesn't work at all i want to return it this label printer failed at its core function it would not print labels at all i returned it it prints labels and cuts cleanly i don't care for the split cut backing of the labels that makes you peel the sticker twice this makes small labels no fun at all to make there is no clear all function to start a new label if you are making long part number or two line labels and such get ready to press and hold the backspace for a long time after each label i've never owned a label maker without a clear all function also the dash is hidden or pages into the symbols this is used as commonly as numerals why did they make the greek alphabet symbols easier to get to add clear all and dash to the keyboard and you have a winner didnt work after awhile papers run out but it doesnt print the text waste of money i wanted to love this label maker and i did for days then it died on me and it stopped working even after replacing the batteries i'm so disappointed i bought my first dymo label maker in about sold kids their name on labels until the school principal confiscated my label 'gun i've owned many units over the past years never been disappointed until now every label i've made with the demo tape has curled up and become unattached i prepare the surfaces before attaching it's just bad or 'aged' adhesive very disappointing i have brother units but bought the ole standby again i've ordered more tape and hope it's better as it couldn't be worse three stars for the machine none for the tape doesn't work when trying to print nothing is printed the paper spits out like it should however the paper is blank after attempting to print there's a low battery indicator that shows up right after printing even with brand new batteries i've even tried different paper cartridges with the same outcome label tape gets out of alignment one out of every five labels so far this was a gift for my former step grand daughter not as good as the original book but it is informative on the things it has some are missing that were in the first book and some are new the book information is wonderful but i received the book damaged this book does have a lot of helpful information particularly about the metaphysical healing properties of stones and i liked the inclusion of crystal shapes in the back to go over the different shapes what was lacking for me was any context for the healing properties i understand a lot of information needed to be put into this small book but i felt like the properties were just sort of stated and not given any history or reasoning it felt kind of like a list in paragraph form especially if it was a healing property that i had never associated with that stone i wanted to know where that came from or why i hate to say it because in general i think she's great but i feel like it was kind of like info i could have gotten from google okay but wasn't quite what i expected i needed more individual info on the rocks crystals this is strictly metaphysical and doesn't even have all of the items listed that i was looking for the photos get a zero star the images are limited very dark and flat they do not do the stones justice i am familiar with most and they would not serve as a means to identify stones for a beginner the written information is decent so it's too bad that the poor images take away from the strength of this book they all look like dark mud the colorful cover is deceptive way more about crystal healing than i thought it would be not a good reference book for rocks and minerals at all all photos are of tumbled stones so it doesn't help identify and all info is about mystical power great book i was expecting it to be a little bigger and more detailed but overall quite a good basic guide the book has good information in it but does not cover all stones my book love is in the earth does a match better job so my girlfriend recommended this book to me because i just got into meditation and i wanted to get some crystals to help me out on my journey i think the book is informative but didn t have a lot of the crystals that i m familiar with inside and the ones that are in the book are hard to find in local shops for such a packed book i find it too ackward to handle it's very thick but very small it would be best to becloser to textbook size wasn't all that useful nice gloss pictures very thick pages small size heaviness of the pages make this book difficult to navigate cannot hold the book open flat without breaking the spine sorry not truly like a bible which will lay flat and open if you break the spine to keep pages open flat the thick pages may become unglued from the spine and negate the integrity of the binding navigation in the books are difficult if you cannot open the book flat not good for me as a reference tool much smaller than i expected love the lay out but i need glasses to read it nice book and informative i liked this book but i hated how small the print is if you have eye problems good information but there any many stones not listed a lot of great information but does not even list the basic crystals like amathest which is disappointing i was very disappointed in the book the descriptions were okay but there were no pictures at all i was looking to identify crystals so i could learn to recognize them this book is pretty much useless for that and it was the paper copy so don't think that ordering a physical copy is going to make this better for you skip it i originally rates this book a star however once you read it you realize how un useful it is for one it's limited i get that you need all books for a complete collection but it is very basic secondly you can barely identify crystals using this book i notice the pictures are very limited it would be nice if it was different pictures for the different forms and looks the crystals can come in its decent for a directory but you're gonna need something else present for my brother not exactly what he thought it would be the set up in this book is not so good it is hard to maneuver and find details on particular rocks very small book great book but came with tons of writing in it pretty outdated many of my favorite stones are absent bent pages disappointing not as complete as the soft cover book good for a quick reference if you can't find your book good but not great a big disappointment a bunch of crystals in my collection are not even in here so comprehensive it is not i really hate having to shuffle through several books to get one answer so this is frustrating also not all crystals are pictured either so not all crystals are included and of the ones that are not all of them are pictured so you decide its mediocre at best not because the author is uneducated on the topic but rather because they are incomplete its a wonderful source for stones however i didn't expect the book to be so small though its only by its thick with very small print put on you specks to read this i tried and found it difficult anyway this is not a crystal bible because petrified wood nor pyrite was not listed yet amber was the only stones i wanted to read about was not even in listed in this book i was so disappointed that i just gave this book away this morning i'm new to crystals but have a small collection of about none of them are in this book it's super rare crystals very few people have cute book in size and cover drew me in but wish i hadn't bought it good if you are an expert crystal person but otherwise no it is a book about bs and not natural science there could be pitcures of each crystal to help in identifying disappointed seems more like a religious gift then a book about precious stones it was almost creepy and cult like i wasn't expecting that should have done more research i wish i had realized that there is one other review here for the kindle version and it clearly states there are no pictures if i had realized that i probably wouldn't have purchased this at all it will be useful for looking up attributes of different stones crystals but that's it i'll have to go elsewhere for any help identifying stones not at all what i was expecting very little about the stones themselves disappointed this review is for the kindle edition only the kindle edition does not have pictures which makes it hard to identify stones its okay i expected a much larger book not a small inch book very hard to look up anything type is so small i can barly read it i was sure i ordered a inch bok but got a same one the size of my hand there are none of the crystals that i currently have in the book simple stones like amethyst green apatite and labrdorite aren't in there in i wrote you judy and your publisher about your copyright infringement in the crystal bible of my books crystal healing and the crystalline transmission legal documentation listed the many places where you have illegally taken information directly from my books and in many cases distorted the meaning definition and use of master crystals i did not hear back from you my books have been in print and fully copyrighted in many languages since got any integrity at all this womans book is plagiarized she took her information from katrina raphaell whom is the person you should trust in regards to crystals shame on you judy for stealing information soooo i requested this book thinking it was a science book on crystals and gems it's not it's some mystical voodoo witchcraft crystal healing book i mean it references crystals talking to you oooookaaaaaaay i know this book is usually recommended in the crystal groups but it just didn't meet my expectations maybe i was expecting too much i was hoping to have a book that would help me identify crystals and learn more about my crystals the book is not as comprehensive as i would have hoped there are quite a few of my stone crystals that are not in this book also the book only shows one picture of most of the crystals a crystal tumbled versus raw can look different i don't feel like the pictures shown are very good representations of the crystals the information is good for what stones they do cover however i find myself just googling my stones or searching for stones that way i really wanted to like this book but i just don't i like it just enough to not return it but if i were to do it all over again i would have purchased this book http amzn com i wanted a gem hunting field guide this isnt what i thought it was its a positive energy negative energy holostic medicine thing just know what you're buying good book i suppose if that's what you're looking for i bought this book without really looking into it i relied on the reviews of the masses to make my decision i have an education in natural science and have a hard time accepting the claims expressed in this book without any references or observable data i have found through my own research and intuition that crystals rocks gems definitely have an influence on there local environment the author has done nothing to offer the reader any insight into how these crystals effect the body and why this is a perfect example of why this science is still viewed as a pseudoscience at best or even quackery where is the proof for interested parties in the science of crystals rocks gems i have been enjoying the book rock and gem by bonewitz this is an awesome book very comprehensive and completely absent from the carefree statements that plaque this legitimate science however there is an obvious gap between the crystals structure and composition and effect on the persons near it what is stopping me from writing a book like this how would the reader know if what i write is credible the book itself is great exactly what i thought it would be the issue is the shape the book is in it looks like someone used it as a clip board all dented on the cover and green ink scribbles i originally ordered this as a gift but it looks like i'll be keeping it for myself sigh way too many factual errors for me to take this seriously i realize this isn't a scientific text but how can i trust the validity of the metaphysical properties of these stones that are detailed in this book when they can't even get the physical facts right amazonite is not opalescent amber is certainly not opaque obviously the author doesn't even know what these words mean also it pissed me off that all of the pictures of citrine were actually heat treated amethyst which i'm sure just further causes confusion for people on that matter this was a waste of time and money i'm definitely returning it dear judy hall there is no ruby in all of your books why i wrote a review for number three and number two is much the same who will stand up and tell these so called experts that they haven't scratched the surface yet when it comes to understanding the uses of these powerful natural wonders every gem and crystal dealer blindly follows these biblical meanings for minerals and crystals as a result original thinking on the subject is limited another superficial skim of many amazing rocks gemstones and crystals written with that typical new age unconcern for truth or knowledge of minerals if you read this as light relief it can be amusing don't expect to be enlightened i've been collecting crystals for years now i used to visit a metaphysical shop where the owner would use this book as a reference and kindly explain the properties of each crystal i'd purchased to me i finally purchased the book and am glad i did i initially started collecting crystals simply because i find them so lovely but the more i collect the more i become fascinated by their metaphysical properties this guidebook is a great go to reference that i find myself consulting frequently why only three stars there are two additional volumes referencing crystals not mentioned in the book i'm definitely interested in having all three volumes but the price just isn't within reach for me also one book is definitely more practical than three it would be so much easier affordable and appeasing to the crystal aficionado to combine all three volumes into one i really like this book but it's frustrating to know that i can only find part on my collection in this volume i thought this would be a compilation of all the stones on the first two editions but this is only new and rare ones which contradicts some of what heaven and earths crystals say they are for dont buy get book of stones instead the pictures are nice the book is only about healing i wanted an encyclopedia type book not impressed i was so excited to get this for my sister in law for christmas i was so excited when it came i thought it was perfect until i took the book out of the box and half of it had some sort of liquid was spilled on it completely ruining the book i can't even open the pages they're stuck together and there was no receipt in the box and no way to contact the seller highly disappointed very tiny easy read but i just thought it would have a whole lot more information i love this book but i wish there was a better way to tell what stones you have already if you don't know what they are maybe like a picture chart that you can scan to find your stone i have so many stones but wasn't able to pinpoint which they are it is really informative if you are ordering or purchasing stones though helps you with your decision making not what i was looking for doesn't show stones when they are polished if you are a beginner not the book you want these are the newer crystals not even the dealers at the rock show knew of many in the book meh the newest additions are so are that you'd have to find them at a mineral show only type print in book is a light gray hard to review material is good though if you need readers even then it is difficult disappointed in print but loved the book nice book but does not have info of many good stones was hoping for more stones to be covered in book does not even begin to help me with collection of stones i own here oh well will have to buy another book wish someone would write a book like love is in the earth a kaleidoscope of crystals by melody with pictures for me that would be the perfect book this book is super neat but i find more often than not the pictures of the crystals are not accurate to how they crystals look in real life for example color shape description of various colors a lot of it seems to be incorrect the subject matter has nothing to do with the science of the elements no healing and healing power of rocks is not science i have a bs in english and i'm a s t o u n d e d by the quality of writing presented in this book not to mention the cringe worthy redundancy of information found in each entry it's too bad judy didn't have someone review this text as a draft and then re write it in a way that is not distracting to the reader it's hard to read one sentence without getting hung up on a mistake you'd rather edit and then you find yourself asking what did i just read oh something i read a minute ago but with two words changed anyway you get the point anyone could have written this as an alternative i would suggest http www amazon com gp product psc redirect true ref oh aui detailpage o s crystal power crystal healing by michael gienger to compare the two the crystal bible is an elementary text while crystal power crystal healing employees a more concrete scientific and frankly well written approach to crystals i own both and highly recommend the latter after a year anticipating the purchase of this book i am sadly and significantly disappointed i was hoping to get a real handle for identification of my stones so disappointed that i didn't see hardly any of my common stones this is a book for more advanced crystal collections i maybe found one or two crystals that i had the rest are so rare but all in all its a good reference this book is very informative and has more about crystals that i could ever think to learn but as a beginner witch i am a bit disappointed as i thought there would be extensive information on the magickal properties of the crystals there are brief references but this book is mainly for chakra and crystal healing i expected that with an additional crystals the second volume would be even better than the first i was wrong i was not expecting stones to be dropped from the list the first two stones i looked up amazonite and rainbow obsidian were not there as a matter of fact no obsidian at all i should have peeked inside the book first before buying that was my mistake i'll be getting a copy of the original volume there is already enough crystal information in her first book this edition would appeal to more sophisticated collectors it is good however i recommend starting with of her series if you are new to stone crystal work not too bad wasn't what i was expecting for descriptive detail of each individual crystal however it's another person's interperatation of what info is relavent i like it the first two volumes were wonderful this one not so much i've been wanting this book for a while it's a decent book but it's lacking a lot of stones i'll have to get vol in hopes that i can have a complete collection the book came in time and good shape very slow service i like this book but i don't love it pros beautiful images great descriptions of healing properties and a fantastic reference for how to heal with crystals cons there are discrepancies between the can be found in blank countries section and information i have found online also there aren't pictures of the raw and tumbled polished version for every stone when trying to id crystals these photos are crucial and i find myself searching for photos online when the book doesn't provide them book is interesting but you need to buy to cover all crystals i would love this book if it weren't in microscopic print whose idea was it to print this in microprint want to save trees put it in a kindle there is a lot of info in this book which is why i bought it but my friend has it too her pictures are all too green and mine are all too red when talking about gemstones a more accurate picture is needed boohoo to the publisher for that but like i said the info is great it is actually too small the print is tiny and so are the pictures the entire original book was shrunk to fit the x or so dimensions of the book too difficult for me to read so i had to order larger books with larger print and photos i'm so very sorry i was really looking forward to receiving this book but as a life long rock hound and crystal healing instructor i can only give it two stars this might hopefully bring to someone's attention the fact that the color register on some of the plates is so far off i can't even recognize the stone ruby in zoisite image on p i've never seen zoisite that was that color even the lowest quality stones and the 'ruby' is a peculiar shade of orange red generally it's pinkish purple sugilite page umber brown image of a stone that's so vividly purple it makes your eyeballs drool p the picture of 'blue' fluorite is olive green and red rhodonite p looks red orange like dyed howlite page orange rhodochrosite hmm never seen bright orange rhodochrosite it's interesting but if i was a beginner trying to use this book as a reference i'd be way messed up pietersite doesn't do the glorious chatoyance of that stone justice seriously page malachite with chrysocolla one of the most vividly green and blue stones around and the image is black and brown yet on p it's bright green huh azeztulie p colorless or white below the image of a honey gold stone geez page the description for 'nebula stone' says black with green spots which is correct the image black with brown spots wth larimar p ewwww okay i've seen stones that color low grade greenish blue stones but d'wanna see larimar come on over i'll show you the blazing neon sky blue of a nice piece of larimar it would have been nice to see the range of colors in a stone like that since the color directly impacts what you'll pay for the stone and yet difficult images to capture like the rainbow obsidian image on p they got perfectly i'm shaking my head in bewilderment but you can't see me secondly although for the most part the information in this book is good and concise some of the info is a little misleading again take larimar rarity is listed as easily obtained and yet it's one of the most expensive stones around and there's only one place in the world where it's found it's flooded the market now but in ten years it's going to be like buying hen's teeth i really really hope that the color issues didn't occur in every print run of this book it would be a nice reference if the images were true to life while it may be somewhat more organized according to someone's view i find it very frustrating that some crystals just aren't there pyrite chalcopyrite they're just standard crystals why shouldn't they be included so basically just leave it on the shelf ordered more of melody's update books the book was in worse condition than expected it was basically taped back together you have to start this collection form bible it did not include the primary crystals so it is not bible with more crystals it includes totally different crystals had good info but unfortunately the way amazon marketed it wasn't accurate there are several versions to this bible you must purchase to get all the crystal info you need i tossed it this is a nice book for beginners the pictures are clear of the featured crystals and minerals but the descriptions for some are very general most of the information found in here can be found for free online i would purchase a more in depth book if you are looking for a more informative text regarding metaphysical uses and properties of the crystals and minerals book is ok the pictures leave something to be desired starting out you need a lot of visual aid this book does not do that i thought this had a cumulative amount of crystals from the first two books of the large amount of crystals i recently purchased only three were included in this book i recommend it but there are better books on the subject the pictures are good though but the text is so so i own a jewelry making business at the suggestion of a customer i bought this book if i took it seriously this would be one of the most bizarre and disturbing books i have ever read i can guarantee that the book will generate negative energy you will be upset that you wasted money on this total whack job of a book the author is entitled to express personal opinions but the book goes far beyond that it is filled with statements about the curative properties of the different specific gemstones there is nothing in the history of medical research which support these statements this book should not be purchased by the naive or gullible i bought this thinking it was the 'latest and greatest' version of the crystal bible but it turns out that most crystals are not listed in this book it is just a continuation of the series meaning you must buy all books giving star because this should have been noted in the listing okay little book i'm just learning about stones the info is good but wish it contained more the pictures are good some of them i couldn't make out what stones they were good info overall though this is my first purchase to learn about crystals and it isn't what i was expecting i don't think its a good starting point do not buy this if you are a novice this is for the well verse gem collector good purchase but could give more information you sent me the wrong book you sent me healing crystals instead i would like to have the crystal bible thats what i purchased email on how i can return the book you sent me and get the book i wanted thank you i am not someone who is in to crystals yet for the most part this book was very informative if you want nice color photos of different gemstone materials information about where it is found and so on however the author's use of language when it comes to the reputed medicinal benefits of the crystals was somewhat disturbing to me she makes statements about the therapeutic values of everything in the book not to appear disrespectful but it is one thing to write this crystal has traditionally been reputed to do the following and to write this crystal takes care of the following medical problems i respect the author's personal beliefs but as far as i know she has no background in the field of medicine it made me very uncomfortable that she is directly prescribing specific crystals for specific medical conditions i felt it was dangerously irresponsible i am somewhat of a crystal beginner so perhaps that is the reason why i can not truly appreciate this book i have a lot of crystals yet i could not find many of them in this book there are tons of crystals in this book but many of the pics are in raw form not polished also many of the crystals are hard to tell apart from ones on other pages the product came to me in average to good condition but it took approximately three weeks to get it and it ended up costing as much as if i had bought the book at barnes 'n noble i heard good things about judy hall's books and that's why i decided to purchase this one and besides this one is called a bible i thought it would include more information they don't go into detail on which crystals can and can't be cleansed in salt water the meditation section was a page and a half if that next time i'll just take the time to do the research online as i've found the same if not more information via internet not satisfied they probably made more than one version of the crystal bible i have seen another version probably made before the one that i got and it was better in this one i miss some stone it's a very nice book however there are many stones that i would have liked to look up but were not even listed i am going back to a time years ago when i was involved with crystals and their metaphysical properties this could help a bit in identification which was one of the reasons i bought it i have the old classics by melodie raphael and dowe and think they are superior i'm new to learning about crystals and their meanings i had seen this book in metaphysical shops and after seeing the price on here i made the purchase it's a pretty good book for beginners i think but after looking in it i have to keep in mind that there is a lot of 'fluff' and parts that really don't resonate with me personally the photos are gorgeous in here i'm not sure i would purchase this again i wish i had done more homework about this book before buying it missing a lot of gemstones and definitions aren't that great it's an okay book for beginners but will quickly grow out of it if you are looking for indepth information this is not the one cute small little book but there was a tear going through the cover and a few of the pages and the binder was all scratched i couldn't return it because it was a gift disappointing because the book itself seems interesting if you want to know about crystal healing read the books of katrina raphaell and michael gienger when you read this books and the book of melody you will see that the author simply put all the information of this three authors in her book its amazing how que can find in this text the same exactly words of crystal power crystal healing love is in the earth and crystal enlightenment buy the originals the crystal bilble has great info on many crystals that i'd never even heard of sadly however i had mistakenly thought that this was a more complete version of the crystal bible and would just contain more stones and crystals in fact it does not include the common stones that i assume were covered in the first volume such as amethyst and rose quartz while i'd recommend this book for anyone who's looking to expand their knowledge of stones and crystals for anyone who's a beginner or bought this book to help teach beginners i'd say look elsewhere this is a great book however i was a little disappointed because it is missing some of the stones i wanted to learn about that are actually in the first book this is a good book but i would recommend having the first one as well if you own the crystal bible this makes a great companion to it even if the stones are quite a bit more obscure rare and expensive in comparison to the first i find it nice to have just in case and to keep myself educated and also just for fun it still gives the same great amount of information as the first one with fantastic pictures as well this book is for believers only not in any way a science text there are factual errors there are no clues how the author comes up with healing properties no studies methodology or evidence of research the author does not give an adequate explanation of who she is where this knowledge comes from education anything i was wondering if this book was defective missing a chapter on research bibliography or anything that could breathe life in to so many unfounded statements apparently not some will believe anything it's an intelligence test ok i don't believe one iota in the healing powers of crystals so this book was definitely not for me but i use it to sell the jewelry we make to prove to the idiots who do believe that they will be cured of whatever ails them if the buy the right jewelry with the right crystal here is an example of one item in the book excuse the spelling azezutlite a crystal with incredible powers it is the biggest ripoff in the crystal buying world i e selling at incredible prices when in reality it is only plain old quartz but it is listed in this book anyway you know why i bought it this volume is as thorough and beautiful as volume but feel this will not be as useful to me as the previous one which contained all the crystals i need to be acquainted with as a beginner i can see volume helping the more advanced student but i do love that i have the set i am usually a fan of judy hall's books they are a good reference even though at times they can be a bit too new agey for my liking the information is usually correct but i noticed with this book there are several bits of information that is incorrect examples blue moonstone is only found in russia this is incorrect sri lanka is one of the finest producers of this stone paraiba tourmaline comes from brazil nigeria and mozambique paraiba tourmaline only comes from paraiba brazil everything else is just tourmaline herkimer diamonds come from new york himalayas and china same with the paraibas herkimer diamonds only come from herkimer new york anything else is a double terminated quartz it is mainly little things like locations that are incorrect but since this is a book that people are turning to for information it should be correct and properly researched this was the only problem i had with this book the photos layout and other features i found useful a nice supplement to the crystal bible which was one of my first crystal mineral books and is still one of my favorites however i'm not as complete of a fan of crystal bible as i am of the original some and i'm saying only some of the info seems quite hastily put together and in my opinion isn't a complete description of the attributes of that particualr crystal or mineral there's one in there that i don't agree with at all from my personal work with that mineral but i choose not to mention which one that is in this forum i've also noticed a couple of unusual spellings for names of a particular crystal or mineral one thing in particular i'd like to point out septarian is a combination of calcite bentonite and aragonite not calcite aragonite and chalcedony but i suppose that could depend on who you ask my gut still says the first combination of minerals is correct now that i've aired my concerns a bit i will say that i'm not unhappy with this book perhaps my personal knowledge and skills have just developed beyond the point of being able to accept everything said by judy as complete and accurate i think it's a good reference tool but i would not use as my only reference tool i'm not sorry i purchased this book would do so again and have already recommended it to others althought it has nice pictures and very nice info there are many stones listed that are not found easily i recommend the first volume if you are new to stones and their properties i will continue to study all the stones listed anyway although judy hall's books don't generally do it for me i do recommend both volumes of the crystal bible in fact bypass all her other recent works for these two it will be more complete than juggling three or four volumes this book is like many of her others with listings of hundreds of stones and their many different forms the entries are a little bit more simplified than in the first volume and there is no easy summary of the properties of any stone the strength of this work is that it is arranged alphabetically rather than by colour wherein several of her others are less user friendly for the opposite reason there are still some misnomers and photographs that are not exactly representative of the crystal being defined as well as a seemingly missing understanding of the mineralogical properties of the specimens being described some of the entries appear to be inconsistent and incongruent with those around them this is possibly an error in publishing and a second printing or edition may have these errata corrected this volume contains more than two hundred stones not mentioned in volume one to my knowledge there are no repeats from said volume the book covers a lot of formations and findings that are very recent and otherwise unpublished about several stones have their trade names used which do not reflect the mineral being described and others are merely tyographically incorrect i e brandenberg where brandberg should be used with some simple and effective introductory chapters regarding the history and lore of the mineral kingdom and new age crystal topics such as grids new areas of mining and stones with high frequencies you'll find that this book is a nice companion to any crystal library maybe hall calls it a bible because you have to surrender your reason and have faith in her to get the vision hall produced a beautiful little book seductively laid out in the best way possible easy to use logical in format and gracious on the eyes the subject matter is fascinating as humans evolve it's becoming obvious to more and more people that there is a plane superior to the material plane on which energy is transformed gemstones have a unique signature in this way and they can employed to the benefit of humankind the flaw the deep fatal and overwhelming flaw in the book is not just the lack of evidence for the qualities assigned to each gem but the plain contempt demonstrated to any rational person that this is even an issue i am professional involved in many new age activities and i never cease to be appalled and amused at the bottomless gullibility of the consumer i am not accusing her of holding gemstones in her hands and writing down how groovy it makes her feel in what direction but if there is a legitimate methodology involved in her enterprise then it ought to be noted the only other possibilities are there is no legit methodology and the basis of what she does is nonsense based on faith in her intuition so she can't put it forth or she does have a legit method here but you just have faith little one don't worry your head about such things just leave it to us high spirit gurus hall mentions the traditions of chinese medicine and ayurveda in passing but that's a very tiny part of the input here the greater bulk of this book is pure new age speculation i hope i'm wrong because if it's all correct stuff here the book is invaluable but there is no reason to believe that the info is real outside of one's faith in her bible i purchased this book the same time i purchased the book of stones it has been a great guide to help with things that are not in the the other book it is good when used in conjunction with the book of stones alone this book doesn't have the same impact as if used together but it is a great little guide when you can't keep the bigger book around i give this book thumb up ok well the book is pretty and all but it is monotone in the fact that it mainly focuses in stuff such as healing sicknesses and chakras it's doesn't tell u much about the magickal properties such as protection and luck everything was pretty science ish souding as she was a doctor if you are into healing i highly recommened it but if you are like me and want some magick info get something else having experience with melody's crystal healing and her book love is in the earth i have found that this book is ok for people beginning to work with crystals and stones but that it has a lot of misinformation for example carnelian does not cleanse other stones only selenite can do that don't rely totally on the information in this book if you want the definitve go to melody this book is really helpful for you if you already know what crystals you have in your collection or if you just want to know the corresponding chakras or different uses however i bought this to help me identify a huge bag of crystals i bought and it fell short the images are pretty hard to see there should be more images of the different variations an agate can come in for example it should have its original form colored form tumbled form etc the index is pretty hard to use and not idiot proof they fail to mention some major crystals that are out there and are just as important as a snowflake obsidian for example if you know what you have this book is very helpful but if you're not an expert probably not the cheapest and not the easiest book to get this is a picture book of rocks and gems but not all rocks and gems i have not found one that big and complete you'll have to do as i have done buy several books for your rocks and gems reference library you should have this one in your reference library it is as it is titled a book specifically dealing with rocks and gems known as crystals if your curiosity gets the better of you buy it it'll answer some of your questions but not all of them that's the reason for the other books i had high hopes for the book as it proclaimed itself the crystal bible one expects some accuracy with such a proclamation however i was a bit disconcerted when i got to the section on chrysoberyl where i read that it is a form of beryl that is simply not true beryl is beryllium aluminum silicate that forms in the hexagonal crystal structure chrysoberyl is an oxide that forms in the orthorhombic crystal structure they are different minerals and different crystals also i think it should have been mentioned that some of the new crystals are really new marketing names for minerals that have long been known and actually have little value azeztulite is simply opaque white quartz angelite is simply blue anhydrite i can take no issue with the uses and attributes ascribed to the crystals because the author states on the last page that her knowledge of the crystals is mostly intuitive and is based on years of experience that much experience must have led her to a great understanding of the crystals and their powers i also found the photos to be excellent allowing the book to serve as a great visual reference i would hope that the next edition would have some of the factual information reviewed and corrected this would make the book much more valuable as a reference this is a useful book for people who want a standard introductory guide to some mostly common crystals and stones for new age uses and crystal healing each stone has a page with a picture and brief standard description of attributes and information about use for healing there is a very tiny section in the back about the aura chakras and methods of crystal healing this incudes a bit about use of gem remedies grids and laying on of stones but is way too short this is a book of crystal properties rather than instrutions on applications there is not much here about magic kal uses but much could be deduced the information is assembled from many other sources and is the same as you find in almost every other crystal book the book is useful if not exciting or really connected with the evolving energy of the crystals it presents crystals more as objects and tools rather than as living spirits and partners or connectors with spiritual and healing energies and intellegence there is nothing particularly original in this book but it is well done if limited it coulds be a useful reference and is small enough to carry with you when you shop i'm going to be the one grouch i bought this book while i was on vacation this week and desperate for something to read and i'm sorry i spent the on it not only have i always loved and collected stones i have an earth science degree specializing in mineralology crystalography and paleontology i have a very extensive library on stones ranging from the complicated reference tomes to magical properties i didn't care for the statements without explanations or the failure to include alternate names and many of the properties just didn't jive with my personal experiences or what's known that's no big deal each person can have a different experience with or reaction to a stone what really turned me off from the book were the blatant errors in fact just one mistake out of many was the statement that star sapphires have five points the star in a sapphire or other stones is caused by very fine inclusions of fibers or needles crossing asterism and the points only occur in even numbers there were numerous technical errors similar to that which make me think it wasn't just a typo the only decent thing about the book was some of the pictures but you can get that in any good mineralology reference book and those sometimes have good folklore info also i can't give even the pictures a full thumbs up because i'm suspicious of a few there are much better books out there i was not impressed stuff sticks to them very easily and even when you get it as clean as you can it seems to hold stains strange stars because i heat the it put oil and make sure the oil is heated before putting food to fry and still the appearance of the pan after washing it up is awful therey like white spots even after following the instructions for washing this cookware is lovely however it takes a very long time to heat and is the hardest to clean of any cookware we ve ever owned that includes higher quality and lower quality cookware we ve owned i m disabled and live with moderate to severe chronic pain depending upon the particular day but still do as much as i m physically able and still wanted to take good care of our newest set of cookware so i ve been very careful to follow the instructions and even to educate the rest of the family on its use and care well after a little over a month of use and care we ve reached the point where i can t stand for anyone to use this cookware because i m the one who usually has to clean it i have the most time and can t stand for dirty dishes to clutter the sinks and counters today i had to clean scrambled eggs from the same pan twice and i m physically in awful shape tonight terrible pain it doesn t seem to matter how closely we follow the manufacturer s instructions how much we grease a pan ahead of time etc everything sticks to these pans very badly and is nearly impossible to remove and no we don t burn our food i wish to goodness we d tried some other cookware it s now too late to return this oh and if you purchase this cookware whatever you do don t try to wash it in the dishwasher even though they say it s fine to even if you scrub it ahead of time anything left in the pans will practically be sealed onto the surface i bought this stainless roaster because of the great reviews here on amazon it came as promised and when i opened it was beautiful and shiny the next day i was having company and i prepared a standing rib roast it called for a cooking temp of degrees for minutes and then shut off the oven for two hours and don't open the door after the two hour cook time with the oven off i pull out a gorgeous prime rib cooked perfectly and delicious the pan however had turned a copper color and when i washed and cleaned it the stainless had flaked off the aluminum in the bottom of the pan there was no cleaning the pan back to anything that looked like silver or clean the rack which got the low scores on the review did however come through beautifully and cleaned up like brand new for the investment i would rather have put another few bucks on it and got one that could handle more than one roast before looking years old and like it had been used over a camp fire since the rack will most likely be employed with each roasting i guess the stainless flaking off the aluminum core wont hurt anything but it still sucks that you pay good money for a quality name like cuisinart and come out with a total turd like this unless you are roasting a couple of cornish hens or slow roasting at low temps stay away from this junk my moms year old blue speckled roaster is still the best one i own i seem to be having the same problem as many other people who have glass stove tops i've only used it a couple times and have been careful to preheat it slowly and to not run it under cold water while it's still hot but it still warped now it wobbles on my stove top beautiful set but two pans already warped we followed directions around using lower heat always having something in the pans and cleaning afterwards still both pots warped after first use i have not yet done a warranty claim but it was certainly disappointing i bought one it was warped i returned it and bought another it also was warped they lie do not buy this unless you like to scrub the supposedly non stick griddle stuff sticks and you cant use steel wool so it is really hard to clean this item sucks and i used it so i can't return it again there is nothing non stick about this surface they lie and they just want to fool you with their claims i extensively researched the best cookware set to use with a ceramic top stove this set was top rated on several reviews however each time we've used it our food sticks to the bottom and gets scorched despite following low heat settings and soluble non spray fat instructions my spouse actually went out and bought a cheap non stick pan to cook his eggs on the weekends this set is terrible i used the large skillet once and it's almost as if the coating has worn off and now it's this horrible white residue see photo that won't come off even worse i contacted cuisinart and they gave me an email address to send my complaint to and it's been over two weeks and i haven't heard anything back it's one thing to have a terrible product but the customer service is even worse and i will never buy any of their products ever again got it just today and was really excited to use but just after single use pan looks like this see photo and i have rubbed hardly but still with some stain or something and when you touch it's so smooth is it normal for stainless steel it's my first time using this kind of stuff confused and disappointed nonstick coating started to peel on edges within month of use i contacted cuisinart and was given a service number it has been over month and they have not responded currently their service phone has also been under maintenance making it difficult to any further resolution this was a big purchase and i babied this pan for the first few meals it still warped in the middle just stunned a pan this heavy would warp and my gas stove has metal plates that create a flat surface for small pans which also evens out the heat and it still warped like a grocery store pan i do not like the rivets there has to be a better way to attach handles than a technic that was used in the bronze age it traps food and makes it a task every time i clean it just hate it and regret the purchase i have the multiclad pro cookware set and bought this pan separately this one is the only one that doesn't sit flat on the stove otherwise i like it would be perfect but it bows slightly on the bottom when heated which causes the whole thing to spin easily i have a glass cooktop so a coil or gas setup may not have this issue everything sticks and ends up always burning not happy at all with how much the set is compared to how it cooks i love all the sizes and that the kids fit everything only reason i m giving it a star rating these pans while seemingly heavy and well built cannot seem to avoid warping on my radiant electric cooktop i have never exceeded the middle setting on my burners and i never put cold water on a pan without allowing it to gradually air cool after the first pan was so warped after two cooking session that i had to rock it back and forth on the stovetop for it to heat both hemispheres i ordered a replacement and specifically laid out the replacement on my stovetop to verify that it lay flat and did not spin i then cooked two slices of bacon allowing the pan to preheat on medium and then reducing the heat as soon as the heat got up to medium temperatures the pan spun easily and rocked back and forth on the stovetop after allowing it to cool and cleaning it with warm water it is now permanently unstable on a flat surface so even armed with the knowledge that warping is a potential issue and carefully adhering to cuisinart s suggestions to avoid said warping i am still left with an unstable pan avoid this product if you have an electric range i bought two of these both warped on med heat in the first couple uses i will be doing a second return and looking elsewhere probably all clad though i was hoping that these would work out so i could save some money i also have the piece set and the saute pan has started to warp as well these pans are a pain to clean i give up after just over a year the non stick coating is coming off in two places around the rim good sauce pan don't even think about egss its beautiful but after literally washing and drying it by hand one time it tarnished the next few times i used them every thing stuck to the bottom i didn't expect it to be non stick but i also didn't expect to use times more oil to prevent sticking i ended up purchasing a wok style pan and use it for everything without a hitch it was less than including tax this set was such a waste of money the construction of the pan feels solid and the handle nice to hold i bought this because the much lower cost competitor to all clad unfortunately the pan wobbles when i place it on my induction cooker the wobbling was a known issue reading through the rest of the reviews i was just hoping i wouldn't have it right out the gate i emailed cuisinart and they responded right away saying that a wobble or curvature to the bottom of the pan is not normal and that i can get it exchanged as part of their warranty program i don't believe i should have to pay to have a new pan replaced since i'm returning the pan i can't say how well it works so it gets one star once i receive a new pan i will update my review one more chance cuisinart please don't blow it i had these for one year and a few months they are rusting i called cuisinart customer service and was lectured on how rust forms and how it isn't covered under warranty i have taken many chemistry courses and know how rust forms it should not be forming at least no where near this fast on true stainless steel i love to cook and treat my cooking items with great care so it definitely was not misuse stay away from these pans i include one picture from one of my lids they will not honor the warranty or provide a replacement or refund the overall finish of the pan and quality seemed to be pretty good straight out of the box on one of its first uses we attempted to cook some tortillas in the pan this requires high heat and this single use caused the bottom of the pan to warp which has led to very uneven cooking on our glass cooktop since only the one side center of pan over to the handle actually touches the heating element i really want to like this pan it feels heavy it cleans nicely it is a great size i love that the lid that came with the deep saute can be used on this pan as well but a frying pan needs to be able to handle the heat required for saute without warping terrible design the steps on the bottom are only a half inch deep and does not want to stay in any size pot especially ones with a flared lip just putting the lid on it makes it fall out of the pot very thin metal not tri ply the one with two handles might be better balanced and actually stay on the pot i do not recommend this one going into this purchase i knew that this was more expensive than the regular cookware while i knew not to expect it to be significantly better than the other stuff i have tried over time i did expect it to be at least dishwasher safe in the short run i just pulled out the pot after first wash in the dishwasher and it is all discolored and scratched from inside definitely not dishwasher safe as it claims to be i regret this purchase and should have just gone with the cheaper stuff knowing that i wont really be able to use them in the dishwasher i want to return this but i didn't even keep the box around pan is heavy and distributes heat evenly but the non stick coating is poor the coating begins failing almost immediately it fails first on the top edge rim and peels downward into the pan bottom i have had two of these pans and they both have failed exactly the same way good luck if you buy this item can't cook on high heat or the pans will warp what's the point of spending this much on something that will look like to version in a week just tried it followed cleaning instructions it's all mottled and brown don't buy this garbage fry pans bowed at the bottom and no longer sit flat very disappointed very hard to clean i have a whole cabinet full of cuisinart multiclad pro it used to be to me as good as all clad but i bought this pan recently and within three weeks the non stick coating completely peeled away contacted warranty support at cuisinart conair now i guess and it was more bureaucratic than a federal government agency to make a warranty claim then they wanted to ship a replacement so now in order to get the pan as i bought it i'd have to pay more money if i decided to fill out all the red tape and send to two different email addresses a huge disappointment in what used to be a great american company when cuisinart mcp arrived i love them very much because they look stunning but after i used it for a while i was getting extremely disappointed because it is unable to be cleaned pls note i don't mean it is hard to clean them i mean it is impossible to clean them look at pictures i just boil several eggs with clean water every morning sometimes egg will be broken and then the stain will be attached on the saucepan can't be removed at all even i put the pan in water for whole days it still can't be removed i use zwilling before never met this issue arrived with a little wobble days later it s too warped to use one scorching hot spot that makes contact with the burner and the rest of the cooking surface floats inch above the heat the pan was flat when it arrived after or uses at low medium heat the bottom warped returned it for a replacement and the same thing happened with the next one at this point i can't return it but i can at least tell others this is the only pan i have that's done this and it's also my most expensive pan i was so excited to receive as i have the set but does not include the larger skillet after using twice on a glass top stove the pan no longer sits flat sooooo disappointed the first time i used it on a glass top electric range it warped so that only the center was in contact with the heat the concentrated heat then caused it to stain we are sending it back as a mis represented product this product is marketed as a non stick pan with helper handle in reality it's a tri ply induction ready stainless steel pan the pan itself will probably work fine but i already have an extensive collection of similarly constructed cookware i still use a couple of non stick pans and based upon the description was expecting a non stick coating sticks everything even though i'm very careful purchased the entire set of multiclad by cuisinart then added both larger skillet and braising pan stainless steel the only way to cook however as the mcp hn had warped and i did nothing to cause it all other pans are perfect and are use as much as the others no washing right after cooking even let them go overnight in most cases long story short registered all my products with cuisinart online contacted and told to email picture of warpage sent to different individuals now been almost weeks and have not received even a reply confirming email receipt called back with case number gal on phone says they have working days to reply which has also gone by either way stuck with a pan that is warped does not cook properly now lifetime warranty means absolutely nothing if they string out a replacement that takes the rest of my life to receive sad state of affairs a company is only as good as its word and cuisinarts word is not good small claims here i come once i find their registered agent and the registered agent for amazon not a fan of these pans simply boiled water with noodles and it stained the inside bottom of the pan would not come clean stuff sticks to them i sent them back after i could not flip my son's grilled cheese sandwich after few uses i ve seasoned them as instructed preheated the pan added oil and waited minutes before adding food and everything still sticks making me have to clean and resseason them every time i m extremely frustrated with these pans and wouldn t recommend them i m going to clean and season them one more time and see what happens i'd really like to find out why a manufacturer can label a saucepan as three quart when it only holds quarts there is absolutely no way to get quarts of liquid into this pan even if it wasn't necessary to stir i am so disappointed in these they looked terrible after one wash the set i received was obviously used and then returned the set seems well assembled and is very heavy it contains most of the pots and pans you would need to outfit a kitchen we were so excited to add this to our cuisinart set it was at the top of my wife's xmas list and i found a great deal on amazon after using it twice the base became distorted we have a glass cooktop and it was beautifully flat out of the box but rocked severely after the second use we have the complete set with the external aluminum rings and we know not to use high heat on those as well so we were totally surprised and disappointed i've been trying to find a skillet with the same construction as our others but it looks like they're all internal aluminum sandwiched between stainless i trust that external ring to maintain the shape so i'll keep looking everything sticks like glue other ratings have it just one notch below all clad which also sticks like glue probably throw away and buy some non stick what a waste i bought this pan specifically to cook eggs on for its small size from day one half the egg sticks to the bottom and sides i ve tried multiple non stick solutions including seasoning it with coconut oil nothing works i literally spend more time cleaning it than cooking on it i will say it s heavy and seems like a decent quality i ve only handwashed it but it claims to be dishwasher safe as long as you don t mind a completely non stick surface i really wanted to like this set that we purchased to replace year old revereware we used it for less than months hand washed and didn't cook anything exotic or strange after making beef and vegetable soup we washed and put away the stock pot the next time we got it out the bottom inside and out was covered with rust i used the scouring side of a blue kitchen sponge to remove the rust but it didn't come close to removing the discoloration i'm trying to imagine what we could have done to cause the pots to do this since most of the other reviews are positive i have to think ours came from a bad manufacturing batch they were returned i like it will open size of bottle cap and pry open cans with tabs i thought from reading it would do more than that so was disappointed while they function just as well as all clad i have noticed quickly that the finish is not the same and tat they spot and mar quickly while this does not affect the cooking or useability of the product it does dimish their appeal appeaarance horrible everything i tried to cook stuck to the pan or pot also they look horrible after the first use and you can get them clean i sent it back i dont recommend this product at all the pans were not non stick therefore you had to soak them in hot water with detergent to get the food off very unhappy just about everything sticks to the bottom of the pan you can't fry bacon or even eggs or saute vegetables the pans were a gift and are beautifully designed in stainless steal until you try to cook with them i'm very unhappy with this product got a complete set of multiclad pro pots and frypans a couple of years ago and was very impressed good cooking and no warping on my electric cooktop unfortunately i got this piece in august and after only two uses it is completely warped it spins like a top on the cooktop and makes almost no contact with the cooking surface so is worthless i used it just like i've used the other multiclad pro pieces and so hoping this is just a defective piece now i'm off to call cuisinart and see about their customer service will report back rust found under handle when first washed had to come from the factory like that as it was only here a few hours returned click image to enlarge great pans but the food sticks terribly to the frying pans ended up buying other frying pans that had a non stick coating bought two both wrapped on first use used it on a glass top stove with heat or out of i have a bunch of pans and put and i have never had anything else wrap i contacted cuisinart and wrote a polite mail for which i annoyingly had to set up an cuisinart account describing what had gone wrong and asking if i should pre treat them in any way or use them differently cuisinart never responded amazon was great and i got my money back with no questions asked unfortunately after first use inside started pitting three pinhead size pits appeared on bottom definitely defective material everything i cook in these pans burn two of them have a yellow discoloration also i bought them in september have only used them recently they re awful i need to find out how to get my money back liked the size skillet was not entirely flat on bottom when received and has only become worse with use it leans toward the long handle side and there is a th inch gap between the flat top surface of the range and the bottom of the skillet the skillet has never been used on high setting i got this because it is supposed to work well on induction cooktops i have a thermador freedom induction cooktop and this griddle doesn't heat well and won't brown pancakes on it the product arrive with many weird marks on the surface not sure what it is washed it and it s still there definitely not what you want with a stainless steel pot not one star because it is functional no leaking or anything the rivets on the stock pot are made of aluminum i made some boiled peanuts in it and now they are erroded stainless steel would not do that i don t want aluminum in my food so out this goes don t let the fancy name cuisinart fool you i ve also been disappointed in an enamel covered pot by this company the lid and the lip of the pot are chipped and rusted after years of use i am not satisfied with how hard it is to clean these pans never spent this much for cookware and i have to say i should ve stuck with cheaper seriously considering returning them buyers beware this is not stainless steel perhaps it may have been when it was first sold on amazon but now it is cladded stainless i took one look and decided that cuisinart didn't really need my money of they were going to blatantly do a bait and switch on me i bought a set a year ago and have regretted it ever since i paid more for these beautiful pans than i have any pans in my life i m in my s now and they are the worst i have ever had no matter how slow i cook in them everything sticks so frustrating i have to let them soak for awhile before you can wash them don t recommend these at all unless you are just going for looks very disappointed bought this set because it was suppose to be good for our new stove burn my hand on hot handle also don t recommend for induction stove one light touch of a metal spatula and the mirror finish is scratched and ruined the scratch then stains and spots as aluminum layer below takes over the photo shows the one slight scratch i made and what happens along the scratch line and then two spots occur on the other side of the pan where there were no scratches the pan which cuisinart assures me will last as long as i do was a birthday gift taken out of the box at the end of november since the first light scratch i have used only rubber spatulas and wood spoons i cook scrambled eggs in it each morning the bottom of the skillet bowed called customer service and they said it was misuse i had a cuisinart set for years and recently exchanged to this one that never happened to me before maybe a defective skillet at the end not happy awful do not recommend hard to clean is not nonstick i give this product stars because it looks great and cooks great everything sticks no matter what i try even bacon stuck very hard to clean very hard to clean nice and heavy pots and pans great feel and heat control i have cooked several meals on these already big negative on our induction range they make a lot of noise buzzing and vibrating never had another pan make such annoying sound seems to only be on our highest heat settings once you bring it down to only or less power it mostly subsides i assume its the metal cladding you can see the internal cladding from where the water boils video attached absolutely the most terrible pans to cook with i pride myself on my cooking abilities and i've realized that stainless comes with learning curve welp done learning pans will be tossed out after a month or so in near mint condition pots are good boil quick but whatever want to brown your hashbrowns impossible want to cook an egg or anything for that matter with healthy amounts of oil or butter or coconut oil you can't and won't you'll be stuck not being able to scrub pan because although it has half a potato from hash or half an egg from eggs or most of your pan seared shrimp stuck to the bottom you have to care for the pan as if it were a baby's bum can't use sos pad and discolorations are absolutely a pain to get off you will literally spend equal amounts of time scrubbing pans as you do cooking in them all these great reviews how in the heck i use my pans more than my pots what a crock im going back to my kohl's clearance off bargain rack non stick terrible product and surface metal rash on first use don't but it and it's really waste of money amazon wasn't helpful at all and the rude rep offered me where i have to goto post office and get a box and arrange return amazon used to be more customer focus back in the days but not anymore the pan warped and will not set level on my new cooktop i have only owned it for a few weeks additionally note that food tends to stick to stainless steel if you warm the grease to you can avoid some of the sticking but then there is a lot of popping of the oil which makes for a messy clean up first off this pan is wonderful it is attractive cooks wonderfully and was easy enough to use and clean for a full stainless pan why three stars the bottom was not flat that is a deal breaker for me so mine is going back i think it could just be a defective pan so ymmv i did have a little trouble getting the pan to give me textbook leidenfrost effect this is the process to make sure your pan is fully preheated and thus fairly non stick now non stick in a stainless pan is not non stick in the way that teflon or ceramic would be non stick things can and may stick to the pans surface but this surface is non stick in the way a well seasoned bbq grill grate is non stick when a properly preheated surface has brought protein to the proper temperature the protein will release and thus be non stick however bits of protein and fat may remain these can easily be removed with a deglazing process deglazing is what makes this pan a star you can build amazing pan sauces and gravies with this pan i cooked breakfast sausage in the pan the sausage released and cooked beautifully i found most of the cooking surface to cook and brown the sausage fairly evenly there was a small zone area near the handle that browned more slowly i assume the handle absorbed and radiated some of the heat from this area you will see the variation in my sausage picture it however left nice little bits of protein and fat for one of the nicest sausage gravies i ve made non stick plastic pans will never build a gravy like this cast iron can but is more difficult because of the darkness of the pan stainless is much more forgiving with wet cooking like pan sauce or gravy than cast iron would be making clean up a snap comparatively i tried this pan after a seasoning process with a high temp cooking oil and i tried it unseasoned i found it equally non stick either way though if you use the leidenfrost test preseasoned pans will not work well what is leidenfrost effect you ask the leidenfrost effect in this case is when a properly preheated pan will cause a drop of water to dance around the pan like a mercury ball i was somewhat successful in this test at level six cooking on my fridgidair inductive cook top my water droplet was somewhat more flat than i would expect but held together and danced a bit when i preheated my pan i gave it a few seconds on low then turned it to level for about a minute then finally up to level induction cook tops raise the temp very quickly this can warp a bonded pan so for the love of rachel ray dont set your induction cook top to high and fire this puppy up i ll restate here my pan was rounded out of the box i decided to test it out for a few days since i had it i did not warp this pan the pan is attractive enough to leave out and the lid is very helpful in preheating and melting and reducing splatter i followed all directions that came with the inch open skillet as well as online resources for keeping stainless steel as non stick as possible but the fried egg test failed every time on even extremely low slow heat simply not usable on my second one first one worked really bad it was under warranty just had to pay shipping handling on anyone second one is doing the same thing would not recommend this product does not cook or clean well everything sticks and really difficult to clean disappointed in this product as we looked into serveal options it's a high quality pan yes but it's way too heavy to do even simple things like draining out pasta or like even washing it by hand i regret buying this set very shiny very pretty very useless it takes a bit of skill to use chromed sets like these since you need to know how to cook things so they don't stick to the pan let me tell you it is not worth it months in and the discoloration is discouraging the food naturally sticks to it one way or another you need to keep a very watchful eye on your food or it will ruin the pan with burned grease almost impossible to tear off even with professional grease removal products save yourself some trouble and buy none stick sets and forget about chromed sets this product is testing every bit of my patience every time i have to cook times a day i've been happily cooking with the cuisinart mcp n cookware set on our glass cooktop for months now without problems i've bought this skillet to complement the set the pan warped after first use i took it out of the package cleaned it with mild detergent heated it up on on the glass cooktop added oil to the pan once hot enough added some chicken and then noticed that it had already warped i sent it in for a replacement did the exact same steps with the replacement only with heat and the pan had already warped after adding the oil warped pans do not work well on glass cooktops because of uneven heat distribution this looks like a design mistake to me and i expect the same thing to happen on the third pan so avoid this if you are cooking on a glass cooktop i did not encounter these problems with the saute pan or the skillet of the mcp n set very disappointing this looks like a nice set but buyer beware the qt pot that is advertised and stamped on the pan is false it is only qt think about before you buy only three stars because the bottom is tapered we have a few all clad pans have served us well for year despite abuse after using gently pasta eggs both the frying pan and the pot had spots on the interior and exterior which i could not remove i returned the set will slowly add additional all clad mc as budget allows horrible to clean bought this and within a couple of months the non stick surface started peeling away from the pan very disappointing so don't waste your time pan warped making it terrible to cook with on a glass stovetop the part that stays in contact with the heat works fantastically too bad that s only of the pan now our cuisinart mcp n multiclad pro stainless quart casserole with cover arrived september and within days it was so warped that i can no longer safely use it on my glass top range without leaving scratches caused by the wobble and movement of the pan we followed all recommended heat level and washing instructions but yet the pan warped this is very disappointing since this was an add on piece that i ordered to match our set of cuisinart multiclad pro stainless pots and pans we have had no trouble with warping from any of the pieces in out set but this item has been a huge disappointment i do not recommend that you waste your time and money on this pan very nice quality and great price but the bottom of the pan turns cloudy after cooking in it once and nothing i have tried get it back to shiny so it looks bad on our stove configuration we have to use this griddle with the handle facing us the handles get very hot my wife and i have both burned ourselves accidentally as we reached over the handle while cooking we have yet to figure out how to permanently attach a potholder i wish cuisinart would have attached a heat shield to the handles the packaging is cheap and tape everywhere ue to have static label and now you spend an hour getting the adhesive label removed and of course made in china after reading all the good reviews and considering the price i knew i would get an awesome set of cooking ware wrong everything sticks and stains the pans i am an experienced cook and i ve taken cooking temperatures and various cooking oils into consideration but no this is just a bad product those people with positive reviews might of been paid to say positive reviews do not buy everything sticks and stain these pans it sticks and gets discolored very disappointed never use it i never write reviews but i feel a certain duty here i returned this pan about two months after purchasing it due to major warping the return process went smoothly so no complaints there however the replacement pan i received has also warped i've been cooking for years and i've never once had a pan warp i babied the replacement pan because i was concerned about the issue happening again i never used it on high heat warmed it up slowly etc still it warped if you haven't had to deal with warped pans before it's a huge pain the pan spins and rocks on the stove while trying to use it meaning you constantly have to hold onto it i've had better luck in the past years with cheap pans from walmart or target i will be avoiding this brand in the future i'm also sharing a picture of a cuisinart nonstick pan whose coating just peeled off one day not happy this has been a huge waste of i hate these pots pans the handles and lids get hot they are heavy they are extremely difficult to clean b c everything sticks to them and they don't heat evenly everything i cook sticks to the pan even when sprayed with non stick this leaves me scrubbing to get the food off of them i feel like the description of this item is completely inaccurate i wish we had returned them when we could have b c it's just a big waste of money wife is very pleased with this product this skillet worked fine for the first couple times then it warped it does not set level the heat does not distribute and i am very disappointed i was expecting much better for the price works on induction but heating is not even e g middle of a piece of bacon cooks and ends still chewy and raw beware used twice look terrible and discolored my stove top do not buy i am very disappointed the set looked nice but after the first use they all look stained this set is clearly deffective not worth it too much money for cookware that are heavy and become ugly in less than a week of usage love the pan worked great for the first times on glass top by the rd usage it was severly warped and rocked back and forth every time i touch it i havn't turned the heat up on the stove past out of saucepan disappointing after first and second use white spots developed at the base of the pan these spots would not scrub out also lacks a helper handle which would be very helpful when the pan is full of water used the saut pan once tried cleaning it and after minutes gave up yes used bartenders friend tried everything else in my arsenal to no avail returned the set and lost thanks to the pleasures of using amazon but that is another story i would absolutely not recommend this worst pan i ever baught sticks like crazy and it's really freaking hard to clean i have to use a large amount of oil or butter in order for my food not to stick especially eggs these pans look nice and seem like great quality but it's frustrating to cook when everything sticks to the pans my pan lasted about months and then the non stick coating started peeling from the pan the lifetime warranty on the pan is not what it appears to be because cuisinart will not replace a plan where the coating is separating from the pan unless the pan is relatively new do not buy this pan for the lifetime warranty because you will pay to ship the pan to cuisinart and then find out that the non stick coating was compromised by customer misuse and you will be out the cost of shipping the pan to cuisinart beautiful set but cleaning them is an impossible task no following the instructions they provide soak it in hot water with soap is not enough i regret not buying a non stick set i just bought thus guess what i think they pay people to review it and to decive others this is it close to what i sa in the reviews and all of those comments i really regret of speanding almost dollars for this crap please don't waist you money look for you self of my pic this is after i use it one time my wife was super excited to buy these to replace our emeril non sticks because they looked worn to her i thought they were fine but didn't argue with these stainless pans cooking is a misery everything sticks like crazy they are simply horrible try sauteeing some potatoes or doing eggs they'll come apart because no matter what temp no matter how much oil you use these pans stick to the food other foods stick as well and this isn't just a clean up issue if i'm browning food i want the brown on the food not on the pan how that's acceptable to anyone is beyond me there are reviewers here giving these things stars and saying just get a different pan for any browning frying use huh so spend on a set that's only good for boiling water or doing sauces and buy another for real use give me a break these pans are a scam i'd give them zero stars if i could misleading description of being nonstick returned the product and purchased different brand do not buy i have had to have the two large skillets replaced once already because they warped so bad they could not sit flat on the stove top while i appreciate cuisinart replacing them at no cost the replacement skillet that i got warped the first time it was brought up to heat it was brand new out of the box and not warped at all but when exposed to medium heat and brought up to temperature it warped again it really is a shame because this is beautiful cookware but the quality leaves something to be desired nice to look at good size and shape nice handles and yes it does work with induction but even heating it is not the first time i used it pancakes were cooked very unevenly maybe i'd rushed it maybe if given more time the heat would have evened out nope the second time i started it in a medium low heat before i even made up the batter i used a spot reading non contact digital laser infrared thermometer to test the temperature the difference between the areas over the induction coil and those adjacent to it were great and the difference never really closed putting on the pancakes worsened those differences as the batter stole heat from an area and conduction transfer could not keep up too bad that for apart from the serious deficiency this is a nice griddle but owing to this weakness i really can't recommend it right now little seems available that is induction compatible but i will keep on looking this was in the end a poor purchase wasted money i bought this months ago and have only used occasionally i am careful to use only wood and plastic utensils and hand wash despite my best efforts i can see that the coating is already scratched throughout the pan interior across almost the entire surface very disappointing there is certainly no pro in the nonstick unfortunately since i purchased this from amazon it is out of their day return policy so now i am basically stuck with a poor quality scratched surface pan definitely not going to by this type of expensive thing from amazon in the future also disappointed that amazon doesn't offer a better return policy if i had purchased at bed bath and beyond or other retailer they always honor the manufacturers warranty our cuisinart just arrived today as we were inspecting it we found out that there is a defect in one of the lids this saucepan is lbs and feels pretty heavy my kids are starting to cook at age and but a heavy pot is not something i need them to have to wrangle with and it's heavy for me too with nothing in it going to find a lighter pot other than that it was sturdy and nice looking pans warped cuisinart has a horrible customer service never again beautiful skillet and well engineered except everything sticks to it i have tried everything but i cannot even fry an egg in it without it sticking the only way i can successfully clean up the sticky mess is to soak the pain in hot water overnight with a dryer sheet floating in the pan the handles were too tall to fit on my range top it hit the control panel had to return it even though it was beautiful nice pan but bottom curved outwards after first few uses on a glass topped electric range now pan won't sit flat the quart pot arrived with a very small dent pit on the inside curve where the base meets the wall i believe it to clearly be a manufacturing defect and not damage due to shipping before purchasing the pot i read reviews that mentioned concerns about quality control but i decided to take a chance i totally regret making the purchase and i should have put the money towards a more expensive quality pot i looked into returning the pot but unfortunately the shipping costs would not be fully covered by amazon meaning it isnt worth sending back given the original price of the product the handles get super hot i keep forgetting and have burned myself more than once i have used this set for cooking everyday for the past month and for the price paid it was a good deal shipped from macy's during sale i also have and used the all clad stainless pans side by side and find the performance darn close all clad seems to clean up easier and the handles and lids do not get as warm as the cuisinart mcp though the mcp handles are a bit easier to hold when cleaning and are shorter i also noticed the cuisinart pots show white spotting from boiling water or other liquids but bar keepers friend cleans it up without issue i have read cuisnart no longer uses stainless to make these pots and considering cuisnart does not indicate the metal used anywhere i imagine it is something around or maybe a little better probably why the all clad cleans easier amazon needs to fix the description as it is not stainless i wish it came with the fry pan rather than the or but the is sufficient and the is great for a couple of eggs update the saute pan has warped a bit even with careful use i have tried to warranty the pan with no luck customer support is almost non existent i have called times been given a service authorization number of some sort and sent emails with required info and have not been contacted or provided any warranty service i guess you get what you pay for never had any problems with my all clad saute pans warping and if i did i have read their warranty is first class left stars since i still use pots update i finally got a replacement pan from cusinart so i upgraded my rating to stars we'll see how long this one lasts i really liked this pan it's heavy duty and non stick it says it could go into the oven and the dishwasher i didn't take a chance i hand washed it gently after each use i also registered it with cusinart before i even used it in less than one year the non stick lining began to roll off the rim see photo i decided to order an identical replacement when it arrived i noticed the box said it had a limited lifetime guarantee so i called cusinart customer service they said to take a photo of the damaged pan top and bottom and email it to their customer service staff who would follow up with instructions in days if they believed it was faulty i did so and got a ticket number from cusinart but despite numerous attempts to reach them since it's now been a few months and no word so i can only assume they will not stand behind their guarantee if you want to spend this much for a great pan that will last only a short time this is the pan for you i previously bought the l of this saucepan and liked it a lot it is a good solid pot so i thought i'd buy the matching l size the l however isn't quite the same quality as the larger pot the product stamp on the bottom of the pan was visible on the inside also making me think that there might be an issue with the thickness of the metal on the bottom knowing that i would be obsessing over this every time i used it i returned it for exchange and then the replacement was like this also both have now been returned although i still may buy another one some time in the future after amazon turns over all their stock a couple of times am i the only one that received saucepans with this flaw or maybe i am the only one who cares not as advertised warped and stained with minimal use first set was replaced but second set was no better so it was also returned for full refund i have had this pan about a year i take good care of our pans in particular my non stick i was expecting more from cuisinart the teflon has begun to peel from the edge of the pan we don't cook on super high heat and use only plastic utensils with our non stick just my husband and i here no kids that would have cooked with it my other cuisinart cookware has been great i took a chance on their non stick and lost frankly i bought a smaller non stick pan locally for less than this price i use that pan more often and it's still going strong years later don't know if i just got a lemon from cuisinart or not guess i'll go dig out my warranty i probably won't buy nonstick from cuisinart again nice saute' skillet broke it in sauteeing veggies no hot spots just fine end of july update weeks later only the second time i've used this pan cooking two slices of bacon on medium ceramic cooktop this pan stained inside and outside dark burn like spots no true stainless saute' pan would do this going back and will insist on gauge stainless o n l y trick will be to get refund after the one month point we purchased cuisinart s inch inch and inch nonstick multiclad pro skillets to use with a new induction cooktop and have appreciated the size weight and nonstick performance unfortunately the nonstick coating started peeling from the and inch skillets after months of use the t fal skillets they replaced are still going strong in another kitchen after years and we had assumed similar performance from the more expensive cuisinart pans we have made multiple calls to cuisinart customer service to inquired about the warranty but have never outlasted the phone queue some hot spots i wish that we had purchased the non stick a scotch brite pad will mar the internal finish and a plastic scrubee will not get them clean i have to hand wash each time i don't like to write bad reviews but i hate to see anyone else waste their money on this cookware it's too hard to clean leaves a residue that won't budge and is so easily scratched i can't imagine putting it in the dishwasher who wants such a fragile set of cookware i'm just glad i ordered the smaller set had to send it back because it would not work on my induction cooktop i thought i was very careful when selecting cookware for my induction cooktop but this was non functional for me i did send it back for a partial refund this set would probably be fine for gas stoves but if you have a flat top stove skip them the two skillets warped after a single use following their usage guidelines preheat over medium high heat and hand wash i returned these and bought an all clad set i added an extra star because they are beautiful pots and pans quite disappointing i have not had this pan for over two months and already food sticks to it it is lopsided so we cannot even cook all the food evenly with it terrible seems solidly built but started to warp after about months of mild use of course taking care to let it cool before putting it in cold water pan rocks about the center on a flat cooktop and spins like a top now this set is too heavy and too stick i only can use piece i want to return this item corroded rivet will leach metal into your foods purchased this pan and various other cookware from cuisinart in july of to use on our induction cooktop the box says that this pan is dishwasher safe but i have always hand washed it recently i have noticed the coating peeling off from the side of the pan i contacted the manufacturer and asked how to proceed i did not hear anything for about two weeks and contacted them again they then responded and asked me to send a picture of the bottom of the pan showing the serial number i sent the requested picture but they did not receive to make a long story short after much back and forth i have received the replacement pan today they are requesting me to pay shipping and handling for sending me the new pan for a defect that was the fault of the manufacturer i don't think i should have to pay for anything i found some pans at ikea at half the price that seem much sturdier and up to the task without peeling good size lousy so called stainless steel i bought this griddle specifically for my induction cooktop bridging burners i was optimistic because i measured before i ordered and i knew it would fit perfectly and i have loved the pans from this brand boy was i wrong i was so disappointed it took forever to heat up and only cooked where the burner was there was no heat distribution i will be purchasing a cheap electric griddle to replace this please save yourself some money and time don't buy this griddle cuisinart can't seem to make a roasting pan that's actually flat on the bottom the first was so warped it was unusable and the replacement had a large gouge out of the inside of the pan and was also warped obvious manufacturer defect no option to replace the second time not that i wanted to after the first two refund only pitting after one use in oven not what i expected got a return shipping label so sending it back for amazon credit recently have had bad experiences with cuisinart will not purchase their brand any more i now have an electric glass cook top after a kitchen renovation my old copper bottom pans no longer worked because when they heat up they warp after lots of research i settled on the cuisinart pans to replace my copper bottom pans i need pans that remain absolutely flat on my cooktop america's test kitchen rates cuisinart number well i think america's test kitchen must use gas for their tests because these cuisinart pans are terrible on a glass cooktop the first skillet warped immediately after consulting other reviews i knew to contact cuisinart customer service to get a replacement i jumped through all the hoops and finally received my replacement pan took it out of the box tonight washed it and tested it to make sure it was flat yes perfectly flat put oil in the pan turned the dial to medium and let the oil heat before adding the chicken pan immediately warped worse than the first one just rocks back and forth on top of the glass i am disgusted now what do i do how do i get my money back after this odyssey if you have a glass cooktop do not buy these cuisinart pans i'll call customer service in the morning but i do not have much faith that they will do anything i am stuck i purchased this and a few other multiclad pro pots to replace a set of year old revereware that had belonged to my grandmother i owned this pan for days it warped after uses back to the year old cookware it's not pretty but at least i can cook with it i am so dissapointed i just moved and decided to splurge on a nice set of stainless steel cookware they look amazing and are nice and heavy i was so excited to cook with them i am an experienced cook the food came out great and the pots cleaned super easy but then i looked at the pan it looks like a layer of film is peeling off the surface of the pan sigh i thought it was maybe just a defect in one pan so the next day i cooked some pasta in a different pot from the set after cleaning the pot and looking in it once again it looks like a layer of the pot is coming off i am afraid to use any of the other pots and pans in the set i'm worried that whatever is coming off could be harmfull to me and my family such a shame because other than this huge defect the cookware set is beautiful i am rating this as stars only because i am not happy with cuisinart's customer service position for replacing missing parts i ordered a piece multiclad pro cookware set it arrived in original packaging but included qt sauce pan lids in lieu of qt and qt lid i asked cuisinart to send me the correct lid but they refused instructing me to return the entire set to the seller or purchase the correct lid for as for the cookware set it is very nice and performs beautifully pots became discolored on the bottom after only a few uses looks like stainless is coming off had pot replaced replacement pots became pitted just as fast fresh out of the box this was a beautiful pan i was so excited to use it after the first use i discovered a bunch of pitting and flaking at the bottom of the pan it looked terrible unfortunately i was past the amazon return date so they advised me to contact cuisinart after calling their customer service they said i would have to pay to mail it back to them and then they would determine if they would send me a replacement which was no guarantee there is no way i was going to pay to ship this back to them when it wasn't even a sure thing that they would replace it for me so disheartened with my purchase and their customer service i didn't dare use the pan any more either as i wasn't sure it was safe to it eventually sat unused for so long because of that i just got rid of it and ate the cost i would definitely not recommend this product and would never purchase another cuisinart pan again this pan disappointed me i purchased it after reading reviews that compared the cuisinart mcp series favorably with all clad stainless but it either came warped or warped after only two uses i did not inspect it on arrival so do not know which it was now it won't sit flat on my stove top and rocks noticeably from side to side it will still see use in my kitchen but i won't be able to make things like crepes in it i was hoping to find a great pan for a lot less than all clad but this pan was not it the cuisinart multiclad pro line used to be great cookware now it's just good cookware the demotion comes at the expense of the new and improved handles they have affixed to these products they are not improved at all they are significantly less comfortable to hold with sharper edges one can only assume cuisinart is trying to sell us cheaply made and inferior products while telling us it's for our benefit shame on you cuisinart if this decision was truly for the stay cool properties you espouse i'm sure you could have figured out a way to also make them more comfortable not less i got annoyed enough typing this out i took off another star one for the change and one for the lie that it's for our benefit still recommended and decent cookware if you can get it on sale but not these handles not at this price please try again cuisinart still recommended on sale but these pots and pans just aren't what they used to be wish i could trade it for an old model worst investment i have made in a while poor quality stainless steel everything sticks i bought this pan because of the review on thesweethome com i have a new electric glass top stove the pan warped after a few uses and wouldn't sit flat on the stove after becoming warped it rocked constantly and the heating in the pan was very uneven amazon replaced the pan within a few days of my first complaint the new pan warped after one use sadly i'll be spending more than i wanted to try a inch all clad pan hopefully it will perform much better than the cuisinart handles to both pans and lids will burn you like other buyers had complaint the bottom of the pots is pilling and you see growing number of white spots actually the aluminum layer beneath the very thin steel and the customer service at cusinart is non existent worst buy on amazon ever looks gorgeous very hard to keep clean and looking gorgeous literally the worst pans i've ever used my husband bought these for us and you have to soak the pans in a special cleaner to get olive oil off of it and still have to scrub scrub scrub they're such a huge pain in the butt they're pretty but i avoid having to cook in them definitely going to have to call customer service and return these awful i got this item to be able to make bone broths in it the very first time i made some the rivets corroded badly very disappointed corroded rivets for more info check the reviews of people with similar problems loved the pan until it warped if you have a glass top electric stove do not buy this product i cannot address the product's performance on other cook tops but i never got to cook any food in the pan because it warped the first time i tried to use it i have other cuisinart stove top pans that i love but this is the second one that i have had warp the ones that i love have what seems to be a separate base attached to the bottom of the pan the two that warped don't have that what seems to be a stabilizing base this pan had so much potential if cuisinart had remembered that a usable pan will always outsell a pretty pan the first and only thing i did with this pot was boil salted water and pasta i was careful that the gas flame stayed under the pan and not around it that's pan care after cooking with and cleaning the pot according to directions i noticed several light spots of pitting on the inside bottom of the saucepan several passes with barkeeper's friend did nothing several soaks with vinegar did nothing the whitish pits remain i have several cuisinart cookware products large and small many have lasted over a decade of use and still look fantastic i've never seen this happen before i can only guess that these pans are imperfectly manufactured but made it past the inspection process i'll be replacing this saucepan with a similar product from calphalon or all clad with thicker more robust multiclad construction the price size weight and design of the cuisinart pot was just right but what good is that when it degrades the moment you use it just used my qt braiser for the nd time the first time was mostly in the oven but this nd time was on my induction stovetop it's warped oil pools on one side and it spins and rocks warped exchanging with amazon i hope the next one is better update i've received the second pan from amazon and it is also warped right out of the box see attached video this was filmed cold the spin is even more pronounced when the pan is hot i'm guessing that this has nothing to do with the manufacturing equipment in china is worn or out of wack and ever example of this model in this batch is going to do this cuisinart qa should have caught this i don't have any all clad or vollrath triply pans that spin on a high center like this in any event for i'll keep it but i was expecting better based on other reviews of this line update again i put the pan over an anvil protected by a couple pieces of scrap cork and whacked it with a hammer a few times it now sits pretty flat and no longer spins freely food constantly stinks to bottom of pan even on low heat also a nightmare to clean you can do much better elsewhere these do the job just fine but the handles are very uncomfortable for me so i would not buy them again for that reason much prefer the french series which we also have the reviews seem to highlight the pouring edge of the pro set which the french lacks but that has never been an issue for us i'd recommend researching cooking on ss before buying using if accustomed to non stick cookware technique is slightly different but not a big deal once used to it so far all the terrible instances of food sticking and burning on due to inattention have been resolved by pouring hot water on the pans while they're still on the fire and scraping the pan with a nylon utensil we have the joseph joseph set initial excitement to have a griddle compatible with my induction top unfortunately within two weeks it warped and the temperature wasnt even of the induction top's capacity i regret not getting a electric griddle and calling it done finding it hard to keep clean i gotta say i'm pretty disappointed in this try i got it for x mas and specifically requested this one there were cheaper ones but i decided to go for a little more expensive one because i have always trusted cuisinart however i have used this twice and both times left permanent burn marks on the surface during the searing process on the stove roasting trays are supposed to last a very very long time and at this rate i don't see this lasting more than a couple years needless to say the next roasting try wont be from cuisinart i got this set in december and followed all instructions provided by cuisinart i already have problems with little brownish spots on one saucepan and i've never put them in the dishwasher i give it stars because the frying pan worped a little after a couple of uses i did not use high heat it is very hard to get to cuisinart customer service i gave up after waiting minutes several times everything sticks returned it i received these for a wedding shower gift and was really excited to ditch the mismatched pots and pans my husband and i had been using since college the pots are great i mean they certainly do the job of boiling water for pasta and making soup the pans however are a nightmare i thought at first that i was just inexperienced at cooking with stainless steel so i did some research and tweaked my cooking methods nothing has helped everything burns chars and sticks it really is the biggest disappointment i wish these had been purchased at a store rather than amazon because i'd literally load them up and return them but seeing as i no longer have the box and would have to figure out some crazy shipping arrangement it looks as if i'll just be buying some new ones cooks great hard to clean pans turn brown from heat waste of money two pots with finish defects contacted manufacture four times fifteen minutes on hold every time sent photos twice the photos and emails were lost they stalled long enough that amazon return is not possible they want us to return new products at our expense is the defective finish a safety issue buy a different manufactures product buy from a local store with a good return policy feels quality it's large and can be unstable in the pot it's sitting in even though it's a matching cuisinart pot overall it's a good pot though nice pan wasn't big enough so didn't use this pan is inches wider than a standard large stove burner about inches how can it be used to saute or brown meat before placing in oven if you had hoped to use it for stove top browning before placing in the oven this is the wrong sized pan for you you want one of standard large burner size inches that is deeper disappointed that the finish came off the rivets after the finish wash i know the dishwasher over time is not recommended but it was these pots and lids only in the dishwasher and didn't use lemon cleaner it was for the first wash only before use and the rivets came out looking dull hopefully the set overall holds up better than that paid extra to get what i thought was better quality set after using this pot about times the coating is already pitting and flaking off on the inside i only boiled some water and made some steamed rice i never abused the pot at all i always used a wooden spoon not as high quality as what is advertised we chose these pans for our new induction cooktop only to find the bottoms of the pans were concave this meant the bottom didn't rest flat on the burner and the induction cooktop would not work with them we are now searching for new pans that have flat bottoms know what you're getting these pans are high maintenance i can't deal with the fact that pretty much everything sticks in the saute pans i know this is the point with some dishes so that you can deglaze also keeping them in looking nice is a pain if you're into that prepare to scrub with barkeepers friend after each use gave these away to my son and switched to anolon advance bronze which are excellent product performed well but stained after only once use returned for diminished quality after one use got this pan and loved it it heated very nicely and evenly did not stick or anything within a week it warped and the bottom is no longer flat as such it doesn't sit right on the stove burner and gets hot spots and half of it is a lot hotter than the other half this has made cooking in it quite problematic on top of that it has developed a weird white spotty stain in it that's only visible when it's dry see pictures i have emailed cuisinart's customer service over a week ago and have gotten no response at all this pot looks good except for a few blemishes on the inside of the pot i looked on the saute pan i had just purchased which is the same as this cuisinart multi clad pro stainless and there are no flaws in the metal at all that is why i am sending this one back for a replacement amazon is great they are sending me a new one as i type this review out they're ok not all clad but they do look similar just not the same quality i am extremely disappointed by the quality of the set i bought for myself for christmas the food stick to the bottom of the pot most of the time do not buy it you will regret it the non stick coating started peeling from the edges after years i guess it doesn't stick to the pan very well either disappointed the frypans are extra stick i was a bit skeptical about the rivets issue believing that a small number of folks simply ended up with a bad batch so i went ahead and ordered the quart stockpot this past dec first thing i did was to test whether it had the corroding rivets issue fresh out of the brand new packaging box i rinsed the inside with water and then filled it with just under quarts of cold tap water making sure the rivets were submerged then i also added tablespoons of white distilled vinegar a mild acid i placed it over the stove and turned up the heat until the water temperature was high enough to start a few small bubbles to form on the bottom of the pot guessing it reached around f then turned off the heat and placed the lid on and allowed it sit for hours eight hours later the results show the rivets did react with the very very mildly acidic water and vinegar combination i can feel small pits in the rivets with my fingers and some material has definitely been eroded save yourself the trouble do not buy this pot unless you want to find out on your own the hard way cuisinart needs to recall this product and check each pot for this defect before it puts it back on sale again this may be a health and safety issue that warrants such action a solid roaster admirable and affordable but the one i received had a bowed up base such that only the ends of the pan would touch a flat surface returned it the manufacturer's apparent lack of quality control boggles my mind advice test the base of yours with a long straight edge before initial use very heavy with slow warm up time everything sticks and stains the pots things tend to stick on this pan not a good casserole pan as it left a ring where the burner was at the bottom going to return i bought this product one month ago its pretty sensitive to handle and care after first use i found a lot of spots tiny black hole marks over it product did not meet my expectations nonstick coating began peeling off from the edge in a continuous sheet after months of normal use no scratches or other abuse evident only paid dollars for this unit so i'm not sure it's worth the warranty fee plus shipping to get another given the number of reports of this same issue i cannot recommend the cuisinart nonstick products i can't believe the reviews but the quart pot i received is trash the rivets connecting the handle are aluminum and corrode in the presence of acidic food i've attached a photo of what the rivets look like after a single acidic use the handle is comfortable the parts that are stainless are good enough and the pot seems certainly thick enough to not easily warp none of this is relevant if you can't build a stainless steel pot that doesn't corrode in the presence of common cooking ingredients such as tomatoes maybe this product line was once good but i don't understand having this high of reviews for products that cut costs on the details this is not a spot of corrosion this is a defect in the materials selected for constructing the pan it does not have an all stainless interior i wonder what precious cents they saved by using aluminum rivets instead of stainless but in the end it takes what could have been great and makes it unusable sadly i'll have to go look for another affordable tri ply pot or bite the bullet on something significantly more expensive the lack of care in the construction here makes me question purchasing from cuisinart these pans are only as shiny as new prior to first use i believe stainless steel is nice for cooking but do not expect the insides of the pans not to discolor upon first use the weight is great shiny and look nice but so easy to scratch after returning our original pan due to the bottom not being flat amazon quickly sent out a replacement unfortunately the replacement has a warped base too and will have to be returned i'm not sure if this is a defect or how the pan should be i need a flat bottom roaster for gravies and deglazing since this has a warped base it causes pooling in the corners most people in the question and answers say it should be flat so i dont think it should warped if it was flat then i'm sure it would be a good pan i tried searing a steak over high heat it warped the bottom of the pan so that it doesn't sit flat on my stovetop any more giving it to goodwill and getting cast iron ikeas version is much thicker and cheaper stars because i can't rate it's cooking abilities like too many others my new pan arrived with several half inch or so gouges that went through the steel into the aluminum layer below if they'd been on the outside of the pan i wouldn't have minded much as the price was very good but they were all where the floor transitions to the sidewalls a place where food is sure to collect cuisinart needs to seriously invest in improved quality control returned for refund i purchased this item in december to use for thanksgivings it was used in and was great but when we used it this year for the turkey the handle of the rack came off while lifting the turkey out of the pan needless to say we had a mess i expect an almost pan to last for more than one use very disappointed in this item nice even heat distribution solid construction however i put it on our electric cooktop cold turned the burner on to gently heat it the first time and it immediately warped unusable on the electric cooktop now some of the other reviews compared this set to all clad i have owned a few all clad pieces before and there is no comparison this is not even close to all clad in quality or durability ever so disappointed to say that clean up is a bear is an understatement these pans are no different than the pans your grandmother used back in the s where you had to soak them to get them clean think i'm kidding if you read the directions for care that come with the set they states that you need to soak them with warm soapy water immediately after use as another reviewer noted truly not a non stick pan and worst of all they scratch so very easily i made mashed potatoes and i was gentle and careful with the masher no i did not use an electric mixer in the pan yup you guessed it the pan is now scratched i suppose i should not be surprised given the price point on these pans i just wish i had known what little durability they had before i purchased them was so excited to receive the cookware set but used one of the pans and was deeply disappointed just boiled water for eggs one time and now have something in the bottom of the pan that looks like the stainless has come off unbelievable i just don't know what to do i love this set it is beautiful but don't want o keep this pan and wonder if the others will do this also i haven't even had the set a week i hate to give these stars but being an armature in the kitchen i didn't know what i was getting myself into i have always had non stick pans and i just assumed all pans were non stick boy was i wrong i tired several attempts to cook food such as eggs potatoes even just melting butter it stuck to the pan every single time i finally googled what i was doing wrong and realized i needed to season the pan prior to using after a few months i seasoned a pan made dinner and it magically was non stick surface having known i would have to do this prior to using each pan i would not have purchased these pans however i love the quality of the pans they are very heavy sturdy and feel like a quality product for a true cook these would be great practice makes perfect i suppose bought item for thanksgiving turkey used it once and bottom pitted i am so disappointed with these pots pans i originally wanted all clad but didn't want to pay the high price these had great reviews plus i've always liked the cuisinart brand so i thought this would be a good purchase when i purchased them december the description said all pieces were dishwasher safe however i now see that it has changed to say only the lids are dishwasher safe if i had known this i would have never purchased them as i prefer to put them through the dishwasher about of the time the reason i was looking to buy new pots pans was because our old belgique set also had the same layering with the aluminum core exposed on the outer edge they had it on the bottom these have it on the top that means that when they go through the dishwasher the detergent eats away at the aluminum and quite quickly it is worn down enough that the stainless layers become sharp and can cut you if you hit is just right i absolutely hate these pots pans now and would not recommend them i am now on the hunt for all clad and after this experience i am more willing to pay the higher price this is a great looking set and performs as described that said the guart sauce pan etched after the first use i contacted customer service and sent the money for replacement shipping weeks ago and haven't heard a word the jury is still out on customer service if and when i receive the replacement pan i wiould the the product stars i have also ordered additional items amazing i received them in days all i did was boil water in it one time and the center of the cooking surface is already bubbled up and there's a small black spot that feels like a burr i think a small part of the stainless is punctured you can see both in the picture i attached i don't know if the pan came that way or if just boiling water caused it but yeah i'd pass on this pan cuisinart isn't what it was years ago both skillets warped after just a couple of uses although i followed the use and car instructions to the letter the both wobble on the cooktop surface and as a result no longer heat evenly this issue appears to be widespread based on other reviews extremely disappointed given the price also the warranty replacement appears to be more time consuming and costly than buying a different brand of skillets last time i buy cuisinart only three stars because handles become to hot the first time i used one of the pans it was a dish involving melted butter the butter that melted just off the food left a permanent discoloration on the pan i've tried everything from the vinegar water boil to a five star pbw soak overnight the second pan has food stuck to the pan after the second use what a waste i have a hard time keeping things from sticking to the sides and always have to scrub it hard with a metal scrub brush to clean it unlike similar products i've used in past will heat up fast and you have to watch the temp to keep sauces from overheating i ordered this as a replacement when my last griddle started to warp in the middle this one looked pretty good but after the first use i could tell it wasn't very good the two main issues with it are the handles and the non stick surface the stainless handled get hot as hrll from cooking if you're looking for hand burns this is the product for you the other issue was the non stick surface or lack thereof after the first week of use and always being hand washed things started to stick to it now after a few months everything sticks to it it's pretty useless at this point unless you have no choice avoid this p o s i purchased the mcp n set as well as both sizes of casserole love the set and the smaller casserole but am very disappointed with the larger size in about six months and a similar number of uses don't use a pan this size every day its bottom has warped significantly to the point that it's not useful on a glass top stove maybe the problem is that the center heats up too much more than the edge does how many stoves have inch burners but i've taken every reasonable precaution slow initial heat never too hot plenty of time to cool down and all to no avail i don't think this is a problem with materials or workmanship i think it's a fundamental design flaw i thought this cookware set was great looking when i received them looked high quality too however the first thing i cooked on it was an egg it stuck bad and was hard to get off disappointedly i tried cooking other things and the password great for everything else i kept a nonstick pan from my old set to use for eggs if you do cook eggs in these pans you'll need to use lots and lots of butter or oil frittatas stick even if spraying with pam before hand we have an induction cooktop which this griddle straddles perfectly however even though the parts of the griddle directly over a burner do a fine job the section which is not directly over the burners only becomes warm since we bought it so that we would have access to the entire griddle and this is not the case we might as well just use two skillets functional but not up to the quality standards i would expect i have previously purchased and used extensively the quart stock pot and shortly after purchasing the piece multiclad pro set purchased the quart sauce pan as it seemed that size would be useful to add to the set i love the quart stock pot it has seen a lot of use and is still in great condition the quart sauce pan and the piece set are another matter however while these items function well from the stand point of even heating speed of heating lid fit and handle usefulness some of the pan and pot pieces developed small pitting spots with in a few uses i worry these will lead to food sticking more and more in the future and that even more pitting will occur in essence it seems the quality is very variable as with many goods made in china over all i cannot recommend this cookware line functional but not up to the quality standards i would expect i have previously purchased and used extensively the quart stock pot and the piece multiclad pro set i love the quart stock pot it has seen a lot of use and is still in great condition the quart sauce pan and the piece set are another matter however while these items function well from the stand point of even heating speed of heating lid fit and handle usefulness some of the pan and pot pieces developed small pitting spots with in a few uses i worry these will lead to food sticking more and more in the future and that even more pitting will occur in essence it seems the quality is very variable as with many goods made in china over all i cannot recommend this cookware line does not heat evenly and poorly conducts heat from the induction elements to the food overall disappointed in the product the real problem to why i don't like this item is everything i try to fry such as eggs in particular i can't get it out of the pan without it getting all scrambled up and sticking i have sprayed oil cold and warmed slowly before placing egg in pan i believe i have done everything i can think of very displeased maybe i'm not that great of a chef but everything sticks to these pots cleanup hasnt been a major problem but i do have cloudy ghostly shadows of beans that i had simmering in the small pot i'm not sure how to get rid of this semi stain these pots and pans do look really nice but as for cooking no amount of oil will stop food from sticking so far the best use of these pots and pans has been quick evening cooking of soups and sauces in the pots i am afraid to use the pans for fear of everything sticking anything that has some type of breading or coating is sure to be left in the pan dont even think of scrambling an egg there'll be more egg in the pan than on your plate i'm quite disappointed with this cookware set not bad need to be careful with the bigger saute pan you can easily overheat the center and warp the pan also the large stock pot has rivets made from a metal that does not play nice with our city water and its corroding after just a couple of uses started pitting on second use would not buy again going back to old brand the non stick coating started peeling off a little over one month after purchase cuisinart replaced the skillet and the second one peeled in the same way cuisinart has a problem with their quality control i've never seen a nonstick pan peel from the edges like this and now it has happened to me twice without a doubt the worst set of cookware i've ever owned i followed all the directions on pre use and don't go over medium heat but no matter what i do everything sticks every piece of the cookware sticks in fact it's so bad we moved it to a corner and went back to using our iron cookware i honestly try not to leave negative reviews but after trying anything and everything i could think of including reading several forums to keep these from sticking they stick and they just suck i found on several forums people complaining of the same thing this was money just wasted and i mean wasted i purchased these based on reviews but will not buy this brand again i think there's a major quality issue with the brand or at least this line because of so many mixed reviews it's odd to find especially something as simple as cookware have so many mixed reviews i ordered the skillet in feb and am writing this review in sept my family used this pan approximately time per week over that period of time the pan was a great size and the teflon surface was non stick i loved the pan until the last few weeks the teflon coating has begun to bubble and peel and i can no longer use the pan due to fears of the teflon coming off during cooking and being ingested by my family everything else about the pan was great but for i would definitely have expected it to last longer as others are saying the teflon coating is literally peeling off in a sheet on all three skillets that i have and inch the stainless steel pans in this series are great so disappointed cuisinart what a waste of money i got a used saucepan strong smell and scratches' on the body and bottom returned everything sticks to pan used a dozen times and the teflon is peeling it is so fragile i can peel it off with my fingernail so i bought this pan from a local culinary tore but thought i'd review here to warn you anyway i saw some of the negative reviews here before deciding to buy but ignored them due to the overwhelming umbwr of positive reviews when i got the pan out thought it was stunning then i noticed a scratch on the inside that went down to the black aluminum core being and building up my first kitchen i decided to ignore it and use it for a chicken i was roasting that night i assure you i only used wooden utensils the chicken was on a rack and some veggies with the drippings were below still when i cleaned it handwash with warm water a soft sponge and a gentle noncitrus dish soap i noticed several divets in it after just one use each divet goes down to the core i was extremely excited to buy my first high quality and rather pricey for this phase of my life piece of cookware but now i'll be calling to see if the store will let me return it a beautiful waste of money after one use the pans have stains in the bottom no matter how many times they are washed the stains keep coming back bought this because the bottom was supposed to be flat for use with induction flat top stove its nowhere near flat the center of the bottom was concave by or roughly the thickness of a sd card used once at slightly higher temperature and the bottom of the large skillet warped extremely poor quality update amazon exchanged the skillet in august the replacement started warping after a few uses and is now warped as much if not more than the original one in the attached image the skillet is sitting on a perfectly flat stove top it appears that this product is not suitable for use on an electrical stove i've used this set for a full year now and i can't wait to replace it the biggest issue the rivet buttons for the handles on the cookware and lids are corroding and rusting i am sure it's not harmful i can't find info on it no matter how i phrased it on google and we feel fine so i am assuming it's calcium or lime build up and i am not a total priss but these white crusty knobs with rust around the edges are getting really disturbing i have cookware pieces from at least other sets and some of them are super cheap random things of a useful size i inherited from my mother and none of them have this issue even with barkeepers friend cleaning powder and special scrubbing pads that we have used since day one this set is much harder to keep clean and after only a year they are showing more signs wear and tear on their surface than my mother's yr old pots that have survived several generations of abuse from babies and newbie cooks about the only good thing i can say about this set is the sizes of everything is perfect this might sound like a small thing but it's really kinda huge perhaps this set is all standard sizes for the types of pots and pans but i am upgrading from an oddball mix i inherited from several family members so each lid would fit only one pot or pan and no other which sucked and the burners on the range never lined up with the bottom of the cookware properly there was always some weird over or underlap going on also something to consider i thought the solid metal lids would be no big deal but after a couple uses i wanted my old glass lids back didn't realize how much i had liked that feature til it was gone very nice feel very poor for cooking since day one as a chef that has used hundreds of pans pots i find this collection very disappointing they're beautiful and have nice weight food sticks badly even with nonstick sprays proper temperature i feel like i should've just bought a less expensive sam's club nonstick pans these pots look and feel really nice with a nice weight to them the brushed exterior is a nice finish the problem i have is that the fry pan warped after the first use i have an electric ceramic cooktop so a pan that doesn't lay flat won't work properly for me even if i was cooking on gas the pan warped enough that it has a fair amount of wobble and spins easily i still wouldn't like cooking with it i followed the instructions and never brought the heat above medium in fact i never brought the heat to medium i also had a couple of small looking rust spots form on the bottom as well as some weird discoloration that would not remove with bkf unfortunate because i really wanted to like these pans but i am now concerned for the longevity of them they will be returned after a couple of uses the fry pan has lost it's flatness curing the deep skillet started off ok but notice a light wobble the smaller fry pan was flat until under heat now they all wobble and i'm pretty sure it's not something i did otherwise it's a beautiful set but i was expecting these pans to stay flat may look at the all clad line now to replace the wobbly pans i've had this for around two months and the inside is peeling off not just flaking off in tiny pieces peeling off in one giant layer the product is clearly sold as dishwasher and oven safe as well as safe at high temperatures making eggs in it once or twice a week should not have damaged it especially not this much do not buy i've included a picture of the bottom to show that i'm not accidentally reviewing a different product this pan really is this bad this is an extremely nice pot except that the lid handle gets screaming hot when i boil water less expensive pots have plastic or insulated lid handles very heavy to handle as others mentioned cuisinart lost quality control of this pot made in china and rivets made of aluminium corrode easily for the products made almost from the end of till now mid of product is returned hopefully they fix this issue soon i have used this for about two months when i first received the pan it wobbled a little bit on a flat surface thankfully it has not warped any more than this however i do not think these are flat bottomed pans as mine clearly is approximately mm deeper in the center of the pan i do like the way it cooks and i want to love this pan i am just very sad that the pan is not level if you have a gas range this pan would be great i just used my brand new to cook pasta yes boil water cook pasta then stirred a little butter and parmesean in after washing this is what my pot looks like after one use didn't even put it in the dishwasher this was hand washed needless to say i'm severely disappointed in this product i was so happy by how beautiful they looked but clearly they'll all be trash after a few uses in short this pot heats evenly quickly and cleans up well unfortunately because it conducts heat so well only the first inches or so of the handle is cool enough to use barehanded not enough natural grip for me use of over mitts or an after market handle slip cover is an absolute necessity with this product adding to its already premium cost stars for cooking efficiency and surface quality stars for handle heat issue cooking in them is just advertised even cooking temperature throughout but they are not stainless in fact the first time i boiled pasta in one of the pots it discolored and stained inside the outside has lots of water spots that you would think would wipe right off but they don't i have better stain resistance from my walmart pots not happy this item does not heat evenly i used it once it had hot spots very unhappy why every pan i buy no matter what i spend has uneven heat i do not want it to be hotter directly over the flame than it is out at the edges the overall construction of it of course is cuisinart great the non stick surface and the stainless bottom you are really limited in what you can make in these pans everything sticks even when oiled and on medium heat want to flip an egg without breaking the yolk these are not the pans for that only dishes like red beans rice don't stick to these they look nice and are easy to keep looking nice i just can't get past the fact that you need a half cup of grease to keep stuff from sticking to them nice looking pans you can't always stack them as they get caught inside each other ended up buying ceramic non stick frying pan after this set and while easier to clean if i use the right amount of oil they are all about the same this multiclad set is nice love the pans and the handles my problem is the rivets i seldomly cook however i constantly have a wife in my ear telling my how the rivets are rusting corroding i purchased bartenders friend gets rid of the crap but the problem isn't solved accumulates every few uses before you gotta use it again long story short do i like the pans yes are the sizes appropriate yes are there a few issues that could use resolving yes would i recommend this to a friend not at the moment if they fixed their very minor deficiencies then yes fix the corrosive rivets make them from stainless steel stop deceiving customers only days on and the nonstick coating is peeling off my large pan we've been very careful with these pans and the coating is literally peeling off around the edges very disappointed pan was returned pan returned pans are beautiful but are really heavy and keeps water spots on them unless you dry immediately with kids this for me hard at times and the larg skillet is warped on the bottom does lay flat there for food burns in the middle or cooks faster love the steamer would really like to give this set a better rating but after owning them for just a few short weeks they look terrible they don't clean up easily and no longer look like shiny new pots even using special cleaner doesn't help make them look better quite disappointed with them overall these are the most expensive pots and pans i've bought unfortunately they are not worth the money they are a challenge to clean especially with something heavy like eggs or sauces several have burned at the bottom and it won't come off i would recommend buying something else everything sticks to the bottom it stains easily rust spots appeared after the first use i didn't add salt until the water was boiling we bought this for thanksgiving of last year and noticed that there were some deep gouges on the underside we figured that since it wasn't on a cooking surface it wasn't worth returning however after just one use we noticed that some flaking pitting occurring on the inside right in the middle we do not use the roasting pan on the stovetop so there's no chance that it's due to over heating just one spot we figured that it might be a one time thing so we used it again and another section started to pit flake by this point we were past amazon's return policy date it took a while for cuisinart to get back to us but we were able to start the warranty process only to discover that this item isn't available in canada so there's nothing they can do even though they admit that it looks like a manufacturing defect i know it's been several months but is there anything that amazon can do to help i did a lot of research looking for the best stainless steel cookware set because this is so highly rated on multiple sites i trusted it was a good product it is not in fact it's quite terrible after just one use the inch skillet is basically useless it is covered in cooked on grease that won't come off even with vigorous scrubbing it is now permanently discolored even in the few spots that i was able to remove what i had just cooked for the record all i cooked was a fried egg in a little bit of olive oil i will be returning pronto do not buy i'll start out by saying i have the mcp piece set and really love it i purchased this pan separately but i was surprised to find out it is not nearly the quality of the rest of the series the bottom is noticeably thinner even flexible the whole pan weighs considerably less than the much smaller qt saucepan i am returning this pan without even using it and going to search for something else the same size with better quality the rounded bottom on this double boiler makes it way less user friendly than it needed to be the rest of the cuisinart multiclad line is great but the rounded bottom not fun to deal with pan is fine description misleading pan is only tall not that dim was to top of handle on cover not height of pan i know these are quality items but i hate that food sticks to the pan and it is a real pain to clean i was use to non stick and now i am stuck with these too late for me to return because i had to go out of state for weeks and could not return with in the time period my loss i really do not like these pans any one want them lol i was searching qt saucer and found this i owned other brand multi clad or tri clad pots and pans so i compared this to them i think it is decent quality handle is not so impressive it is not big and thick enough to lift qt pot my favorite handle is cooks standard worst is all clad design problem one thin handle is not enough for this qt pot it surely needs a small supporting handle on the other side with food inside it gets really heavy and carrying the pot with this skinny handle is very very hard i don't plan to fill it with only cup of sauce or something i bought this size because i wanted to cook something more than qt for that the one skinny handle is not even close so now i understand why many other companies do not make qt pot with one handle because it is so hard to lift or carry the bottom warped in two weeks made it useless on my glass cooktop the pan warped on the bottom and that made it unusable on my induction cook top i never cooled the pan to quickly so their was no reason for it to warp that i could see fantastic set for the price point couldn't be happier this set did not work for me just installed a new induction cooktop and needed the right cookware most food would stick and the pots and pans quickly became discolored high maintenance i returned them i have used a cuisinart multiclad pro set for more than years and loved it still use it every day it has been through any manner of recipes and countless cycles of the dishwasher and looks as good as the day i bought it boy has the quality of their products gone downhill since then after only one use of this pot the rivets turned black i thought maybe it was a coating or something and used a scotchbrite pad and that gouged the rivets they couldn't possible be stainless steel i contacted cuisinart and they sent a new pot same problem now here's the thing the rivets on the lid that came with it are fine no discoloration they are shiny and hard just like my year old set its clearly a manufacturing problem with the rivets on the pot very sad update the pot comes with a lifetime warranty and i've had it replace four times a total of five pots and every single one of them had the same problem to a varying degree oddly every time i contacted customer service they would ask did you put salt in before you boil water what first i didn't buy this pot to boil water i cook in it second if they are suggested the pot has a problem boiling water anyway i sprung for a similar all clad williams sonoma was having a sale and i had an old gift card from a friend i'm sure it will be worth every penny over the years don't buy it if you love to cook all the pan stick i am totally disappointed i had to turn a piece because after using it once it had pockmarks on the bottom amazon graciously did an exchange and no problem since i purchased a set with a manufacture date stamped on the bottom of this appears to be a great value and i was inclined to buy due to the great reviews value however as a previous reviewer commented the rivets on the inside of the stockpot and one of the sauce pots all that i have used so far already have began corroding oxidizing and food sticks to them where the oxidation corrosion have occurred making it extremely difficult to clean plus barkeepers friend is not recommended for aluminum if in fact the rivets are aluminum on my products which would cause further degradation i will say i have some much more expensive pieces of all clad and while i was trying to save a buck you get what you pay for i really do not want to be eating aluminum particles and am concerned with long term durability of this product maybe i just received a bad batch as it appears there are many happy campers with this set mine however are going back while i can still return these pots and pans are horrible especially concidering the price wow i bought these hoping they would be the last set of pots and pans i would ever need they are solid metal no plastic no rubber no glass no coatings how could you go wrong they should last forever wrong the rivets connecting the handles to the pans have already started to wear after only using them twice the nice polished finish has worn threw and the rivets like look like horrible pitted out cast aluminum that could snap at any second this is the second set of stainless steel pans i've bought from from this manufacturer the first met its end rubber or silicone coated stay cool handles fell right off when i was draining my pasta furious don't buy this product i beg you i did a bunch of research and purchased this over the all clad because of price and reviews it's heavy duty the bottom is thick and sturdy handles are nice and works with induction sadly the first time we cooked a full pot of chili in it the rivets holding the handles from inside pot corroded quite extensively and we will return just not quite comfortable having any kind of metal in our food and there was a lot of pitting after one use a shame because otherwise great product they just need to fix this used one of the wide omelet pans one time heard metal cracking and it permanently discolored after one use a bit big and bulky but fits well in my all clad qt pot bought in for a new kitchen on the third use late construction took way longer than expected it warped my pots and small frying pans are fine with months of use but this and the dutch oven from the full set i ordered at the same time are totally warped junk now rivets rusted and became extremely corroded after only one use returned set and it happened to the second set otherwise nice looking and feeling set wish the rivets were better all foods stick regardless of what are you cooking will never buy this product again and will definitely not recommended not even to my worst enemy when i called cuisinart directly the said that the life warranty is only if the product actually is broken well that is almost impossible due to a hard material that they are made of however it's make you not wanting to use the product because it ruin your cooked meals i'm glad that i bought it from amazon com i was able to return it i really appreciate it i sent this as a gift to my friend but we had to return it because of a defect in the center of the pan it looked like a raised blob i ordered a replacement for him the second pan looked exactly like the first he photographed the pan and sent the photos to cuisinart a customer service rep responded that it qualified for replacement and for a charge we could return it directly to them or he said we could return it to amazon for free we will purchase another brand if you look at the bottom of the pan it appears the stamping of the logo raised the center of the pan very disappointing quality very disappointing customer service the base is not flat there is a groove running all the way around the edges of the pan this makes deglazing much more difficult i don't know why they say that it's flat when it isn't but they lied otherwise the pan is good it's sturdy easy to lift everything it should be if it were flat it would be perfect rivets were destroyed with st use while making spaghetti sauce they completely corroded they are definitely not stainless steel as advertised i really wanted to like these but the rivets are made from a different material than the pan itself if you cook anything acidic with the rivets submerged they corrode tested with chili returned and ordered a replacement cooked chili again and the rivets corroded first time very disappointing if you're expecting all clad quality look elsewhere i purchased these in november of with the hopes to never purchase a new set for yrs i have really pampered these pans the issue i have with them is they are no longer flat on the bottom so for my glass cooktop they wobble too much and don't maintain enough contact thus taking more time and electricity to cook anything complete waste of money everything sticks to them and they are hard to clean do not purchase these if you want something that is a nonstick surface i'm about to throw them away i was very happy at first but after months the inside of pot has started pitting like it is low quality stainless i purchased a quart pot around the same time and it is fine my wife however really likes the qt size my wife and i purchased cuisinart classic over yrs ago and it is fine just normal wear very disappointed in the quality i love cuisinart products however when this arrived it had several pit marks in the bottom of the pan i should have listened to the other reviewers i sent it back right away i really want to love this pan and would give it five stars i have several mcp covered saucepans and they are fantastic this one came out of the box flat but seemed lighter than i was expecting especially compared to the saucepans my smooth top maytag stove doesn't get particularly hot i've never had issues with it hotspotting or overheating various other pans and pots whether anodized aluminum carbon or stainless steel heck it even has trouble getting to gelling temperatures in my quart mauviel copper jam pan tonight i was very excited to use the new skillet to brown some skinless chicken breasts and root vegetables and set it to pre heat on medium high about on the knob's scale and actually lower than i use with my aluminum and nonstick pans after a couple of minutes i oiled it and added the chicken and it immediately felt wobbly crap i finished cooking and it cleaned up fine and indeed looks new other than the warp i do however now see a faint deformation in the center which corresponds with the cuisinart stamp on the bottom is this a particularly thin pan it seems thinner than the cheap tramontina single ply ss pan it has replaced i will contact cuisinart in the morning i bought the quart version and it was great for about months it conducts heat evenly and cleans up easily however the bottom started to warp so that the middle bulges out it makes it impossible to heat food evenly had i known it was going to warp in less than a year i would have bought a different brand this is my third multiclad piece of cookware and my least favorite it is true to size of a nice heavy weight and has a sturdy helper and handle however this has three rough edges on the rim rough as in sharp i have found this to be much more challenging to wash than my other two multiclad pots quart and quart pots and my cast iron i can cook very simple sauteed items in this pan and that is about it i am glad that i have it i replaced a very poor nonstick pan with this since it is not ideal to cook tomato sauces in cast iron but for the most part i will stick with my cast iron for any type of frying eggs meat etc and breads and pan cakes it is a good stainless steel pan but i feel that the quality control was not there as for the cooking i will just have to get used to what this pan can handle cast iron can cook anything literally from delicate crepes to hearty meatloaves happy cooking warped after two steaks never broke over out of on temperature on my electric glass stove spins real nice now though should have put down an extra for the all clad i am so disappointed i thought i did my research but apparently wasn't enough everything sticks and i mean everything doesn't matter how much oil or grease or pam is used your food will stick to the surface which is why it is important to buy the stainless steel polish and sponge pad that is recommended with this product i am not sure if i will have to just dump the whole set very very disappointed i like the even cooking on these but they are very hard to keep clean purchased pot to make stock after the rd time all four rivets became pitted white disgusting disappointing i'm a big fan of my multiclad pro stainless sauce pans but this skillet is a disappointment i originally bought this pan when i lived in an apt with a gas stove so it performed pretty well now i live in an apt with a flat cooktop and it performs rather miserably because the pan is not flat on the bottom like other reviews the model i received is concave by a bit i've taken great care of this pan too handwashing only when the pan has naturally cooled down no abrasives i'm writing cuisinart's customer service on this and will update the review with the resolution if any update i had to send photos to them but they responded positively by saying they'd send a replacement in business days will update again when the replacement comes update just received the replacement and it's not perfectly flat but it's a big improvement over what it replaced liquids don't pool to edges i've included a comparison of the two pans upgrading the review from to stars great quality however not sure why they picked the sizes in the set they did the only reason i gave the set a just okay was not for the quality but for more desirable sizes for ordinary cooking it would be nice if they included a couple of two quart pots in the set a friend came over and saw my pots and said she has a set too and has never used the quart one i can't imagine when i would ever need to use the quart pot either i went on line to see if i could add on to the set with a couple of two quart pots but to no avail this is supposed to be stainless steel cookware but one of them had a surface blemish and it rust after i was it see the pic below i ll have to contact amazon for a replacement or exchanged the whole set it is just waste of time i am disappointed a highly recoended set of cookware came defective we bought these a year ago through a different vendor the biggest problem is they are terrible at heat transfer good either takes forever to hear up and cook or it gets too hot and burns or sticks to the metal dont waste your time or money we recommend you go to costco and purchase either one of the two kirkland brand sets for a far superior and cheaper product these pans are going in my camping gear as trash pans dont buy save your time and money i bought this inch frying pan exactly year ago for my wife's christmas present a few months ago the teflon coating is peeling off at the edges it's not being scrapped off it is actually peeling off as a sheet i am also having the same problem with the similar inch teflon coated frying pan i have just contacted cuisinart about this problem and am waiting for their reply i will update this review in the future after searching for similar problems via google i would say i am not alone at this point i would not recommend the purchase of cuisinart teflon coated pans very disappointed with this set of cookware looks fantastic impressive weight and feel but that is where it ends everything sticks to this stuff no matter how low you set the heat source food sticks forget about frying an egg or anything else they stick horribly want to make fudge or other heat sensitive confections don't it will definitely burn i have several mix and match pieces of inexpensive stainless cookware and they all outperform this set i deeply regret this purchase teflon comes off within a year highly recommend yoshi blue skillet has held up better than anything loved the pan until it warped it now spins like a top on my smooth top stove and can't use it this item should be more clearly defined captioned and listed it is a saucepot and not the more frequently used and purchased stockpot there is a big difference in shape size and use the pan is the size i have have been looking for for a long time at the right price when i was using it i found the lid got very hot the hard way i touched it be warned i bought this pot from amazon in april it was a really nice pot except that after putting it in the dishwasher the rivets came out all cloudy milky looking trying to get a straight answer on why this was from cuisinart was an adventure they first suggested i just clean the rivets off by hand which would defeat the purpose of using the dishwasher for the pot then they suggested i send them the pot for a replacement if warranted but it would have been much more helpful if they could have just told me whether this is a 'feature' of the pots not safe for dishwasher use or if this was just one bad manufacturing batch i didn't have the patience to find out and just returned the pot it's too bad a qt pot from this line i bought in has been excellent included are three pictures one of the three shows rivets from a pot from this line the other show rivets from this pot after going thru the dishwasher for being stainless clad it won't work on a induction hot plate first of all i buy a lot of things from amazon but i almost never write any review because most of the stuff are pretty good and the ones are not so good are expected not to be but this one is different i bought it a few months back i like the pan well enough i used it twice in a month but without the rack but the rack is not good i put the entire thing in the checked in luggage in an one hour flight and when i opened it back home one of the handles of the rack was broken how come a stainless steel handle can come apart like that shoddy product and bad workmanship i can't return it now since it's too late at least i wanted them to replace the rack aluminum rivets react with stainless steel in solution water fairly rigorous reaction produces while buildup and frothy bubbles that float to the surface this can't be healthy i intend to return this product absolute crap warped so disappointed i researched and tried so hard to get a good set that would last a couple years this failed in all my categories handlesget hot the lids are not glass so you can't see through the quality of the steel is awful stains and scratches and burn marks totally disappointed i don't own this set yet however i'm looking at the reviews info from product description and info obtained by calling cuisinart customer care cusinart customer care said that both mpc and mpc n products are made with stainless steel for exterior and l for interior after some research l doesn't seem to be a standard grade of stainless steel it is more of the internal grades used by cusinart from q a postings from various websites cuisinart customers seem to all say that l contain less nickel than chromium nickel i put a neutral rating because i don't own it and just want to share some info with others from wiki page i extracted the phrase below decreasing nickel content and increasing manganese results in weak corrosion resistance this will explain the reason that lots of reviews complaining the stain and rust of the interior i'm debating if i should buy this set or not if someone has bought this set recently please post share your experience on the issue of rust and stain of the inside of the cookware i mostly care about the cooking surface i will appreciate that info very much i love the pan but it doesn't come with a cover having no cover limits what i can do with the pan if anyone knows where i can get a cover let me know high maintenance have to use special sponges to clean it and certain soaps to clean it nicely built but the nonstick finish scratched very easily and i used only non metallic kitchen tools it got so bad in several months that the pan had to be tossed out i was very excited to get this pan the pan was used the first time to make a roasted chicken on top a bed of potatoes celery carrots and onions the meal turned out beautifully but after washing the pan i noticed divits in several places on the bottom of the pan it also looked as if the finish was coming off similar to the look of an old mirror that needs to be re silvered i called customer service the first time and after giving all the numbers on the pan and box was told they did not make this roaster and referred me to some outlet online store why i do not know the cuisinart customer service rep made me feel like i was losing my mind even though i had the box and pan on the table in front of me i spoke with a person at the online shop just seeking confirmation that the pan did indeed exist and that the numbers i had were for a legitimate item they assured me i was not losing my mind so i placed a second call to customer service after being transferred around a bit and sitting on hold i finally spoke with a different representative who said yes they make this pan and would i please email pictures so they could review the claim to see if i qualified for a replacement pan i took pictures and cuisinart sent me a new pan upon opening the second box i inspected the pan and found the same issue quality control is sadly lacking you would have thought that someone would have opened the box to make sure the replacement pan did not have the same issue i decided not to go through the run around again because my time is worth something and sitting on hold and being transferred is not worth the money i spent on this pan what a pain the quality seemed very good it is a very nice set but literally everything sticks to these badly i am no unskilled cook and even with more than adequate greasing most things stick badly they do clean well afterwards but some things are just impossible to cook with these like eggs for example i have entirely given up cooking eggs in any fashion in these pans they stick terrible to the point of ruin i have numerous pieces of cuisinart multiclad pro cookware but this one is a disappointment mainly because heat is not distributed evenly food in the center burns before that on the periphery cooks not sure what the difference is in this pan compared to versions that are not nonstick but provide more even heat distribution this pan is great for dishes that contain liquid but for searing braising and browning forget it i always get multiclad pro because i cook exclusively on induction cooktops wish i could swap for a different pan be very diligent the dimensions say x x but the actual dimensions of cooking area are x x even the dimensions of tall are off an inch its only long including the handles immediate return might be a nice pan but i'll never know i bought a whole set of these pots and pans from qt up to and thru a qt pot i also bought their steamer basket as i steam alot of veg not at all happy since the saucepan i use with the steamer pitted after the very first time used only other thing is they feel and sound very cheap i suppose it's my own fault that i bought all these pieces with lids that aren't glass so you can't see inside without lifting the very hot lid can't return as i threw out every bit of box packing material and have been using them huge lesson stick with calphalon after months of use i'm disappointed that the bottom already no longer lies flat that shouldn't happen with a skillet at this price and this quality can't understand why i feel i should have spent the extra money and bought the all clad should have gotten a pan that the handle doesn't get hot but it cleaned up great when i creamated something in it made in china i really love this skillet but when i used it on a glass ceramic cooktop and i found the bottom is not quite flat i am very disappointed that this steamer does not have a stable design i purchased the multiclad quart pan to use with this steamer and the steamer circumference is wider than the pan making it top heavy and tipsy the steamer has tipped on me when simply pouring frozen peas in the steamer maybe the larger quart pan would be more stable if it has a wider circumference we got these as a wedding present i used a pot and a pan one time and ran them in the dishwasher when i took them out they were both rusted i've never seen anything like it luckily i hadn't even finished unpacking them from the boxes and amazon is going to take them back no problem so disappointing though my friends all chipped in to get us something really nice for the wedding and they were cheap junk my husband works in stainless steel and said they were having trouble with china flooding the market with cheap metal guess we know who is buying it bottom of the pan warped very badly after a few normal uses the pan would probably still work on a gas stove but it was unusable on our glass top electric stove returned for full credit including shipping the low rating has nothing to do with the quality of the cookware i didn't even use it the second i took the cookware out of the box and saw that it is not stainless i returned it immediately cuisinart cookware has not been stainless since and it's made in china i'm curious as to why the description states stainless there have been numerous complaints in the reviews yet amazon won't re word the description i would give zero stars if possible i opted for viking the made in the usa ply line more expensive but wonderful cookware they look beautiful and clean easily i did notice there seems to be some sort of weird calcium like build up around the screws pins that fasten the handles to the pots one thing i will caution though is the be careful of the edges i was washing one when it slipped around my hand and cut it wide open i was shocked about how deep and thick it cut my hand i've also cut my finger open another time when i was rinsing the pan and it barely slipped through my fingers i don't know why they don't smooth out the edges but now i wear rubber gloves while washing the pans and i try not to lift them if i do i only touch them by the handle i refuse to grip it in any other area because i'm afraid i'll cut myself again as much as i like them i'm going to start shopping for different pots pans because i've never had issues in the past with my kitchen wear trying to cut my hands off in the meantime they get me by for what i need horrible pots they always look stained very heavy and the lid handles burn your hand i would have returned them but i couldn't get them back in the box the same way they came out i own the other sizes in the multiclad and they perform flawlessly this pan warped within a week of use don't buy it this is the worst cooking product i have ever used in years of cooking every thing sticks to these pans i even contacted the company to get pointers on to best use their products even following their instructions every thing sticks right now i have a frying pan on its second day of soaking in my sink as soon as i can get this frying pan clean i intend to take the entire set of pieces and take them to the recycle center if they get ground up maybe they will finally be useful in another product do not buy this product unless you want to spend more time cleaning your pan than you do cooking in it bought this skillet in hope to save a few bucks vs a more premium brand unfortunately the quality did not hold up to my expectations the finishes are quite good and it feels like a solid made piece but already after my second time using it it warped i'm using a gas burner and was careful to not overheat the pan keeping it at low to medium but that did not help it still warped since i'm using gas it not a big deal other than the annoyance of it not being fully stable on the burners but if you are using a ceramic induction stove top i would not recommend you to buy this skillet spend a few more dollars and buy something with a better quality we bought these about a year ago to use on our flat top stove overall we have been pretty happy the stainless doesn't always clear up the easiest but usually does after using bar keepers friend which does tend to scratch the surface though however the saut pan has warped twice on us now the first time we got a replacement from cuisinart and it is now happening with the replacement which we have only used a dozen times or so we are careful to use medium heat and not use cold water after cooking so we are a little frustrated it would be fine to use on a gas stove but since we have the flattop it spins when cooking warped during first use i purchased this to match my induction set because i needed another mid size piece this is pitting with little brown iron spots on the inside this isn't happening with the full set just this piece i am not sure i trust how long it will hold up at first it seemed just like my older cusinart set but the handle was different slightly not enough to bother me what was a disappointment was after reheating some tomato sauce the two rivets holding than handle on were had lost their shinny appearance greatly and even noticeably pitted the rivets are not very durable i don't expect them to deteriorate to the point of ruining the pot but this should not have happened like this i debated about returning it but i have had it for sometime now and decided to just keep it something just not right with those rivets as the other larger pot has not done this after many times of cooking and heating up tomato sauce the pan was not flat as it rocked back and forth on a glass top range quality appeared good i've been tempted to throw it away twice because cleaning it takes longer than preparing food in it works fine with more liquid foods eggs will stick no matter how much butter oil is used initially i was impressed by the price and quality of this cookware and they sat perfectly flat and heated up nice and evenly however after a couple weeks i noticed that my skillets were warping to the point that they no longer sat flat on my ceramic cooktop and there was about mm of gap on one side of the pan when sitting on a flat surface i always used low heat and never put water on them while they were still hot i contacted cuisinart about getting a warranty replacement after the first skillet became warped the process was slow and a little frustrating and i was unimpressed that i had to mail them a check for shipping before they would send me a replacement after i noticed the second skillet beginning to warp i decided to return the set to amazon for a complete refund if using a gas range these may be just fine but if you have a ceramic cooktop i'd recommend getting something else unless you're not very picky about having perfectly flat bottoms on your cookware after doing some research i discovered that i was not the only person to experience this issue i didn't have any issues with the sauce pans warping food sticks to it really fast i was expecting for a non stick casserole oo hard to clean every thing sticks i have used this pan over about three months now in that time i've used it about four times i haven't treated it like fine china but i've been careful with it it has gone in and out of the oven and been soaked and scrubbed clean with a typical green scrubby sponge i have not piled pointy scratchy metal things into it in the sink and i haven't banged it around result after four maybe five uses there are significant scratches over the bottom of the pan the scratches aren't deep but they went right through the metal coating and rust is showing through them on the top interior surface the stainless coating has begun to chip showing the aluminum core inside just not acceptable i am going to try to get a refund from cuisinart because i don't want to have to wait for a replacement from them only to have it fail in another few uses i have had good luck with other pans from cuisinart so this is a disappointment particularly considering the poor quality of this pan is a known issue edit i tried contacting cuisinart directly to get a refund or replacement they said they don't handle that can't offer a refund or a replacement seriously heed the other bad reviews of this product and buy a different product this skillet has warped after less than months of light use doesn't lay flat on glass stop stove anymore i guess you get what you pay for i am so disappointed because i thought i finally found the best price for a good pot however after just first use i found out both inside rivets bolts which hold the handles rusted corroded that means they were not stainless steel i report it as defected item returned it i did not request for replacement because i found other people reported the exact same problem within this year a nice less expensive alternative to all clad the pan itself is fine although the build quality on the handle and lid is poor the lid doesn't fit well and the handle could be more substantial but the heat distribution is similar to the more expensive pot this is replacing so if you care more about cooking than looks this will fit the bill i am not as happy with this purchase as i thought i would have been the cookware does discolor more than i thought after every use i find myself having to go over it with barkeepers friend just to take out the discoloration that occurs very frequently if i had known this would be this much of a problem i would have purchased another type of cookware the things i do like are that the cookware is high quality and i love the curved lip for pouring liquid i can tell they are made well i just wish they were not so prone to discoloring my mother has a stainless steel cookware piece from emril and i rarely see that one discolor so i wonder why these ones do more often mine arrived today please see attached picture of markings that were present when i unpackaged the roaster disappointed i found these searching amazing for cookware sets made in the usa i didn't double check to make sure this was true areived in a made in china box we have the complete set of cuisinart multiclad pro cookware and ordered this as an addition to the set we really love the set however this product was not of the same quality all of the cookware in the set have stainless steel rivets holding the handles to the pans on this one the rivet was made of aluminum it corroded after one use beware do not buy anything from this seller you will just get worthless crap they won't let us return it this cookware does not work properly on an induction cooktop we have a new jenn aire induction cooktop and when power is turned on the cookware makes a buzzing sound from what i can research the triply construction vibrates with induction cooking it would be great for gas or regular electric cooking cusinart customer care says they are unaware of the problem the mcp n set is made in china while the cuisinart classic set is made in france and may or may not have the same problem when you are on the bleeding edge of newer technology you bleed i bought this pan january and used about times i always hand wash and dry after months the lid has either rust or corrosion on it it is also very thin the pan is a nice weight and the handle is also nice i also did not care the rivets not sure if they are stainless but thought they would rust or corrode after the nd use the finish appears to have worn off in several spots so disappointing fortunately i was able to return it to amazon for a full reimbursement this pan died almost immediately for the cost of the pan i was expecting much higher quality the non stick material started peeling off making the pan unusable i ordered the multi clad pro and returned the first one due to a quality control issue amazon was great and sent me a replacement right away when the replacement came it had the same issue there is a spot on the handle that is void of the shiny chrome and is bare steel this happened with the second one that i received also it came today and will be sent back tomorrow i have many cuisinart products i like them this is the first stainless pro skillet and i am sorry to say that i will be looking for another company for my next one these are supposed to be high quality skillets i'm very disappointed by the quality control it is made in china i have other multiclad products from cuisinart and am very disappointed with this pot the rivets on the interior are all corroded i used the pot twice i have written to cuisinart about this problem i am afraid to even use this pot now since i don't want all the corrosion to come off in my food update since posting my original review i have written to cuisinart about the corroded rivets my emails to them started on it has taken almost a month but they are replacing my pot they require a lot of information and pictures before they will honor the warranty they also required me to send them for postage which i really didn't think was fair but i did i haven't used the pot yet so hopefully the rivets will hold up in this one they did not give me any reason the rivets would have corroded in the first place if i use this pot and the rivets are okay i will change my starts originally i gave this star but i changed it to since they replaced it as soon as the base heats up the metal bends a bit and no longer lays flat against my induction cooktop perfect when out of the box warped after the first heating thought it was defective so ordered a second same problem after the first heating very difficult to clean i am disappointed in these as they discolor and stick so badly i know that this is not supposed to be a non stick set but we didn't expect things to stick this much they are very difficult to clean too thought these pans would be great based on the many positive reviews however this is not my personal experience the large quart pot was used to cook a homemade sauce in along with meatballs and sausages when it came time to clean the pot i did the same thing as the other pots i squirted some dawn dish soap in the pot spread it around the surface and filled it with hot water to soak when i emptied it and started cleaning the inside i discovered much to my dismay that the handle rivets inside the pot were no longer the bright shiny silver as it was and is on the rest of the pots instead the rivets are corroded course and a pale gray color and now its making everything stick to them such a shame because they came in a quick delivery no damage and looked so beautiful looks doesn't cut it for me its quality of the product that i concern myself most with and this does not stand up to my expectations doesn't really work very well i bought this with the dedicated quart saucepan by cuisinart but the fit between the steamer and the pot allows steam to escape rather than forcing it up through the steamer so most of the steam escapes before it gets to the food and things take longer to cook frankly those cheap supermarket flower petal stainless steamer trays that you put into the bottom of a saucepan with an inch of water work considerably better for most things i purchased this set based on the great reviews and description that said they are stainless steel i called cusinart to confirm they were after reading other reviews saying they were not cuisinart did confirm they were not but had no idea what type they are after a week they finally told me they are serious steel which is basically cheaper quality because they replace the nickel with magnesium and it's less expensive for them to make and makes the pans more likely to corrode amazon was apologetic and is replacing them with the cooks standard clad set buy a different set bought set of cuisinart model mcp stainless pots and pans and had issues with sticking and staining bought bar keepers friend from amazon and tried it tonight on skillet inside came clean like new so tried the outside to remove stains more stains and pitting resulted see photo recently bought a set of the cuisinart multiclad stainless pots and pans honestly the pots and pans are ok but nothing to get excited about i've found the pots and pans tend to stain very easily after a months i found pitting and staining on the bottom of my frying pan i seen people comment that all you have to do is use some cleaner to scrub the pans out that's all well and good but one should not have to do that its one of the reasons for buying stainless steel in the first place i previously had a missed matched set of hoffritz pots and pans with clad bottoms and thought i was stepping up with the cuisinarts sadly mistaken i would argue that the cheap o hoffritz pots and pans out perform the cuisinarts significantly the hoffritz pots and pans cleaned up better cooked more uniformly and i had less problems with food sticking than do with the cuisinarts as potential purchasers you need to be aware that the term stainless steel is a very general term the steel formulation will dictate the stain resistance of the product these pots and pans are made in china and the chinese made stainless steel products that i've purchased in the past have generally been a disappointment these pots an pans are following that trend knowing what i know now if i had to do it again i would not purchase these pots and pans i like the weight the cooking performance the dimensions and the price however this pan gets terrible spots of discoloration whenever i use it to boil water it could have something to do with my water but i use other stainless steel pots to boil water as well and none of them get spotty like this cuisinart that plus a friend's poor customer service experience with cuisinart have made me regret this purchase i am serious about my cooking and wanted something that would heat evenly and quickly work on an induction heater and remain good looking these pans do fine for the technical end but they discolor and stain very easily this particular saucepan became permanently discolored in the simple act of making rice to date i have found no way to recover the finish i returned this because the size was exaggerated i trusted cuisinart but marketing seems to thinks bigger sells better even if you lose time returning it later i actually read the reviews on amazon and saw some people were describing pitting and de lamination in a short period of time that never happens with traditionally laminated metals i bought a good guaranteed pan on chefscatalog pans are heavy cook evenly but rivets pitted after first use amazon was fantastic as usual may be great on gas or direct eye stove no good on glass top the quality is very good but i was hoping the lip of the saucepan will prevent spills when pouring directly from the pan out to another container this one does spill quite a lot i did a lot of research on roasting pans before buying this one and it was really hard to decide from the america's test kitchen favorite caphalon to all clad and many more i am completely dissatisfied with this product i had to return it right away when i got it the inside of the roasting pan had scratches like if you would clean it with a metal scrub another imperfection is the end where the clad finishes it wasn't cut or polish properly you can see part of the aluminum exposed because the outer stainless layer didn't cover it all the way also if you compare it with the cuisinart multiclad pans the thickness of the roasting pan is not even half of the size as the pots and pans another problem is that the bottom is not flat at all for induction owners this will be a huge problem because it will be dancing in the stove and the heat wouldn't transfer to the roasting pan defeating the purpose of its magnetic stainless steel finish i didn't want to cook with it because of the pitting that occurred to a lot of reviews so i returned it i'm adding pictures so everyone can see this and think if is a good idea to buy this roasting pan good luck with your research i reviewed stainless steel cookware for several months i went to a cooking site that rated this particular set best over quite a few higher priced name brand sets but after my wife used this set the beautiful silver came off like melted chocolate now she has a brand new set that looks and feel old after one usage i'm embarrassed because i thought i was getting such a great deal with the rating readings about this cuisinart mcp n multiclad pro stainless steel piece cookware set rated at a retail cost of about dollars i'm glad i didn't pay for this set not impressed handles get super hot and must be picked up with a pot holder wanted a set of cookware that would last me years i am already researching to purchase another set and throw these away after spending over on this set it's very unfortunate i read countless reviews and not one person mentioned this perhaps mine are defective tonight i used it the second time since christmas four pits in the metal already have appeared this is bad how many will appear after a couple of dozen uses defective manufacturing bought on one of them the bottom of the wire rack was not square one end to the other so the rack rocks a bit in the roaster pan a lack of attention to detail let me preface this by telling you i rarely write reviews if i wrote a thorough review about every item i purchased from amazon i'd be writing for a very long time if i write a review it's because i have a strong opinion about a product i really wanted this roasting pan to be the one my forever roasting pan the one that would last with proper care and would not need to be replaced for as long as i am upright and cooking my goal was to replace a kirkland roasting pan that had been in service for years there was nothing wrong with that roaster except the rack had begun to flake and rust rendering it the rack useless the pan itself had a non stick surface which was in good condition however i felt the need to replace it as i am using non stick surfaces less and less and prefer multi clad cookware after researching what was available i narrowed my options down to this pan and an all clad flared roaster ultimately i decided to purchase the cuisinart roaster as the majority of reviews were positive and it appeared to meet all of my needs while being a more reasonably priced item when the pan arrived i was excited to try it out yes i'm one of those people that get excited about cookware after a close inspection it seemed to be of good quality though there were already a few scratches on the interior and the rack was a bit thinner than i would have liked not ideal but if it performed well not a deal breaker either i used it the first time to roast a ham which turned out perfectly hammy i mean come on it's a ham and how good can it really be lol anyway while washing the pan i noticed that there were more scratches than before probably from the roasting rack moving around still not a big deal after washing there were some mineral deposits which were easy to remove however i also noticed a few spots that appeared to be pitting after trying to clean the pan again hoping these spots were not the dreaded pitting that i had read about in the negative reviews they were though i knew better i decided to try the pan again hoping that no more pitting would occur this time i roasted a turkey the pan did its job and the turkey was delicious though i had hoped to be able to make gravy in the roasting pan i decided against it as i didn't want to cause any additional scratches i was already babying it which defeated the purpose of buying this type of pan after washing there were more scratches again they seemed to come from the rack moving around in the pan scratches happen but i've never seen this extent of scratching from any of my other multi clad cookware after minimal use and of course even more pitting had occurred if you are familiar with pitting you know it is not the same as mineral deposits mineral deposits can discolor your cookware giving it a white spotted appearance but can be removed with a minimal amount of effort if you use the right product pitting however is what occurs when pieces of the finish erode causing a pock like appearance if you run your fingers over the areas in question you will be able to feel pits in the surface this obviously cannot be scrubbed away and can ultimately cause rust in the eroded areas i'm guessing that rust may not have a place on your menu after years of use and sometimes abuse none of my other multi clad cookware has shown any sign of scratching to the extent that this piece has after only uses and the pitting good grief i find the pitting absolutely unacceptable in my opinion this product is an embarrassment to the cuisinart name your experience with this product may be different than mine i don't know what you expect from your cookware you may be okay with a lot of scratches and pitting or maybe you just don't notice things like that maybe you don't plan on using this roaster very often so it doesn't bother you i planned on using this roaster at least once a week so i was very disappointed when it didn't perform as i anticipated as for me i'm sending the cuisinart back to amazon and will be visiting my favorite kitchen store i know i'll pay more there but i think i'll have a much better chance of finding the one i really like my cuisinart mpc n set i bought recently and i wanted to add a few larger items to my pantry unfortunately this pan warps after first use and could be spun in perfect circles i had replacements and all of them warped right in the middle after i heated them to medium high then turning off the stove this piece is also thinner than my mpc n don't buy this if you have ceramic stove top and don't want to end up with wobbling pan in many ways this pan set is very nice and i hope my rating is not unfair here are the things that bothered me first the pans are quite heavy not beyond the pale but definitely heavier than all clad for example in itself that might not be a big problem but the handles are essentially flat and highly polished the polish makes the handles somewhat slippery and the flatness doesn't allow a good grip i noticed this especially when tipping a pan to for example pour off the cooking water the handle design combined with the weight did not allow me to feel secure when handling the pans also the selection of pans included in the set was far from optimal sauce pans are one of the real workhorses of a pan set and everyone needs at least this set includes only which is not enough everyone needs one nonstick fry pan and this set includes none if a larger sauce pan were included in the set then the steamer pan would not be needed because an ordinary steamer basket would suffice and takes up lots less room in the cabinet the high sided saute pan is also a rarely needed item also like many high end pans with metal handles the handles are quite long the length makes the pans more problematic to fit in the dishwasher and more difficult to store i might also mention that fully triply pans like this make a difference when using a gas cooktop but if using an electric cooktop pans with only triply bottoms are essentially just as good as well as being lighter and less expensive i received this skillet and other cuisinart multiclad pro pans for christmas the sauce pans qt qt and qt are flawless the cooking experience is great just like america's test kitchen said sadly this skillet is a major disappointment first use it started flat i have a smooth top range and plan to upgrade soon to induction by the time the pan had heated up to cooking temperature it was like a rocking horse i am the cook of the house the wife can but doesn't i've been cooking since i was about years old i'm now and i know how to cook properly and care for my cookware so it's not a matter of negligence on my part i find myself in agreement with atk now and will be replacing this skillet with the all clad fyi the bottom of this skillet warped to a out heating teaspoon of olive oil to a shimmer fortunately the sauce pans have been problem free after almost two weeks of constant use i was planning to purchase the qt saute pan but after going over the reviews i see this pans suffers the same defect cuisinart really needs to correct this design flaw asap cooks with smooth cook tops are not going to be happy otherwise this is a small pan barely at its outside widest and it cooks too modestly not quick like the classic ss pan of an earlier design that just has an aluminum disc or something i was initially wowed by how much faster ss cooks than analon or even cast iron that was the appeal and it tasted better too because the food seared so quickly i didn't find the cleanup onerous yes it stuck some but no problem that was a previous generation of cuisinart with glass lids which i also loved and i guess a thick aluminum base but pur ss sides otherwise what a sear but not this baby i think they engineered it to cook evenly with a layer of aluminum all over the pan sandwiched by ss but it removed all the sass i'd rather have uneven but dynamic cooking than warm pudding cooking design and marketing strike again i'm going to get the series classic with glass lid which also is great for cooking fast and sealing flavor this one will go back and to boot it has oil stains on the sides that are hard to remove i didn't have that with the older pan i just used several times and the bottom of the pan began to be black it seems the metal parts has some bad stufff coming out just like my old one i was worring this stuff is harmful to health warning pan does not fit in a standard oven i might have given more stars if we could have used it i thought i had done a lot of research including size to fit most ovens my mother's double wall ovens are barely years old have sizes changed so much in that time i might also add the price was almost more weeks ago which is annoying to say the least one of the pots was grossly scared it will not come off it is mechanically scratched by a drill or the like everything sticks to the bottom even with oil in the pot i had to get nonstick to make eggs absolutely the worst cookware i have ever usdd when we followed the instructions for cooking on low and medium heat nothing cooked when we raised the heat a bit the bittoms were ruined can't get a refund beware this junk very heavy i ordered this pan for everyday roasting and also for the turkey this thanksgiving it is a well made sturdy pan it is also quite heavy which is why i only give it stars definitely required two people to lift safely with the turkey we roasted an lb turkey in it and the turkey fit just right any bigger and it would not have fit on the roasting rack we roasted our vegetables in the pan after and they turned out beautifully crisp i would recommend this pan but be cautious of it's weight as many people have mentioned this arrived damaged i was so excited to get it but it arrived with several deep scratches on the cooking surface and a general appearance of having been scrubbed with some sort of abrasive cleanser or cloth i don't know if it was used and being sold as new but it seems like an easily scuffed surface i ordered this waaaaay last minute got it the day before thanksgiving and really needed a pan to roast the turkey so i contacted amazon and they gave me a discount for the damages which mostly seem cosmetic i did not have any of the pitting or flaking off of the top layer during the roasting process my turkey came out perfectly but i don't know that the roaster really has anything to do with that since it was only acting as a drip pan essentially i was able to make perfect gravy in it though so i give it props for that nice flat surface no problems on the stove top i've got coils if anything what i need is a new stove so this seems to work fine but it seems overpriced for such a name brand product that has such quality control issues seems like cuisinart is relying on its name recognition and letting any effort to make a quality product go by the wayside i'll keep this and use it but i'm only satisfied but not happy with it because i got a bit of an extra discount in the price to do do over again i'd shop around for something better this could be lack of education on how to use this cookware but everything sticks to it even when plenty of oil is used it's a nightmare to clean i do not cook eggs in this cookware the first few eggs i attempted to cook ended up smeared across the bottom of the frying pan not a bad set the rivets inside have to be cleaned really well like most cheaper sets to keep bacteria down heat up pretty quick on a electric stove and no rust spots seen yet why does it say nonstick mine not only stick but are all black after a the first use i have some iron from le creuset and after years still look new product not as described pictured the skillet received didn't have the helper handle item was ordered from sotabletop it scratches food burns and sticks to pans these do the job in cooking but they were not the quality of stainless steel i expected i wanted to send them back but then i could not be bothered read other reviews if it seems too cheap to be true it probably is this pan was delivered weeks ago and after using it four times to reheat soup and heat water a small portion of the finish flaked off bottom inside i called cuisinart the response was that they were sorry if i wanted to ship the very heavy pan back to them at my expense they would refinish it so much for a lifetime warranty this skillet is not i repeat not dishwasher safe i have two and the non stick coating has begun peeling on both of them i would not recommend this to anyone who is looking for dishwasher safe non stick normally love this line but this pan seemed different food sticks burns easily and the pan was wobbly again have been very happy with the multiclad pans but this one doesn't seem to match up returned happy now with d made in usa allclad much better product i told you the set runs small in another review after checking capacity of the qt pot it is only quarts filled up to the brim it is actually more like quarts or less why do they have to lie and make them like that other pots have extra capacity over the actual contents same with the qt stockpot it is qts when filled right to the brim their qt pot fit totally inside my old qt pot i was excited to buy these pans based on other reviews but they aren't as spectacular as i expected i read all of the care instructions and am following them when i clean the pans unfortunately some of the pans have permanent burn looking stains in them or a texture change that just wont go away when even when i wash them they do look pretty from afar and get the job done my husband doesn't like them because you have to use a non citrus soap with them and it is better to hand wash rather than put them in the dishwasher this looks like an excellent saucepan the only problem is that it is not the dimensions stated in the description it is supposed to be wide at the base presumably but it is only wide not especially good for a wide gas burner like a blue star range i'm sorry to have to send it back cursinart mcp n multiclad pro stainless are a disappointment they are newly purchased a little over a month and used maybe two weeks these pots and pans scratch very easy they are not easy to clean i use pots and pans to cook i want a quality product that can withstand cooking pretty is nice but not my main objective in the kitchen i will return them and take a loss as my return period unfortunately has passed by a week better to forfeit now than be frustrated with poor quality items over the years if you like to cook these are not the pots and pans for you after contacting amazon com they were kind and generous to allow me to return the item without a charge it is a pleasure doing business with amazon com if there is a problem with an order i alway have a source for a live person who listens and is courteous small pitting showed up after just one wash i had read some reviews reflecting this but hoped for the best will return i thought these were great when i first bought them now after using them for more than year i find them ok just not great the large frying pan will not remain flat on the electric cooktop so i gave it to my daughter who has a gas stove it curved up just a little so the bottom of the pan was useless for my needs the smaller surface pans still work just fine but i miss having the large one i really wanted to love this set and have it as a replacement for my current set but i'm not loving it i'm not ready to discount the set as i think i need to improve on cooking with stainless steel but at this time my instinct is to move back to my other set i'll keep trying and will update again after i've given it more effort on my side update i never got the hang of these pots and pans ended up giving them away to a friend the rim is so sharp like knife i and my wife was hurt by the rims times already first the good things heavy thick walled nice handles cooks stuff really well cleans up easily great price i've returned three of these and kept one here's the history november the top of one side was dented badly enough that the top edge had a ripple this did not occur in shipping both the product box and shipping box were undamaged so it probably left the factory that way i sent it back for an exchange without making a close examination for additional flaws i did notice however that the rack had a really nice smooth matte finish december the replacement was a keeper sort of the bottom of the roaster is mostly flat but liquid tends to pool a bit about the sides unlike cuisnart's multiclad pots and pans which are completely flat on the bottom the pooling is not consistent so it's not clear if the pan is designed to have a channel or not either way the manufacturing is sloppy if you turn it over you can see that the bottom joins to the sides differently as you go around the pan some places there is a curve between the bottom and the side other places it's more than degrees so that a channel forms anyway it works fine for cooking gravy on a gas stove top but will not make contact everywhere on an electric glass top there have been no issues with flaking or pitting the rack is smooth matte and welds are reasonably well finished the rack handles are a bit crooked june the date of manufacture was stamped on the bottom causing a small bump up in the interior of the pan the previous pans did not have date stamps and cuisinart multiclad pots and pans are engraved rather than stamped as they should be what kind of moron damages a product by crudely stamping the date into it the pooling was more pronounced the rack had a cheap shiny look and rough surfaces throughout and the welds were poorly finished one of the rack handles was at an obvious angle i called cuisinart and asked if this was normal quality for this product okay dumb question the rep asked where i bought the pan and then transferred me to amazon customer service without another word shipped back to amazon for an exchange june the replacement had a stamped manufacture date again but the bottom was flatter and the rack was acceptable quality straight handles smooth surfaces okay welds now however there was something new several small streaks of powdery black gunk stuck to the interior of the pan looked like something left over from the manufacturing process cleaned it up and decided the pan was good enough to keep using the patented mark bittman minute turkey method i cooked a bird and it turned out perfectly well browned all over tender moist delicious but when i cleaned up i noticed that a diameter piece of the stainless surface had flaked off never figured out where that went but the pan went back to amazon at this point i have given up on cuisinart and am roasting stuff in cast iron pots and pans although that won't work for turkey amazon was great on the returns no arguments and no shipping charges this pan did not fit my standard oven even though i measured it before i purchased it the handles were too high disappointed because it was recommended as the best on google review photo was very misleading this pot is actually quite wide too wide and short to cook pasta oh well its went back meh i should have just gotten the cheap stuff at ikea these get those heat stains marks the sizes are a bit uneasy to use woud not recommend i don't usually write these reviews when i receiver the roaster all looked great seemed very heavy duty after using two times the clad is peeling off now it is too late to return the piece why would a company like cuisinart make something so awful it's cuisinart for goodness sake that is all i use i seen similar reviews but figured somebody did something wrong to make the pealing happen guess not i use them on a glass top range on medium to low heat with a spray oil and they still scorch the food also my wife find them to be very heavy and hard to wash first let me say that the set looks well made it's very heavy the handles are put on well i do like the longer handles which don't get hot when you cook i used a lid on a saucepan and it did get slightly warm so i think if you are using lids for extended periods the handles would likely get hot i am just starting my cooking journey with these pans i made pudding using a metal whisk which i only used gently and it did scratch the pot which rather upset me the pudding did come out nicely without sticking i would think you ought to be able to use a metal whisk and expect it wouldn't scratch there were absolutely no directions with the pots no warning about this tried fried potatoes in the frying pan i heated the pan a few minutes then put in some oil and a little butter bits of potato made a solid brown mass on the bottom of the pan pretty quickly and the potatoes never did brown or get crisp very disappointing the pan cleaned up pretty well considering the mess stuck on it i don't plan to put mine in the dishwasher as i think the soap for the machines is too harsh i did buy a can of the barkeepers friend as recommended by some viewers and it does a nice job i really hope things go better with these pots it took me a long time to decide on them i got tired of replacing non stick pots frequently and hated the risk of the surface coming off i will update my advice right now to anyone switching from non stick to ss is realize that they do cook differently i haven't tried eggs yet but the cooking instructor at cia recommends you actually buy a non stick pan for eggs and use it only for eggs so i just assume eggs might be a problem sticking update after using these pots for months i can say that i like the saucepans just fine they heat up nicely and quickly especially when boiling the frying pans i still don't like i have gone back to using non stick frying pans really disappointed about that tried to do french toast the other day and it was a horrible mess they stuck to the pan pretty much everything does i've made homemade pudding in the saucepan with no problem sauces etc never tried eggs in the frying pan since everything else stuck beware this pan warped upon nd use but is not returnable because it is after days i was careful to use only medium high heat what should be a normal heat for a skillet i bought a whole set and added several skillets but am sorry i do not recommend as cuisinart does not appear to be quality cookware my husband did all the research on this cookware it was worth the time and his effort this cookware heats eveny quickly and cleans up well this is a well made sauce pan however it has a significant design flaw that in my opinion a pan of this volume and weight should not have the problem is that this pan has no short handle opposite the maine handle this makes using the pan when full difficult to lift move and pour from this is particularly problematic when the contents are hot off the stove the weight of the pot and contents are heavy and the one slim handle makes it even trickier to cary while is seems very well made this shortcoming would keep me from purchasing it again has i the foresight to recognize this limitation prior to the first purchase never made it to where i was mailing to you guys took it back and i just got my money tied up for two weeks so how would you rate it i was expecting to get a pan with helper handle as shown in the picture that is not what i got sending this back i threw away several of my old nonstick pans in the hopes of finding affordable steel cookware without the toxic chemical surface i returned this set after finding that the cleanup job required was way more than i am willing to do there are other pots and pans out there mostly ceramic lined that are nontoxic and easy to use looked in the box and returned before using after the disappointment of the skillet purchased at the same i sent this back for the t fal this skillet is fine for a simple hamburger helper or spaghetti box dinner it doesnt heat evenly on gas range and the handle is weak there is no lid saut ed onions and mushrooms took longer then the t fal that is half the price i cook about times per week and these pans looked very good so i thought i needed a high priced set to compliment my style well after the first use they were stained and it won't come out i've tried a couple different things and it did not work so i stopped trying and just continue to use them because if you pay this much for them then they do not need to collect dust or be thrown away or given away i would not recommend unless you could get them for less than the listed price because then they would be about what you could get a decent set for at a regular store my wife and i purchased these with gift cards we received from our wedding disregarding the discoloration that was easily removable with bkf these performed wonderfully sure i didn't love the mirror finish but you can't argue with something that performs so well having said that weeks after the purchase they have been graciously accepted back by amazon as result of some of the pot interiors flaking off pitting wow also i called cuisinart to validate the amazon description of stainless steel no such luck i was told that unless it says on the actual piece no stainless is used i also experienced small rust spots keep in mind that i haven't ever put them in a dishwasher handwash and immediate drying only i wish cuisinart would step in and own up to the quality issues again beautifully made very functional wholly unreliable everything sticks to the pans while cooking every piece is stained on he inside with small marks neither vinegar nor bon ami gets rid of them although bon ami does get rid of the large areas of discoloration i will not boil detergent to get rid of the stains when good ventilation is required this does not sound safe and i doubt is a better solution than bon ami the pans and lids are beautifully constructed with a strong sturdy feel i have used the pans for about a month i would not recommend this product this steamer could might be dangerous to use it's so bad that i'm not even going to try to test it by trying to steam anything in it i was so excited and couldn't wait for delivery of this steamer but now i'm extremely disappointed that cuisinart didn't do a better job of fitting designing this steamer to their own cookware i put it on my quart saucepan and it immediately tipped over can't have that happening while cooking i tried turning it in all directions and it wobbles and tips no matter what i do can't seem to get a good solid fit it would be better with short helper handles on each side like my old double boiler for better balance not the one long handle but even then it would still be too loose and let steam escape around its sides i can't say just how unhappy i really am with cuisinart for trying to put one over on us with this obviously inferior piece of needs to be a tighter fit they made a mistake in trying to manufacture a universal steamer to fit all their saucepans my old copper bottom double boiler set from years ago has a much better fit as it should just wish this one did cuisinart should be ashamed for putting this on the market i don't know what more i can say would give this zero stars if i could before purchasing this steamer from amazon i even went to cuisinart's web site and looked up exactly which saucepans this universal steamer should fit and it should definitely fit the quart cuisinart multi clad pro saucepan that i recently purchased from amazon i've tried this steamer on all my non cuisinart saucepans and it wobbles and tips badly on all of them really i'm so unhappy with this purchase that i can't think of the right words to say just how badly i feel without using words that should be censored the only surface this pan is stable on is my granite counter top now i'm starting to wonder about the quality of the other cuisinart pans i recently purchased so far they all seem great and i've been very happy with them but i'm withholding reviews on those until i've had a chance to use them a little more update same day amazon is graciously refunding the money i spent i've even written to cuisinart about this i don't know how something like this made it through their quality control judging from other reviews this steamer just might have a bad defect but i'm afraid to take a chance and order another one i'm going to try to find another good steamer set of some type but i really did want a matching steamer for my already growing set of multiclad pro cookware i would have paid more for a steamer pot that was made especially for my saucepan even would have bought another size saucepan with a matching steamer one that really did fit well i hate that some products are being made one size fits all nowadays not doing justice to anything i just need a good steamer by next week when my daughter is visiting due to lack of cabinet space i gave away my old ancient one when i knew this one was on the way maybe i can borrow it back warning these pans are horrible everything sticks we have tried everything if you want to ruin your food and waste your time get these pans there is good news and bad news the good news is that this is a very inexpensive stainless steel cookware set that costs only a little more than a single covered pan made in the u s a if your budget is limited as mine is this is what you go with the bad news is the stainless steel is of poor quality not noticeable at first small pits began to appear in the skillets on the inside cooking surface they don't limit the cooking ability but they aren't pretty and our pots and pans hang above a center island and we want them to look nice these don't the smoothness of the metal is subpar and its hardness is lower than iron gauging from the scratches that were picked up i must assume from ordinary spoons and spatulas it appears the manufacture is either using poor quality steel or not using good quality control yes they look great when you first use them then after six months they look like something made in a third world country i bought an additional two quart pan that was plainly labeled made in the u s a and after several months of use it makes the other pans look crappy so i know what i'm talking about if you can save your money and buy one piece at a time and pay a small fortune for it by all means look for the usa label otherwise you get to look at pitted and scarred metal as i do and be disgusted with your decision finish inside pan flakes off one use a turkey at degrees hours three large pits inside pan poor quality update returned the original pan to cuisinart they sent a replacement clearly a used pan that had pitting also so returned it and they sent another badly pitted pan as a replacement their customer service people say that their is no one else i can talk to to get a non pitted pan and while they say they do have a corporate office they do not have a phone number for them truly unbelieveable now returning the third pan they also say that cuisinart does not do refunds it looked great out of the box and felt properly heavy for the purpose that it intended to fill the stainless steel surface appeared flawless both inside and out iv'e wanted a pan for some time that was thick enough to transfer heat well for use on electric stove top after roasting to make gravy from meat gravy this one won't due because after only one use a chip appeared in the bottom surface about a quarter inch across the only tool used in the process was a bamboo scraper for dislodging solids during deglazing with white wine if this continues the pan will become unusable after only few times i returned it for replacement in kind if the next one does the same i'll return it and swear off of cuisinart cooking implements in the future lee b i purchased this pan set cuisinart mcp n multiclad pro made in china but found it did not come with a small one quart sauce pan a size i use a lot so i purchased one from the cuisinart fct french classic tri ply stainless line instead it is so much better made the finish is beautiful the mcp line of pans made in china started to spot and streak immediately but the fct french made is still perfect they cost about more but well worth it for pans you will us e and love the look of for many years i cannot say yet how well each will holds up after many years of use as i have only had them a month but i am sure the french version is a better investment from the first time use to the things stick so badly you have to use scrubbing powder to remove it we were going to buy the hole set but wanted to try a pan out first to see how it is im happy we bought one and not the hole set as i don't like this pans inability to avoid a mess it does cook evenly and is a heavier pan not to mention when your done scrubbing it for minutes it does look shinny and pretty i wouldn't recommend this pan unless you love scrubbing things after the first use pan discolored trying to clean it left rainbow stain in pan took longer to clean pan than to cook the food purchased this pan separately from the complete set both in march by august my inch pan no longer would sit level on my glass cooktop stove i am very careful with my pans and never put a hot pan in cold water but somehow the pan warped and continued to get worse with time i called cuisinart and if i pay the shipping to nj from ca they will evaluate the pan and ship me a replacement i hope unlike someone else who evaluated this i do not have to include a check as i live in ca i guess there are some perks i love the pan but because of my glass cooktop i can no longer even get it to heat properly so sorry this happened don't know if this is a cuisinart design flaw but their customer service was very nice the pots sauce pans had issues the metal on the bottom flaked pitted the first time i used each of them i can't tell for sure but it looks like the inner layer of steel is very thin and has detached from the aluminum core in some places if it were just one of them it would be understandable lemons happen however in this case it was both sauce pans and the stockpot the issue doesn't seem to impact the useability but it sure makes them look ugly however the skillets are excellent as is the saute pan i could not be happier with them i was concerned about the handles getting hot but that has never been an issue the lid for the quart saute pan and the quart stock pot fits the inch skillet which can be useful for some cooking techniques i bought this set because i am trying to get away from using nonstick cookware but these pans stain super fast it looks like the metal oxidizes even when washed by hand i use all natural soap and i don't put them in the dishwasher but they still stain i prefer cast iron but i still have to use these for liquids when i received this pan it had a swirl pattern inside as if it had been used and washed a few times with something abrasive i got really busy with work and when i went to return it i found i'd missed the day return window i'd always thought amazon's was longer than that it might be a good pan but by ordering here you run the risk of having a used one shipped to you they are great but when cooking on my glass surface i did notice the outer bottom does get hotter than the center therefore it does not boil or cook fast you must prime these before use otherwise you will get discoloration the bolts inside pot shouldn't ever rust in a stainless pot so why did these after searching for a long time for a well made and reasonably priced stainless stock pot i bought this one for soups stocks and pasta so lots of hot boiling water it looks beautiful but if bolts rust into contents after only uses it's not for me nice weight and heavy duty but things seem to stick often and it takes more effort to clean than my cooks standard pots after a first use of q pot a layer of brushed shiny stainless steel peeled off in one place and revealed something black under it looks like a tiny pitting shaped as a heart approx size of inch and there are many strange rainbow color spots stains bigger than a black pitting also looks that a tiny part of a top layer of stainless steel might be disappearing peeling off and those spots stains cannot be washed cleaned looks like a first sign of pitting i used the pot the second time to reheat the soup and after cleaning the pot i counted deep and less deep pitting but ugly looking stains for now after a first use of q pot for cooking pasta there were stains and around the top inner side some black ring was created again looks that the tin layer of a brushed stainless steel probably disappeared and there is no way to clean it off to get a clean brushed stainless steel look back even some lids do not a have nice clean brushed stainless steel look but they have a blackish look maybe they brushed the stainless steel so much on bottom of lids and some pots around the inner top that there is left only an extra tin layer of stainless steel and it shows what's underneath who knows this cookware seems to be made of very inferior quality if after one use of a pot after one cooking of rice for minutes something like that happens even if cuisinart claims it is stainless steel probably the plant in china used for the production of these pots pans used some cheap knock off version of stainless steel probably that's why there is no any mentioning of stainless steel on the retail box for this set and none of pots pans is stamped as stainless steel on the bottom just stainless steel be aware that there is no mentioning about a stainless steel being used in this set on the cuisinart website stainless steel specifications appear only at amazon or newegg websites the cuisinart states stainless steel for professional use on its website what does it mean it is hard to believe that the pots are stained pitted blackened after one use mostly to boil water for pasta cook rice or to heat soup they even scratch easily inside when using bamboo utensils if a pot looks ugly with stains pitting that increase in amount after each cooking and it cannot be cleaned with a water and detergent what could i expect in a long run note the quality of this set is horrible and except amazon claiming that it is stainless steel there is no any confirmation of it on the cuisinart website a retail box or pots pans we have tramontina cookware pieces for almost years with a stamped stainless steel on the bottom of pots and they were used many times i never saw any peeling off of the top layer or black rings around the top similar to what i observed in cusinart q or q multiclad pots only pots i used from this set until now because i already hate idea of testing the remaining pots we also have a kitchen aid pot with a stamped stainless steel on the bottom of pot and we use it the exactly same way as these cuisinart pots cooking rice pasta re heating soup and i never experienced pitting in years and large amount of stains after first couple uses there is something really questionable about the quality of this set i would post the picture of q and q pots with all pitting stains if i know how to do it after using this pan times it warped it seems to be common for this product i is beautiful no doubt but the quality just isn't there and you don't want to deal with cuisinart support if you have to see below after i noticed it warped i could simply return it to amazon but called cuisinart to see the quality of support i can count on as i considered buying other products form cuisinart in the future they basically told me that i need to ship it to them pay for shipping include check for handling return shipping if they grant me a replacement it will arrive in few weeks few weeks cuisinart should learn customer service from lodge returned to amazon and bought all clad which i should have done in the first place this set surely looks nice and feels nice however after a few weeks of normal use i'm noticing a lot of stains i clean the pots with barkeeper's friend after using them but to no avail there's no amount of barkeeper's that will remove the stains if i'm supposed to treat those pots like cast iron i might as well buy a cast iron set as they're actually easier to clean than this i hate to do this but people need to be aware of this situation i read all of the reviews and was very excited to get this cookware set one of the main selling points is the steel if you look elsewhere at reviews for the similar product that is not steel they are pretty bad however i showed my husband the amazon reviews and we were sold the set arrived today and i was a little concerned that there was no advertisement for steel on the exterior of the cuisinart box when i opened it up and began to inspect the pots i noticed right away that they were simply labeled stainless steel i did some internet searches and was able to look at other cuisinart pots and pans paying special attention to the markins on the bottom the ones containing steel were plainly marked stainless steel we are going to return the set and try it again amazon is usually very good about customer service and it is entirely possible that some inferior sets end up getting shipped to their customers i will update the posting to reflect what we think of the correct product update second set still not but still looks great amazon should revise the ad only wish there were larger skillet and stock pot included in the set pot pan sizes are good for a couple but a bit small for a get together or larger family i like the look of the set and that it's stainless steel but everything sticks even when using fat the tops and handles get extremely hot so we're always having to use pot holders w o glass tops you can't see in the pot easily so you add to cooking time when checking good concept but unstable dangerous design to make it universal cuisinart designed multiple steps to fit into qt mcp pots unfortunately the design provides only surface to fit against the base pot compared to surface in other steamer inserts that i have been using for yrs the slightest bump will topple this steamer insert from the base pot the fit is also very sloppy compared to my other steamer inserts use with caution we purchased this roasting pan in july for use during the holidays when it arrived we didn't open the box for inspection we just put it in the pantry when we opened it for thanksgiving the inside of the roasting pan had a small nick in the finish the stainless is marred amazon will not take it as a return so now we have a pan that will not last forever it will last until the finish finally wears do not buy this product and if you do be sure to open the package and check it right away pos i got these for a gift for my mother in law she likes the heavy weight of them which are not nearly as heavy as my kitchen aid pans but for some reason cuisinart decided to make them brushed on the outside and shiny on the inside it drives her insane that the insides are getting scratched up from cleaning and she is so particular about using gentle products doing everything the right way etc i wish i had gotten her a set like mine instead and mine were a lot less expensive but she wanted the steamer and she also doesn't like glass lids the handles are quite ugly on the cuisinart compared to the kitchen aid in my opinion i really wanted this pan to work out i saw it reviewed by the test kitchen and it seemed like a decent price i was really hoping the quality issues noted in other reviews had been fixed they haven't been i used the pan one time to cook a turkey i gently hand washed it before using the first time we cooked the turkey everything about the pan seemed great i didn't make gravy so there was no wisking or using the pan on the burners when the turkey was done i dumped the contents and let it soak for about mins then wiped out with a soft cotton cloth by hand like i said i really wanted this pan to work out there were three obvious pitts in the steel that hadn't been there before cooking i can't imagine how poorly the pan performs under normal use like wisking gravy and dishwasher cleanings i had to return it poor attention to detail i am definitely disappointed it is not the great value i was hoping for the inside polished finish was horrible they really rushed through it in production and did not take the time to do it well the large flat areas are shiny but all the corners are very scratchy looking the only way i can describe it is that it looks as if someone cleaned it will coarse steel wool or a green scotch bright pad i would send it back but we're only a couple days from thanksgiving on the positive side it does seem sturdy and hopefully will hold up over time i think i'm just a non stick kinda girl these were beautiful at first but if you're anything like me and would rather just stick these in the dishwasher after they've cooled you'll find that you need to use elbow grease first to have them come out sparkling at least the outside of the pots pans are still pretty i was suspicious when the package arrived and nowhere on the box did it say the pan was stainless steel nor did it say it on the bottom of the pan cuisinart's website had no info about it either so i called their customer service sure enough the rep told me that unless there is an symbol on the bottom of the pan it is not but is he said there is no way to know when you buy their cookware if you are getting the or because it is not advertised on the outside of the box anywhere he said some have it some don't and you won't know until you open it up and look at the bottom of the pan what he claims there is no difference in quality between the two and that is why they don't advertise it so when you buy any of these products from amazon you won't know if you're getting until you open the box i am highly disappointed in cuisinart from the small amount of research i did it seems that the absence of nickel in the makes it much more likely to rust and possibly less durable amazon however is great as always in providing a refund for this item update i replaced this with cooks standard multi ply clad stainless steel piece cookware set this set is only costs and the handles are much more comfortable i have a ceramic top stove that requires flat bottom cook wear to properly conduct the heat this pan was dead flat when i got it but after one use stir frying some vegetables it developed a slight convex bow in the bottom which was quite enough to cause uneven heating i have one of these from a few years ago and was hoping to replace it with my smooth electric range i need a heavy pan with a very flat bottom that will not bow the pan i received was not in the same league as my old pan new is cheap feeling and does not have a plate on the bottom have returned the pan thank you amazon will continue the search i purchased two in and one in the bottoms of all three pans are not flat but rather concave up about in on a ceramic top stove this results in uneven heating while others have complained that the construction of the handle is flimsy having been changed from what was previously used i don't agree the shape has been changed somewhat but it is still quite substantial and good looking update january the non stick coating on one of the in pans has started to peel off in a continuous sheet this is not the usual nick or scratch one would expect but rather the coating has become un bonded from the base metal over an area of about in by in if possible i will upload pictures of the defect with regard to the concave up bottoms i find that uneven heating on my ceramic cook top is not a significant issue the non flatness however is an annoyance when saut ing because the oil runs to edges leaving the center dry update april within a few weeks of my jan update the second pan's non stick coating also began to peel off in california warranty returns can be made to any of the product's retail dealers but i could not find a cuisinart dealer in my area that stocked these pans and none of them would offer a refund i contacted cuisinart and they said to ship them the pans along with each for their inspection and if they deemed the pans to be defective they would be replaced since both pans failed in the same mode and after such a short period of use i decided to not throw good money after bad i threw them in the garbage the cuisinart multiclad pro is a much heavier pot than the cuisinart classic the classic series of the cuisiart line is also superb quality but easier to handle than the ultra heavy multiclad pro returned this not worth the i have saucepans from the same line and they are wonderful i think you can get the same quality for much less at a discount or big box store i am giving ti stars because the saucepans in this line are a great value too bad the saute pans are not the lid handle rusted the first time and only time i put it in the dishwasher cuisinart was less than helpful when i called them luckily it was a easy return through amazon my wife recently used her friends allclad and liked it so we had to upgrade but i refuse to spend that much and the reviews for the cuisinart were every bit as good as the allclad i mainly do breakfast at my house eggs of any kind stick well oiled olive oil potatoes stick we immediately went back to using an old non stick pan for breakfast potatoes we did ground turkey for tacos last night and while most of it comes off there's still a small layer that sticks on there the dishwasher doesn't get it all off so it requires hard hand scrubbing i am building arm strength but i wish i would have just bought some non stick cheaper pans with the expectation of replacing them every two years or so i was torn when i made this purchase because i love all clad i did some research and found this to be quality worthy of purchasing i needed two double boilers because i was making several kinds of chocolate truffles and coating them in chocolate and did not want to spend the another ish on a second all clad i tried using a metal bowl and it worked but it was a pain not having a handle so i decided that i would buy one all clad and one cuisinart double boilers ish perhaps i missed this in the description or it wasn't listed but this double boiler does not have a flat bottom the bottom is rounded honestly this is illogical a double boiler is typically for melting chocolate the microwave is not the same when melting chocolate and you cannot make ganache in the microwave point is when the chocolate has melted the double boiler is not only pulled off the flame it is also pulled off the pot of water it is nestled on or you chance scorching the chocolate or blooming the chocolate once it has cooled i was disappointed that i could not set this directly on the counter i had to have an additional cold pot to set this in i was also inconvenienced by this this double boiler is a complete pain in the booty there are too may groves to accommodate multiple size pots and melting chocolate gets into these grooves no matter how careful you are this makes melting chocolate quite the chore and had me frustrated if that wasn't bad enough cleaning all the chocolate filled grooves is painstaking yes you can soak the pot but you will still have to get a sponge in the grooves to wash all of the chocolate out it was not worth the money i saved verses purchasing a second all clad double boiler because of all the inconveniences with this cuisinart the majority of the time i opted to use the all clad over this one which was another inconvenience because the whole point of purchasing two double boilers with multiple truffles in the making was to obtain convenience i would not recommend this double boiler for melting chocolate unless you do not mind all of the problems i mentioned however although chances are mega slim i will ever melt chocolate in this double boiler i will use it for cheese fondue that needs to stay on the heat my sister had a cookware set that cleaned so easily and beautifully i thought it was this set so i purchased it immediately i have only had this pot and pan set for two months and two of my pans are already ruined it seems to be when i cook with oil and it gets on the side of the pan it discolors and won't wash off even with stainless steel cleaner polisher with two pans ruined in two months i project having to replace the whole set within a few more months not worth it for the price i would never recommend this pot and pan set to anyone i ordered this back in november for thanksgiving the pan i received had some scratching in the interior when i received it where the stainless steel plating had chipped off you could see black underneath not sure what process they are using for their try ply but it needs work i was pleased with the size weight and other features of the pan including the stainless rack i thought i could get past the scratch inside as it was rather small but after using the rack for roasting our turkey when i cleaned up the pan i noticed the rack left loads of scratched plating where you could see through to the black underneath just like the original scratch this was after once use also there was some very small pock marks pitting i had no choice but to use it for thanksgiving and then send it back i have since had pitting problems with my other cuisinart multi clad pots i own these problems did not show up at first but took around months of almost daily use to show i suspect most people writing reviews here either aren't looking very closely for pitting and scratching or write their laudatory reviews after one or two uses sadly i cannot recommend any of the multi clad line due to these problems it's a shame because i love everything else about the product bought this set for myself on mother's day the set arrived about one week earlier than the amazon specified delivery date i shipped it overseas the set is very beautiful and heavy the first time i used it inch skillet the food got stuck a bit but it's because i wasn't very good at using stainless steel to cook i actually started to learn how to deglaze my sautee pan and so on and it's been great experimenting and learning new recipes i also made small omelets for my year old son with the inch skillet and they do not stick to the pan at all note heat the skillet first then add some butter and heat it then add the eggs cooks beautifully cleaning is very easy and fast i wash with warm water and soap with a wash cloth nothing abrasive then towel dry there are some mineral spots the water in my area is quite mineral heavy but it's a minor issue i do not use barkeepers friend so far i've not had any reason to do so i'll update my review after i use the set for a while update after week of use i'm reducing the rating by one star because the set scratches so easily i don't use any metal utensils just wooden and plastic spatulas and i can see scratches all over some of the pots and pans i can't decide what i want to do about it yet a part of me wants to return but another part of me wonders if the replacement set will scratch easily as well update after weeks i have no choice but to return this set i can't believe the pots are pitted after only a couple of uses mostly to boil water or to heat cream based soup i have no idea if it's normal or not i always used medium or low heat w the set i'm very disappointed cuisinart cs was not helpful i'll buy a set from a different maker i ordered this pan and it arrived with the bottom of the inside surface scratched so i returned it for a replacement amazon made the process very easy thanks amazon however the second pan all arrived scratched this time with the side of the inside surface being scratched i have not used the pan at all so my review is based on the fact that it seems pretty easy to scratch it since shipping it seems to have resulted in scratching i would guess that actual use would result in a lot more scratching i am trying another brand now if you already have a set of pots and pans in stainless steel this is an affordable way to add a double boiler to your kitchen collection without adding two new pieces the only draw back is that is will not sit in your drawer or cupboard without being placed on top of the pot the bottom is curved and thus it falls over if left by itself if i was buying a new set of pots and pans i would buy the double boiler as part of the set but since i already had a full set of cook ware this was a satisfactory addition and not found in retail stores i think the steel is cheap i have other stainless cookware and they don't tarnish like this one if i don't want this to tarnish i have to clean the inside with a green pad and dry it with a towel also the sandwich which is supposed to distribute heat evenly doesn't seem to work very well maybe it's too thin cheap materials anyway the pan has a hot ring and a colder center as a result of my gas cooker and that doesn't exist with aluminum cookware it just seem harder to find quality products at reasonable prices i didn't realize this pot had a rounded bottom to it which makes if difficult to store this should have been made clear in the advertisement before i bought it i was all set to buy this set until i found out it is manufactured in china i cannot understand why we undermine our economy by sending jobs and money to china i will wait until i can afford all clad and buy a american made product then i know i am not contributing to the destruction of our economy and country just to save money think people what you are doing on the pro side this is a perfectly serviceable set of cookware they do do what they are supposed to do that being said here are a few things to consider a mirror finish on any set of cookware that's going to be used regularly is to put it simply a stupid idea i shrugged it off and am now continuously annoyed the sizing of the stuff included in this set is like many sets of pots and pans a little off it's functional but less than ideal for a family the inch skillet is too small to cook much of anything in except maybe the occasional breakfast for one but it's stainless steel so no one in their right mind would cook eggs or other potentially sticky food in it when they could just use cast iron or non stick the incher is better and suitable for lots of stuff but again i find that i almost always prefer a inch for most of my cooking for two adults and two kids so it's just enough but not ideal the stock pot is a bit too big and the sauce pans a bit too small to comfortably make most of the standard things the average family makes a package of pasta a decent sized but not enormous batch of soup again i'm annoyed nearly every time i want to use these for future reference i'll look a lot more closely at the sizing and try to find local examples before buying online i love amazon but this particular purchase didn't work out very well i had to send the first one back because it had a strange rust stain on the upper inside of the pot the next pot had scratches on the bottom and the lid i used it once to steam some veggies with just water no salt and there were pits in the metal on the bottom of the pot after i washed it strange i never use any metal utensils so im not sure how this happened there was also this silicone like substance that was left along the bottom when it dried filler for the pits maybe it seems like these pots that are sold as new are possibly refurbished i would not purchase online again i thought i read that this fits into any multi clad pot but i don't know which one it's not universal in that one has to have the right size pot it looks well made but until i find the pot that fits this it's useless i really wanted to like this pan the three ply construction sounds great it looks like a very serious cooking tool with the brushed stainless exterior unfortunately the execution on this pan leaves much to be desired my first use of the new pan was cooking some pasta from watching the water come up to temperature i could tell the pan had excellent heat dispersion there were virtually no hot spots from the gas flame cleaning the pan after cooking the pasta i noticed what looked like spots where something had stuck to the bottom of the pan i scrubbed a little harder and still they wouldn't come out upon closer inspection i realized it wasn't stuck on pasta but several spots where the inner layer of stainless steel had flaked away i know virtually nothing of metallurgy but that inner layer of stainless looks awfully thin to me and it clearly hasn't been properly adhered to the aluminum core if it flakes off after simply boiling water in the pan i notified amazon of the defect and they immediately sent out a replacement i used the new pan to again cook some pasta first use and the stainless inner layer begins to flake one defective pan might be a fluke two defective pans in a row and i have to think cuisinart has a serious design or manufacturing defect personally i think they've scrimped too much on the stainless steel making the inner layer way too thin i do know i've had two pans fail on the very first use under far less than strenuous conditions if the pan can't boil water under a medium flame without literally falling apart there's a serious issue i've posted photos of both pans so you can see for yourself what i'm talking about in both cases there is significant discoloration of the stainless surrounding the spots that have flaked off a couple of the spots are about diameter you'll probably have to zoom the photos but the bad spots should be easy to see if you're looking for cookware that looks attractive hanging in your kitchen this might be your ticket if you want something that will last for decades i'd keep on looking this is nice heavy pot and is a good value but it does make excessive noise with an induction cooktop a little research revealed that this a common problem with cheaper clad cookware don't think it really hurts anything it's just annoying i have been wanting some quality stainless steel cookware for a long time read all the positive reviews here and decided this cusinart set was the best value for the money i purchased the set back in mid i do like some features such as the tapered edges the weight the look when the set was new and the even heating but i mainly bought because i wanted quality stainless shortly after getting and using the set i started noticing stains on the stainless steel since then they have gotten worse the quality of the stainless steel used for these pots and pans is horrible my old set of cheap single thick stainless with plastic handles given to us at our wedding over years ago is better at not staining than this set every single piece of this cookware has stains on it some worse than others they look terrible hanging on the pot rack and the stains will not scrub off i thought spending close to for the set i would get better results i can't afford to replace the set with more expensive stainless so i guess it's back to the cheap stuff for me i'm not a chef but we cook meal each day for a family of these pans are good quality heavy duty and look nice they are almost one hundred dollar less at costco btw but in order to cook things like hash browns you have to use so much oil to prevent sticking that it almost isn't worth having to add all the extra calories they also proved to be a pain to clean after doing starchy foods or meats we ended up returning them for a set of kirkland anodized aluminum cookware and we are very very happy with those i bought this assuming i was buying a european made product it isn't and that's why i'm giving it stars at this price point they could easily have made it in france updated within a week of first using it rust has begun to develop on the outside on the satin finish there was a very very small amount of water left on it after washing and it's rusting badly at that spot to me this indicates a very cheap steel none of my other pots rust including older multi clad pro and all clad this is a bummer original review stars i am amazed at the quality of the cuisinart multiclad pro stainless it may even be heavier than my all clad ply plus the cuisinart has the curved edge around the rim that all clad just started to include on their new products it makes the pot stronger and also eliminates drips when pouring the cuisinart has a brushed stainless finish on the exterior that keeps it from getting scratched unlike the all clad original the quart stock pot does not have a disc on the bottom it's just three layers of metal on the bottom and all the way up the sides much like my all clad d quart casserole the shape also is more like a casserole than my other stock pots that have high walls the cuisinart walls are a little lower and it's a little wider which makes it perfect to hold a pound chicken in my other stock pots the chicken only would fit legs up meaning it hit the sides during cooking the shape of the cuisinart also makes it perfect for braising meats in the oven i did not experience any hot spots using it on a gas range the lid is a little lighter than the all clad lids both are single ply stainless with a handle the handles on the pots for both the cuisinart and my all clad have rivets meaning the rivets are visible on the inside of the pot instead of being tack welded i know this bothers some people but i've never had a problem cleaning either pot i found the handles for the cuisinart more comfortable than on my all clad pots because the cuisinart handles bow out allowing my hands to stay slightly further away from the pot a few millimeters the all clad d handles bow in slightly towards the pot i don't know the difference between the mcp the older cuisinart and the mcp n this product because i haven't used older multiclad stock pot if you don't mind paying x as much and you don't mind the heavier weight the all clad d brushed stock pot is the clear winner however the cuisinart is every bit as good as the new all clad ply and better than the original all clad and it's x less money in my mind this is the best deal around bottom of pan not flat and not good for glass top stove i never put any heat on the pan i needed a new roaster and decided to go with the multiclad after doing a lot of research it seemed like a good option and when it arrived i was impressed with its design and heft it's definitely sturdy enough for stovetop use and the handles were great everything seemed wonderful but then i used it after cooking one turkey i was washing the roaster and noticed several places on the inside cooking surface where the stainless steel had flaked off i own a lot of stainless steel cookware so i know the drill no salt and hand washing yet that didn't stop this thing from pitting like crazy even worse there were big chunks missing from different areas of the roaster which was much more disheartening than just some little black spots i've never seen this happen before i'm perplexed because the item seemed to be a good quality product i guess not i am beyond disappointed i thought i was investing in a roaster that would serve us for years to come but it couldn't even make it through one use it took tries to get a pan that wasn't heavily scratched or gouged in the interior floor and used looking this last pan is not great a scratch on the front and the corners have visible bends where the multi layers were joined at the factory since the last one arrived days before thanksgiving i was stuck it seems to roast evenly it's ultimate purpose and the handles are well placed for handling i haven't used it on top of the stove yet so can't rate that not one of my better purchases could almost hear my grandmother tell me you get what you pay for i am not a professional product rater which so often appears to be what shows up on amazon just a regular customer the roaster is well constructed and held up well in my cooking which was to cut up a turkey lay it on a bed of aromatic vegetables and roast it it cleans up nicely which is always a plus it is not a small roaster but you need this size to truly hold a turkey and due to the size is a bit hard to wash but again so far cleans up nicely my current concern is a small chip in the bottom of the pan which i did not notice before cooking but could have been there and how that will affect the use of the roaster over time for someone looking for a good heavy duty probably should last a long time roaster this should be good i loved these pans when they arrived great weight an good handle design however with regular use they scratch and discolor so easily that i feel like i have to baby them this is not my first stainless steel cookware set and i know how to use and care for them if you try to clean or polish these with bon ami or bar keepers it causes scratching and swirling placing in the oven will leave a copper patina color of course the guarantee does not cover staining discoloration or scratching i do not expect cooking pans to be showpieces but i am disappointed that the finish is so delicate the pan is beautiful and cuisinart products are great but the roaster won't fit in my oven because the handles curve outward thereby you really need wide oven to fit this pan i'll be returning mine and making note of handles in the picutre of others didn't work doesn't work no benefit seen amazon send it to me quickly but im almost done with the product and all ive seen is growth with my nails did not help finished a box with no results at all my hair is still very thin useless i gave it stars because i am just starting to use it i had ordered this about a year ago when it came i saw that it had niacin in it i have rosacea and niacin really causes rosacea to act up so i sent it back unopened fast forward to a year later and now i have decided that it is much easer to cover up a red face than a bald head so i have just started using it i will post again in months to let you know the outcome on the hair and the face i sure hope it works yes i should have read the ingredients before i bought it i had a bad reaction from it i got a recommendation from my hairstylist to try this i was very excited to see what it would do i used it for days i had a very bad reaction to what i can guess was to the niacin after a couple days of taking it my face and head were constantly tingly i decided maybe it was too strong to only take one pill a day but i was still tingly then after the th day i took it at pm and at am my heart started racing at almost bpm and i couldn t sleep i called my doc and she said to quit taking it i still felt tingly on my face and head for a couple days after i quit taking it i did return and got a full refund cnnot tell ant difference in my hair maybe i should use longer have used for months helped my hair growth but affected my vision dramatically mercury in shark cartilage can be toxic to nerve cells i am discontinuing the treatment the side effects for this are terrible i had horrible shooting breast pain chest pain very enlarged and swollen breast took me weeks to figure out that the pain was a side effect from this it states on the package and website that these were side effects however i did not read until a month after i started taking it i would stay away from this didn t work for me i started losing more hair after starting within a week and broke out on my face i stopped taking no difference seen after a number of months saving my money supplements don't really work for hair health no difference in hair after using it still not seeing the results they claim will see i am taking it already for about months so we'll see this is a fake product do not buy it i bought a caposule pack and received a capsule pack that had each capsule package cut from probably a sheet i am on my st month just ordered the nd did take pictures beforw i started and will post more after months i have not noticed any side effects i had a allergic reaction after days broke out in hives and a rash stopped the product and everything cleared up have to check how to return as there is no receipt in the box ever from amazon don't think it works i had to get a refund made me break out so bad nope just get biotin i use the whole system and really like the way my hair is looking running out of pills very soon need to reorder for my second month i can't see any evidence that this is working this didn t work i gave it away keep your money this product did nothing for my hair in fact i lost more with the product than without it can't give negative stars won't post without a star bought this as subscribe and save and it's old stock has expired coupons not sure of the quality control so it may be better to buy from a physical store did not help me at all i eventually threw away the product i have bought this before on amazon and it is a great product but this most recent purchase seems to be counterfeit it is like taking a sugar pill immediate allergic reaction but no allergy to any listed ingredients i wish i would have read more reviews i do believe this is a counterfeit product don t know about this box this box is different and the pill is half the thickness why is this i ve bought from this place before and this is not the same product as before so until this is answered i guess i will leave a star just doesn t make sense i can say it does help with shedding but it did not fill in my thinning crown and i brought the month supply fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake i have been taking these vitamins for about a year and these are absolutely not them i was suspicious when i saw the box was taped up opened them and compared them to viviscal i have purchased straight from viviscal returning them and warning people not to order these because who the heck knows what is actually in these things so scary do not purchase gave it a year and it seems my hair is worse did absolutely nothing save your money and try something else absolutely useless i didn't notice any changes despite taking this for months whilst i do see a difference in my hair i see a big difference in my waistline too i have gained at least lbs since taking viviscal all in the middle and i could not figure out what was happening if you google the product it does talk about weight gain i am going to have to stop unfortunately that is not worth it to me made me gain weight sorry bought day supply and completed it as instructed noticed no different what so ever another product that took my haven't noticed any difference package nearly empty i have been using the product for months and have seen little growth my real disappointment is that the coupons that came with each box are always expired so i never get money off i didn't find much difference after using this product i purchased this item twice hoping to see some positive results my hair got worst it is totally gone in the top i had very thin hair in the top but now i can not grip it at all i would not recommend this product it did not work for me at all if you're allergic to shellfish this product is dangerous i looked at the ingredients and thought i would be fine even after i realized that my random continuous and even painful reactions were due to this i still endured issues i have the supplements were fine the est e lauder lipstick was terrible it did not last all day the color disappeared and faded and it was entirely too expensive would never buy it again just finished days still trying it out if it works takes a while i believe after using times i had a horrible stomach ache i don't like anything about the product at all never seen a difference at all it was all a joke i am very upset i spent money for something that never worked didn't do what i expected pretty much the worst thing i ve ever taken it does all the things i hate gives me horrible acne made me smell like rotting fish costs me tons of money i took this days and it basically ruined my life in that time also i read way too late that this is counterfeit i m not sure if what i got is real or not but it s horryifying do not buy this horrible product i ve been using this crap for almost a year about months in my hair started falling out massive amounts i also had severe scalp pain and irritation the pain was unbearable at times unfortunately i realized too late that the problem was viviscal doctor after doctor couldnt help me it s been a living hell and i can t believe this product is allowed to be sold i urge you not to use this product i lost my hair volume and it s been one of the worst things i ve ever been through i m just sick about the whole ordeal and mad at myself for not realizing what the problem was sooner snake oil no improvement whatsoever with these nutrient tablets definite stomach upset with these pills and i usually tolerate medications very well no history of gi issues after having read many viviscal reviews i thought i would give it a try well i can now move on without wondering what if that would have worked it didn't no effect doesn t work rip off i have used it for months and my hairdresser said my hair keeps getting thinner and the individual hairs are thinner in diameter on top of that the auto delivery is supposed to be every days and i always receive it too early when i have at least a week s worth left very disasatisfied with both the product and the vendor after days my hair felt indescribably soft my husband was shocked when he felt my hair i was shocked too unless i did something different that day but i don t think so i feel more elasticity since then after days i saw no new growth yet that s a bummer as i have bald spots from illness i still have hope i will rebuy because of the price point but i hate the fishy taste and i hate that it s made from shark there is another brand can t think of the name not made from shark but it s way more expensive i ll keep dealing with these but i literally dread swallowing this pill everyday i didn't see a change in my hair after using this for months they are not the same and the taste is different the one on the left is from amazon and the other one is from viviscal directly didn t work for me this product is making my facial hair grow faster have not notice growth as of yet on my head has not been a month yet as far so good did absolutely nothing for my hair my hair actually got shorter zero effect gained lbs and most reviews do say weight gain is a side effect the one i got was made in usa took pill for only days made me itch all over and get hives very painful one scratch on my skin and started to itch everywhere and get hives terrible reaction reaction lasted a week i read the ingredients and i m not allergic to any i don t know why i had this reaction will not buy again made no difference i usually don t right negative reviews but this product gave me false hope i tried this product for about months i did not notice any change in my thin spot nothing at all weeks after taking liquid biotin i have substantial regrowth therefore it was the ineffective product and not my hair issue that made this product not work for me don t believe the hype didn't do anything at all also sharks are killed to make these i know it did improve my nails my actual hair grow but did not help my spaced scalp that got lost out thanks i've seen no change in my hair loss not breakage but very bad shedding and loss i was hoping to see a change i'm a year old woman that has always had thick hair could be hormonal a little disappointed though last thing i want to do is start wearing wigs to cover up my thinning hair there was an initial reduction in the amount of hair falling however by the sixth month hair loss continued unchecked absolutely no regrowth of hair expensive disappointment i always buy this product all of the time but not from this seller i bought two sets and it is nothing like the original the pill is thinner lighter and smells different my hair is falling out all over again do not buy this buyer beware actual product varies from product purchased directly from the manufacturer i would not recommend this product do not buy this product it s not the real one havent seen much growth yet but we will see completely useless it didn t help with maintains or thickening my hair waste of money and that s the only change i saw despite the great reviews on this product it did not work for me at all to be fair it may have been because i am anemic having said this i still give it starts because it does thicken your hair don t know if it worked cause it made me nauseous i tried taking with food and different times thinning of hair slowed but have not taken long enough to determine if better hair growth i used the whole pack and got no results i think i have deeper health issues than pills can help awful hair was worse than ever taking this i regret purchasing and religiously taking these for months the taste is terrible not simply bad but gag inducing my body saying don't put this in your mouth type of bad i kept taking because the review claimed it's working but then i checked fakespot com and realized the positive reviews especially with photos are fake made my hair fall out i do recommend this product you will need patience at days maybe you may notice a little change at days there is some regrowth mainly fuz there is no longer heavy hair loss now at plus days it was so subtle the bald areas at my temple have filled in did nothing to improve my hair and i used for months maybe my digestive system couldn't assimilate it i really tried to like these but i couldn't stay silent from the hair loss if i could give it stars i would i started this with hopes that it would work just as well as expensive quai brand but within a week of religiously taking it i started losing gobs of hair in the shower and every time i brushed i thought at first it was due to stress from having the flu and missing some days at work two weeks in even my husband commented that i was shedding more all over the house even after getting better i thought it might be my body just getting used to these i researched and found some women saying it affected them the same but it got better so i continued the packet of pills three weeks in my hair was more brittle dry and the ends were splitting i went for a hair cut and my stylist commented on the change within a few months i have been trying to grow my hair for the last year and been religiously taking care of it this product reversed all the good growth i had please do not buy this product on the nd day had extreme stomach cramps and vomiting for over hours would never take again saw some reviews of stomach cramping but never would have thought it could be that bad impossible to tell if this worked no results after months did not help my hair one bit don t but it can not see any difference viviscal really strengthens your hair i would recommend this product to anyone who is having a problem with thinning hair or shrinkage and i have i am very satisfied with viviscal not sure yet i have tried multiple hair growth vitamins and this was not effective i felt no differance it deosn't work with me such waste of money i try to finish the last ones used as directed for several months saw no positive benefits to continue spending money on it better off taking a good omega multi biotin eating well and exercising i'm not sure if it's working i took only one pill and my skin started breaking out doesnt work at all and tastes like fish absolutely nothing happened i'm so disappointed starting to think all the nice reviews are paid wish amazon checks on that i think it happens for many other items i noticed that i started growing hair on my lip and above eye brows after about a month use of this product had to stop noticed no difference after months of eating my money on my second purchase in the hopes of regrowing my thinning hair due to stress and anxiety have not seen any good results honestly someone had said they noticed a difference after a week i finished package and i don't see any difference at all i've been taking viviscal for years with great results after buying a pack from this seller and noticing after taking about half of the pills that i was starting to lose more hair than usual i just went out and bought a new pack from an authorized retailer the pills look very different real viviscal pills are twice as thick as these even the blister packs look different when you compare them side by side though this fraudulent seller has clearly worked hard to reproduce the lettering and embossed serial number these fake pills also have a sweet smell which real viviscal pills definitely do not have i have no idea what's in these pills and i'm throwing them out right away they definitely do not work as described and in fact could be toxic i ve been using it for over two years see my before pictures and after does absolutely nothing does not work just use biotin it is the main ingredient in this and much cheaper but seeing any hair growth and i can possibly be damaging my health with the extra iron it did not work for my wife but who knows for others it may i dont know if this product worked for others but for me i kept feeling sick kept feeling that i was going to puke and had a strange feeling after taking them this was another fail for me been trying to find something to help the thinning on the top of my hair guess i will have to look for a th product to try and see if it works without making me sick thought it was t o help regrow the hair been taking over month and very little results i really wanted this product to work for me as i have really thin fine hair but unfortunately i had to stop after months of taking it i had used biotin keratin a few months ago and saw good results specially on my nails but unfortunately i had to stop that one too because it was giving me vaginal yeast like symptoms i stopped it and all my symptoms went away i decided to purchase the viviscal as i couldn t use the other one anymore and few weeks into using viviscal only noticed my hair was extremely dry and stringy and same yeast like symptoms i tried as much time as i could but after seeing no results at all on my hair and really uncomfortable side effects i had to stop so if you are very sensitive and prone to side effects this is not a good product i took only pill day for weeks to start with and thank goodness i had tiny breakouts itchiness on the back of my legs and constipation that lasted a week after i stopped taking the pills i noticed nothing different with my hair i know they say that you need to try this for months to see the full effects but i am on my th box and have seen no results i have now spent a lot of money on this product and it has not done anything for me i have been patient but i cannot justify buying another boxes to see if all of a sudden i will see some results after this long i should have seen some sort of results i am very disappointed and cannot recommend this product my investment is well over so far and i will not pay for any more i used the pills along with shampoo and conditioner and serum for days started seeing hair thickening and new hair loved the product i ordered more boxes of vitamins but i started getting very sick at my stomach i stopped the vitamins stomach got better started taking them again stomach pain and nauseous returned i tried taking them with food but they still made me very sick i tried to return but it said they are non returnable i've never had a reaction to vitains making me sick like that good product but foil doesn't stick and pills falling i have been wondering why i'm gaining weight i admit these vitamins are good for the hair but i'm realizing i'm not losing weight at all and i've been trying a long time as a matter of fact until i started talking these vitamins i have gained probably pounds and look fat all over i'm through with them but don't see any difference after i took vitamins i became so sick i had to go to the er i tried this product for over a six month period to see if it would improve my hair growth my hair follicles are sensitive to hormones and so i've been experiencing mild to moderate hair loss for almost a decade now i did not see the dark thick hair growth many claim to have experienced however it did not make my hair loss worse so that was a plus the vitamins in it are probably an added benefit there is a lot of iron but it wasn't enough to constipate me as iron tends to do a hairdresser i trust recommended i take prenatal vitamins and biotin as a similar and cheaper supplementation overall i would not recommend this to anyone suffering from androgenic alopecia and hoping to stop the hair fall i would recommend this for someone willing to experiment with supplements to re grow hair broke out and saw didn't see any growth doesn't work for me probably because my hair loss is hereditary doesn't work do not buy beware these are fake viviscal pills do work pretty well however buy them at a pharmacy the pills i received were fake the packaging look and feel was completely off this product has not given me the results that is proposed if you take it i have been taking it for a least months and can not tell any difference in my hair i would like to cancel all other shipments at first it seem t work great it did however it dried out my hair and took away all the shine i had made my hair dull and tangles horribly i felt it wasn't worth the poof it gave my hair which it did without shine and massive tangling disappointed they use artificial orange flavor why does a swallow tablet need artificial flavor the taste is really bad i have been taking this for years i do not want to give up taking these pills just in case i may see an improvement along the way is starting to work after mos you have to be patient i also purchased viviscal count from a seller on amazon which turned out to be fake i noticed the packaging looked somewhat different and the pills tasted different also my hair which had started to grow back fell out again within two weeks of taking the new stuff be careful purchasing this stuff online what a waste of been on this product for months now i can't say my problem is better but at least it not any worse will try to stick with it for the recommended months and see i took this for a few months i liked rogaine much better i finishe my first pack i did not see any difference at all i hope they refund the money cause it comes with money back guarantee these used to be great but the most recent shipment i got is definitely not the same product the pills are thinner and the ingredients on the back are slightly different they also taste different i found no real results from the latest shipment so have decided to start buying them from wallgreens or cvs instead based on the significant drop in stars from this seller used to be i don't think i am the only one that has had this experience after chemo and radiation i lost some of my hair but not all i used this in hopes my hair might grow back stronger and faster its growing back but at a normal pace and thinness and i honestly can't say this helped at all as it was starting to grow back when i took it that said i have heard from others that it worked well for them it may just be me and my body tried it for one year no visible results took as directed rogain seems more effective very unhappy with this and want my money back made me so bloated and caused weight gain no thanks no difference at all i was very disappointed i have been taking these for months and it has done nothing for me and i am concerned that amazon has sold me counterfeit product the packaging and pills look different than the ones sold in drug stores and rather than seeing growth in my hair i have noticed a ton of breakage and shedding over the past few months it's to the point that i feel embarrassed about my hairline as it is thin and frizzy because the hairs are so short on top of that i just made the connection after reading other reviews that explains why i have gained lbs in months despite dieting and exercising regularly i have also noticed bloating and changes to my menstrual cycle that started shortly after beginning taking these pills and now i'm extremely concerned about what i have been ingesting i have wasted over on these pills and i am not happy please don't make the same mistake i did item sold was a fake received product which contained calcium when the original doesnt tablet package container was worn most where already opened with bad seal tablets where smaller than original please do not buy these are fake only god knows what they actually put in these pills for human consumption pills began turning black after a few days of opening also when compared to another pack i bought from a store these had no batch code and other stuff were very different from the original these are counterfeit pills they are likely manufactured without any oversight the pills are different size than the actual the backing is different the ingredients i cannot believe that amazon continues to offer these products even though customers repeatedly state these are counterfeit this product is fake it's unacceptable i'm trying to return it but amazon is not allowing me too it smelled tasted and even looked different to the original one they are flat and smell like oranges for some odd reason this is my second day taking them when i realized i should see if people have the similar issue and yup they should take this seller off the site it was a waste of time and lots of money i reordered several times so i gave it months and months of a trial no good for me and there was no sign that it would ever work don't know my hair dresser says she sees a difference in my hair i do notice my hair grows faster but as far as any signs of filling in very thin areas i don't see any change i've been using vivisical daily for about five months and will continue to use it for several more months to see if there's a real difference for me i used this product twice a day as recommended i am yrs old with fine hair and i never had an issue with hair loss i wanted to try this product to grow thicker hair after exactly week i noticed my hair was falling when i took shower it became worse each day but i was still determined to finish the month supply i got horrible back acne and my face and scalp became oily i did not change my diet and i am not on any kind of hormonal pill it was a disaster at the end of this month i lost so much hair yesterday that the shower was clogged i paid for this sh i dont understand how this pill could have so many side effects when they claim it's non hormonal and all natural i just want everyone to see that this magic pill is not working for everybody i wish i knew it before i really hope my hair will get back to normal and i will never ever touch this product again i am scared to ever experiment with these types of pills ever again in my life stay away save your hair and money gave me serious migraines i wouldn't recommend to anyone i stop taking them after days because the headache from day day turned into a migraine and i had to call off work i would suggest trying another route other than this one may work for some but didn't work for me not to mention i wasted plus dollars on this product because i can't get my money back have been taking the pills daily and have noticed no difference in my hair growth now i notice that the box of tablets i received last month are different from the previous box the same as other reviewers have noticed given that the products we received are counterfeit i recommend to anyone considering ordering through amazon to not do so it is a waste of money bought for my daughter some people can develop migraines if already susceptible to them she stopped taking them and the migraines stopped something to be be aware of if you should start to get them and are prone to them i've purchased this product before and absolutely loved it saw huge results this is not the same product and i'm thoroughly upset about that viviscal the actual product is amazing and i highly recommend it order it from them directly though love you amazon and you know it but you need to get this lined out terrible product it made my hair fall i believe it's a counterfeit product be sure to count your pills before the return window closes i bought months supply of these and the last box i opened only had tablets not as advertised of course it's too late to return but i probably won't buy from this seller again buyer beware honestly i was only able to use this product for days because it made me feel so bad i was so swollen and bloated and i drink plenty of water with pills and throughout the day my joints felt tight my abdomen was distended and my back and hips ached terribly i stopped taking it and days later i felt fine i assume if i'd had the nerve to weigh myself that i'd gained weight but as a nearly pre menopausal person already on hormone therapy and feeling weight gain i didn't even go there i also noticed it made my face especially my nose much oilier and shiner which is manageable but unpleasant can't attest to whether it helps hair or not because i simply couldn't tolerate it back to the drawing board not sure if i'm seeing a significant difference after packs smells fishy as well i was using this for approx mos auto order but did not see any improvement stopped taking the pills and my short hair began to fall out at a rate that scared me back to using more to follow i'm not sure whats in this stuff cause its causing a lot of migraines terrible migraines that last all day i've also experienced dizziness and nausea i think its probably best to just take the natural road and leave this stuff alone i wish i could return it i contacted the company twice was assured i would receive a return call with an answer to my question asking what specific form of calcium was being used int his product some forms of calcium are easily absorbed like calcium citrate and others are not of high quality and do not provide quality calcium but are less expensive to include like calcium carbonate chalk the response i received from the company the first time was its the type of calcium that naturally occurs whatever that means the second time i contacted the company by phone i did not get any response given the company refuses to inform consumers such as myself what specific form of calcium is in their product i am sceptical it is a form the body can readily absorb i've only used it for days and don't see any new hair growth i'm willing to try another days didn't work at all over priced misleading labeling spend less on the high end pharma like packaging so the product can be offered at a lower price wife on account used for two years never missed a pill and never saw any change in my hair at all a complete waste of money i used the last of my stash up about months ago and haven't had any big hair fall either so i conclude that this just doesn't work on me or it's a complete scam am not yet sure if it is making a difference gives you acne well my hair was thin in the beginning and i thought taking this would really help thicken it out and obviously grow where i am a little more thinner it did not what it did do was make my hair even more thinner i am not sure who these woman are that they have on the official viviscal website but well it did not work for me at all i have been taking for months and i have not seen any difference after going using it for three months not cheap to do i got nothing out of it i need to add however that i have a daughter who has been using it and is experiencing new hair growth i have seen it for myself i have been using this product for months now although the product states that it takes months to see results i feel like my hair was growing faster and seemed thicker around the roots after the first couple months but unfortunately i haven't noticed any further thickness or additional growth and am starting to wonder if i was imagining it i'm going to continue using it for a whole year before i make a decision my hair is thin to begin with and colo treated so i need all the help i can get these don't work for me at all pass this product mysteriously made me gain weight i have no idea if it's the special marine ingredients but i could not longer use this product it was very strange that a hair supplement would do that i do not believe the item being sold here is the authentic viviscal extra strength pill i read the reviews before purchasing which questioned the authenticity of this product but chose to ignore it since the vendor was viviscal big mistake while packaging may change and the items with older packaging are commonly reduced in price i do not believe this is the same product as what is sold from other vivscal retailers first after taking this product for weeks i saw no change in hair loss second after taking this product for weeks i developed a horribly dry rashy scalp it was unbearably dry flaky and itchy i decided to stop taking viviscal my scalp eventually recovered believing this product not to be the real deal i purchased it at target for the packing is almost exactly the same but as mentioned in a previous review the lot numbers are different amazon viviscal is alpha numerical and targets in just numerical the pill packaging is different which could fall under the packaging my vary description the biggest and most disturbing difference is in the pill itself the pills from target which is a verified viviscal retailer are denser a totally different color and have a grainier look to it this made me wonder what did i buy from amazon the pills look and smell different despite the supplement facts being exactly the same i have no idea what i was ingesting believing it to be viviscal and i would strongly recommend that no one buys this from amazon target might be a little bit more but it is worth it for an authentic product that does not potentially give you an awful reaction hair did stop shedding but it appeared to be getting thinner i stopped taking them and my hair still is not shedding and its getting thicker i dont think these pills were for me i'll stick to hairfinity on those my hair grew longer and thicker these also have a sardine taste hair feels a little more coarse and seem to see less hair in brush have been using for months but no drastic change i was unable to take the vitamins for long due to stomach and digestion issues developed not sure if the ingredients are related to shellfish allergies or not unsatisfied due to no refund was allowed so i am stuck with a product that i cannot use and that made me ill i started gaining weight taking these supplements so i have discontinued them sorry it didn't work for me expensive product also not the same i question the authenticity i'm partway through my sixth month of viviscal i was impressed at first but it only reduced my hair loss for about the first two months i took it my hair is back to falling out just as badly as it always has i lose hairs a day dermatologists have no answers for me pantogar didn't do much either time to try rogaine i guess didn't notice significant hair growth improvement but it also didn't make my hair fall out i'll stick with the target brand hair skin and nails vitamin which actually works better for me and only costs for pills just another snake oil product that should only be allowed to be sold with a large type disclaimer i read the reviews about weight gain was hoping that they weren't true or happen to be a coincidence no joke i gained lbs within a month or two and i was just extra hungry and went on the scale afterwards and couldn't believe it i was eating more so i'm not sure if these pills stimulate appetite i stopped them and i was hoping to see the benefits of the hair growth but for me i couldn't gain that much more weight come on the biggest scam around i got suckered into buying these and have taken them regularly for almost a year zero difference beware elevated liver enzymes i'm a yr old woman and tried this supplement to possibly get a little more length to my hair i didn't think much about it and read great reviews of results so figured why not i went to my primary for routine annual bloodwork and he called saying my liver enzymes were extremely elevated i am otherwise very healthy and athletic drink little alcohol the only thing that had changed was taking this supplement he said to stop taking it and we will repeat the bloodwork in a few months low and behold my levels were back to normal so just a word of caution to all you women who want super long hair without extensions like me and think it's harmless to try this think again nothing is worth potential permanent damage to your liver after researching i think it could be the niacin but am not certain regardless if you are taking this please at least get bloodwork done to ensure your levels are where they need to be xoxo did nothing complete waste of money ok no noticeable improvement this item contains shark as an ingredient despite the fact that it is not listed as one of the ingredients above on the amazon page i've uploaded a photograph of the back of the box so that people can see what it has listed for themselves unsure about how to rate this product the tablet looks completely different than the viviscal extra strength that i have purchased at walgreens and other retail stores i have been taking viviscal for a year now and this tablet looks totally different this tablet is much smaller and a much lighter color i am concerned that it is not actually viviscal extra strength item goes out of stock often very unstable price product effectiveness differs from batch to batch it initially stopped hair fall but plateaus after few months the recent batch purchased for looks different n can absolutely feel no difference in teh hair it's shedding a lot also it smells quite bad fish smell may not repurchase i had such high hopes for this product after months there is no change in my hair i was especially excited when some reviewers noticed their eyelashes had thickened and even hair growth in their eyebrows not me i definitely would not recommend this product unfortunately these made me terribly sick to my stomach i've had that issue with other shark and krill supplements very disappointing the product did not work for me i used it for six months i guess everyone else is either seeing things or i have really stubborn hair but i followed this religiously for packets worth and i saw zero point zero results i have a small balding part hony upper left temple and it looks as thin as ever and these pills have a weird smell regerts i mean regrets sigh too early to see results t worthless a total waste of good money not sure if the product works since i haven't taken it less than a month so that remains to be seen the pills stink a bit like shellfish threw out after days the first several days there were no side affects days after taking it i had a racing heart and tremors for about hours straight i've never reacted to suppliments this way i thought i may have to go to the hospital not worth it still waiting to see if she avoids further hair loss these are not extra strength the listing is inaccurate i've purchased tons of products from amazon and have never written a review i actually bought my viviscal from walgreens but if i can help one person then it's worth writing a review i've only taken vivisval for four days but immediately on the first night i couldn't fall asleep each night i layed in bed until to o'clock in the morning i took one pill at a m each day plus i got two huge acne breakouts and when i run my hand through my hair more falls out than ever hefore do not use i've been using this product for about a year and have seen no results i used it for so long because i didn't want to give up on the idea it would work it just doesn't this product is intended to strengthen your hair not make it grow despite the photos shown doesn't work waste of my money i used for a month didn't see any difference i'm not sure what to feel about this product i have been using for months and haven't really noticed any difference hard to tell it takes time i guess i have taking it for two months no result they use for six month which i will hoping to see some results after reading the ingredients i can just double up on the supplements i already take i wasn't aware when i bought this as they likely do not want it advertised but this product contains shark cartilage i will certainly not be buying from this company again have been using it for month seems like it helped with a hair growth but the same time i notice a lot more shedding not only in the shower but when i brush my hair after the shower a lot more is falling out i am going to stop taking this pills and see if it was related or not i purchased these after i noticed my hair thinning due to a lot of stress i did not take these long enough to notice if they worked however please note if you do plan to buy these there is a fishy taste within two weeks i had a bad break out of cystic acne on my chin and acne in my hair line needless to say i stopped taking them didn't get what i hoped out of this maybe because i didn't take it long enough my hair started falling out in clumps after months of taking viviscal it started coming out a little more than usual and i thought it would get better after taking it longer but it continued to get worse so i stopped taking it hair skin nail works just as well and is much cheaper been on them months only nails grew interesting dilemma with this product the first box i got was great i know it worked for a few reasons first the results were unmistakable i had a bald spot and the hair started growing back in my hair grew an inch in one month second i have this medication that i have to take every night that makes me nauseous however when i started taking this along with it i didn't get nauseous anymore i believe the reason is that this supplement technically has food in it says it contains shark and if i eat certain high protein foods with this medication like a hard boiled egg then my likelihood of getting sick goes down dramatically however the next box and the next box came and the color of the tablet was different my hair hasn't grown as quickly some of the hair that i did grow back fell out and i have been getting nauseous when i take my medication again to me the evidence is pretty clear that this vendor has failed ethics and that's pretty terrible did not work in fact it hurt my hair i took this product at the advice of a dermatologist after using it for about weeks i saw thickening in my hair but after routine woodwork my physician called to say i had elevated liver enzymes and after a fibroscan i now know i have liver damage the only change in my supplements was viviscal on my nd month and seeing not much growth not worth it in my opinion i really really wanted this product to work for me but i had to stop using it because it made me break out in stubborn cystic acne that took weeks to clear up might be just fine for someone else but be aware that you might experience acne by using this product i took viviscal for a little over a week and within the first couple days of taking it i developed intense abdominal discomfort and cramping i brushed this aside and thought it might be menstrual cycle related however then i started having diarrhea tmi i know and my arms and legs got extremely itchy to the point where i was just in so much pain needless to say i discontinued using the product even though my hair did feel thicker within the week plus that i took it i am unsure if i received an unauthentic product or if i am just allergic to some of the sketchy ingredients in the supplement shark cartilage horsetail extract etc i would be extremely cautious when taking these pills and listen to your body closely to see if you are having an adverse reaction worst product ever have been battling an unusual severe case of acne for the past months i just figured out that it was viviscal so i immediately stopped taking it guess what acne problem totally disappeared but not without leaving an extensive amount of damage to my skin because of scarring i am yo with absolutely no history of acne what so ever which is why my sudden outbreak was emotionally taxing and disturbing i didn't imagine that it was viviscal because people were telling me it was hormonal even seen a dermatologist for the first time in my life and they prescribed hormonal meds however something was telling me that it wasn't that it had to be some sort of change that caused it so after many months of fighting this issue and becoming withdrawn and depressed i read the reviews and noticed that i had the exact same bad side affects as many others and stopped taking these vitamins my breakouts stopped days later and now i'm hoping to find a way to heal the scars emotional and physical wish i could go back in time to when my skin was scar free there are other odd symptoms i experienced along with acne brain fog insomnia social anxiety rapid aging eye wrinkles thinning skin dark under eye circles and weight gain i'm a size naturally fit also work out times a week noticed an increase of stubborn fat around my belly arms and thighs that has been difficult to remove fyi i bought my first month supply through viviscal and second months from amazon the issue occurred after a month of taking it so i would say that regardless of where you purchase the product it will more than likely have the same affect since my issue started during the supply i received from the manufacturer buyer beware update have not had a menstrual cycle in mos so my estrogen is out of whack and for a very fit woman that workout times a week my muscles are servery atrophy so my skin is flabby and hanging from my bones my face is still drooping too i've always looked yrs younger and now i'm looking much much older very recognizable depressing and extremely embarrassing because people are probably wondering if i've fallen ill or is on drugs i'm hoping that my body will go back to normal but i'm not so sure being that i'm older and i don't really know how much damage to my ovaries have been done i've worked very hard over the years to stay fit trim beautiful skin and emotionally stable taking viviscal took my appearance mental strength and happiness away within a few months and for god knows how long it takes for me to recover if ever trying to stay optimistic but because of all the side effects i'm kind of skeptical of getting back to normal i already still have ugly scars on my face from the acne that i've been able to cover up with makeup but this body issue is still lingering because my hormones are still wacky i've never prayed for a menstrual cycle to come more than i now do everyday still nothing yet just slight feelings of menstrual cramps as if it's going to come but nothing ever produces remaining hopeful though do not i repeat do not risk your health for extra strands of hair it didn't even work that well for my hair i know i'm going on and on but this is strictly to benefit you and not have you go through what i'm going through so here's another thing rob kardashian is was a spokesperson for this brand which is one of the reasons i gave it a try well please google his name with viviscal and watch his appearance on a morning show promoting this product pay close attention to his appearance how bubbly and optimistic he sounded the whole bit then look at him today broke broken spirit mentally unstable in my opinion depressed and very overweight is there a connection sounds like my symptoms only that he doesn't have a uterus so he can't complain about not having a menstrual cycle i never rant or write reviews but this time i had to and will continue to update this review as i make progress hopefully so i can help others who may be going through the same thing right now after about weeks of discontinued use of viviscal i am in my first week of taking pure organic wheatgrass juice to detox and get rid of any heavy metals that may have been in the shark within viviscal and i just started taking estrotone to aid in getting my menstrual cycle back on track along with with other multi vitamins i work out daily but nothing is working with rebuilding my muscle mass which is why i'm so very scared right now that this may not be reversible but again i'm not giving up hope it may take just as long for me to feel normal again as it has taken for me to realize this is what has been contaminating me body around months i pray it doesn't take that long i hope viviscal doesn't read this and think about sending goons after me but in case they do i've already set up a protective circle around me lol i'm really serious but what they can send is a check with a lot of zeros behind a healthy number for all of the pain suffering and mental stress that i'm going through have been in great shape until now can't even believe this is happening have not seen much difference viviscal provides a temporary improvement while you are taking the supplements to hair condition and some growth but nothing as dramatic as i would have hoped for the price i have been taking the pills once daily regularly for years i took this for about months definitely noticed that my hair wasn't falling out as much which i definitely appreciated but it didn't help with hair growth at all i already take an extra biotin pill and prenatal vitamins and it didn't help at all unfortunately i recommend this for hair loss but not hair growth did nothing for me never try again give chest pain didn't work for me have not used it bc the side effects include insomnia i have been using viviscal for over seven months and have not seen a difference at all i'm very disappointed i am and my hair has gradually been thinning i thought this was the answer but apparently not i think it is working i'm still loosing hair but not as badly as i had been i'm hopeful that by the time i've used up my box i ordered i will see and feel a definite difference i have used this for over a year and there has been no changer in my hair i just kept hoping will stop using it it was helpful works in the two to three weeks i was taking it not all consistently my thinning eyebrows started to grow back i did see faster hair growth however once i started on a strict regimen of twice daily pills after about a week i developed severe insomnia and anxiety had to discontinue use sleep returned to normal after days i will now be trying a regular multi with iron in it and then maybe a collagen supplement and biotin my hair thinning seemed to be due to stress and maybe poor diet i will say customer service with this company is good after reading reviews about authenticity i emailed them with the lot number of my product and expiration date and they were able to verify that my batch was genuine the shark ingredient is controversial but i read on a blog that someone emailed the company they claimed it is harvested from a non endangered species of shark that the cartilage is not from the fin is a by product of the fishing process also that the mercury is filtered out take that as you will but i do believe it may be something in the aminomar that caused my side effects as the other ingredients in the pill are relatively harmless something in the pull seems to mess with your hormones my thoughts are that you should give the product a try because it did work for hair growth however be very very vigilant about side effects don't wait weeks to notice you can't sleep or that your hair is falling out my hair has been falling out more since i've been using this product bad side effects if i could have given this no stars i would have after two weeks of taking this supplement i noticed an increase in shedding i thought it was normal because i know that most growth aids cause the hair to shed a bit more the shedding had only gotten worse after taking it for weeks in total the shedding was enough to cause an alarm please note that i have never had any problems with shedding in the past apart from normal daily shed hairs not to mention after taking viviscal my menstrual cramps were even more intense i purchased three boxes because i was convinced that it would work well my mom takes it currently and she has seen subtle improvement in the health of her hair with healthy hair care practices she has been taking viviscal for five months now it has been weeks since i have stopped and the shedding has decreased a bit but i still have a long way to go my hair has thinned out considerably i really wish that i did not jump on the bandwagon did not notice growth still try it every one's hormones are different i was skeptical to try after reading the side effects on amazon i wish i would have followed my initial instinct my face hasn't looked this bad since i was and i took accutane my hair is a grease pit and i gained pounds in weeks with no changes to diet or exercise habits i eat healthy and have not drank a soda or consumed alcohol since taking this product so it's the only cause i can think of for the weight gain used for months did absolutely nothing better off taking biotin no difference but lost money i took this with biotin i started not sleeping well and waking up thru the night this went on for about a month or so so i did some research and viviscal causes insomnia not only did it cause me to suffer from insomnia but it gave me those cystic pimples after i stopped taking this and the biotin the pimples took forever to go away and it took about a week for my sleep pattern to go back to normal i went back to taking collagen c with vitamin e did not notice any change at all beware contains shark cartilege many people are highly alergic took this for mos don t know if it did any thing maybe i keep taking it this product definitely arrive on time and i was hoping to take the product for the full duration of three months but after one month of use i could not ignore the severe heartburns that this product gave me after every use within that month's time i did not see any change made my hair look greasy and unclean daily when washed go fogure didn't notice anything made my hair fall out but everyone is different didn't do anything that i wanted it to if you value your healthy please do not purchase this product it contains shark cartilage and is very high in mercury i had my levels tested after being on this product for months and my mercury levels were literally off the chart the potential hair growth is not worth the detrimental effects of this toxic heavy metal be warned this gives acne to some i broke out real bad do have to say it works makes you break out a lot i've never had that issue waste of money been on it a couple weeks too early to tell not working didn't see any difference these taste soo gross and i would burp them up later didn't even work so i would have gross burps for nothing i just purchased this and have been taking it a couple days today i measured my natural hair growth against the dyed lower half i'll be measuring it again when i finish my first package of pills if the growth is substantially above my usual rate inch cm a month i will buy another box i'll update this review when i'm done with the current box p s i've heard that despite these pills being amazon prime and sold by amazon that they are fakes generic the fact that they are cheaper on amazon compared to walgreens and the viviscal website i'm wondering if it's true i don't know if that will have an impact on the effectiveness or not we'll see update the verdict is in the verdict was actually in a few weeks ago these did not make my hair grow any faster i measured as having gained inch which is actually slightly less than my average i also didn't personally feel any difference in thickness waste of money oh well i bought these tablets because my dermatologist asked me to take them i thought they should be safe cause he recommended them but i was wrong i took these tablets for almost months and i had so may problems so many seeds around my face was the fist thing i notices i am and i haven't had acne for years but these tablets gave me lots of them around my chin and jawline plus my forehead in the beginning i was blaming myself for eating junk food sometimes but later on i realized that it's not because of food besides i had stomach problems like bloating and i was feeling sick most of the days i gained some weight and i had headache for days i read the reviews on this product on amazon and it gave me the idea of this tablet being the source of all of these problems i was dealing with and i was right now it's been weeks i am off of this tablet and i am already feeling much better the acnes are healing obviously and my skin is getting better and no stomach or head ache watch up if you are seeing the same problems it didn't even change my hair much too the only thing i noticed was that my hair was growing faster that happened before with some other multivitamins too i am not going to take this again unfortunately for me didn't work the vitamins involved are what is growing the hair the fish part could and should be changed with another oil it is there for conditioning sharks aren't known for their long hair after all purchase a multi with those vitamins much more economical than this designer product and consume foods containing them hair is a waste product from the body if you take enough in to properly run your machine then the excess will be excreted therefore mutli dose on the vitamins is what is growing the hair nails etc the oils is conditioning and oils other than animal ones olive flax etc work well purchasing this only makes the company wealthy it's like buying the same t shirt for more money just because of the name sewn onto the label i dont know if i would buy these again i didnt notice a big difference in my hair or nails but definitelty noticed that i was eating a lot more i'm not sure what happened as i've been purchasing this for a while the quality of the product dropped tremendously it's a fraud and the company is selling a fake product even the box and the seal is tearing a part the shape of the pill is not the same i don't know if i poisoned myself the quality is so bad do not buy this i had been using viviscal professional for about months and i had excellent results my hair was thicker and stronger i had less hair loss and i had more hair new hair growth i switched over to viviscal extra strength about three months ago because i couldn't find the professional viviscal available on amazon anymore now i'm losing hair everyday and my hair is breaking very easily i'm very disappointed in the extra strength and i'm not sure what the isbetween the two products that is causing such a dramatic difference in any case i'm going to stop using the extra strength viviscal and switch back to the professional viviscal used it for three months straight and i didn't notice any difference honestly this supplement worked wonders not only for my hair but my eyebrows and eyelashes too unfortunately the pills taste smell like dog food and i would gag every time i had to take them or even think of taking them i would become sick just thinking about taking it the taste is that overpowering it is not even worth it for me to take anymore it is a shame bc i think that was starting to really work well in only months does not work been using this product for over months nada happen to my hair it made me nauseous for about hrs after taking it i had to stop taking this immediately i had the worst breakouts from it and am still suffering because of all the acne that came from taking these pills i want to return this item my first package was great but my second is missing a pill who does business like this had a little improvement in the texture of my hair still in the day pack it seems okay haven't really noticed much of a difference yet i'll try one more pack and see what's up honestly i think it's a waste of money don't send anymore cancel after months i have not noticed any difference a waste of money this doesn't do absolutely anything to your hair i tried it for two months you want to grow hair back or stop it from falling take quercetin supplement luteolin which are essential flavonoids and also eat protein plus a multivitamin with all b and minerals google it if you want google pgd also i was hesitant to order from amazon because of reader reviews that said the product they received was less effective or somehow different but my local cvs stopped stocking it so i went ahead and ordered from here then cvs com had it back in stock online and i ordered a second box from there so i was able to compare the two boxes the lot numbers were almost identical only the last digit was different and the external packaging and inserts were identical as were the pills now onto the product itself this has made a huge difference for me i've had thinning problems for a while but in september suddenly it got much worse the thinning was mainly at the temples and my part i started googling and found reviews of this online i've had good luck with various supplements in the past so i gave it a shot it says months before you notice a difference but after six weeks the shedding in the shower was minimal it had been two inch hairballs with each wash i'm just starting month and my hair noticeably thicker before you could see my scalp at the temples and now there's hair i'll keep going with tablets a day until i hit months and then see what happens if i dial it back to but this has really worked for me i asked my dermatologist about it and he'd never heard of it and recommended minoxidil instead i tried that for about a week but it was a mess then i read reports online of people having premature aging issues with it most likely because it gets on your pillow and if your face touches it you're essentially applying it to your face where it can damage the collagen so viviscal is the answer for me at least right now highly recommend update well it's stopped working after taking it religiously for a year my hair started shedding again only worse when i first started the viviscal i noticed my shedding stopped almost immediately and then i had good hair growth maybe i've become immune to it but i'm going to have to look for something else pretty sure these were fake they were a different color and texture from the ones at walgreens took it for seven months and noticed no difference at all i was losing hair because of telogen effluvium this did nothing except affect my wallet also it's made of shark which is loaded with mercury lastly there's a study they quote from a pseudo scientific journal nothing that husband who's a northwestern trained surgeon has ever heard of what you don't know is that viviscal paid for the study and the leading doctor dr hornfeldt is a phd not an md or even a do there are better ways to treat hair loss which i know can be devastating if the cause is simply genetics use rogaine for men do not rub it in google this also find a doctor that will prescribe propecia even if you're a woman done having kids if it's te find the cause have you ferritin and tsh checked ferritin should be at least tsh no higher than hope that helps i've been trying to look for vitamins that actually work for strengthening my hair and these ones did not do any wonders unfortunately i tried them for about months and i don't see improvement won't be buying again hope i'll find something better still losing hair didn't notice anything since adding this pill to my daily regimen i have suffered body aches i am not sure if this is the cause but i will try by discontinuing and see if it changes has anyone else had this reaction so far i have used this product for only one month i have not noticed any change but i know hair regrowth is a slow process so i am giving it more time the stars i gave it is because i am being positive that it would work no change did not work wish i could get my money back i'd give it a negative original viviscal was better now it contains iron which causes constipation not sure yet im confused i got two different shipments and the pills look different from the ones on the first package am i getting the real thing i have mixed reviews about this product due to the fact that i don't know how long it takes to start seeing results personally i haven't noticed any difference in the feel or appearance of my hair not sure yet if i will purchase more maybe if the price was a little lower not worth it no difference on hair growth i've been on this for about months now and have not noticed any changes with my hair i told myself i would give it months before deciding whether or not to continue this but i don't know if i'll make it that long i seem to be one of the unlucky few who has developed acne from this and in searching these reviews it's always in the same jawline area some background i am acne prone and have always had oily skin but now in my s i've had it under control with a good skincare regime however about months into this product i started developing large painful cystic acne around my mouth and along my jawline it's very gross i've never had cystic acne in my life just small zits or blackheads whiteheads after about a month of or large zits i thought my body was finally used to it but then instead of large zits in the same jawline area i'm now getting hard clusters of closed comedones it takes weeks for them develop a blackhead for me to extract or a tiny whitehead for me to pop it's awful i'm changing up my skincare to see if that helps but since the cause is internal the viviscal i'm afraid that the only thing that would help would be to stop taking the pills i'm going to tough it out for more months and see update i'm only taking pill a week to use up the last pack i have my skin has gotten so much better totally not worth it and i did not notice any significant changes to my hair i'm suspicious of the over the top positive reviews on this product and have notice a pattern where if a negative or even slightly critical review is left then the next few reviews left are glowing to try and bury the negative review i feel like they have a very good marketing team on a product that only works on a small number of people i rely very heavily on product reviews and i hate to go negative but i feel like i must share my story it's possible this was just a coincidence but i am a relatively healthy person and i got very sick during the same time i was taking this supplement my legs from knee down became very swollen and my knee joints were extremely achy and painful i was but felt like i was i went to the dr during this time it lasted about months the same time i was taking this and got tested for possible immune problems hypothyroid ra lupus etc and they didn't find anything wrong with me i quit taking this supplement and my 'mystery illness' cleared up within weeks my hair did grow a bit but not where i needed it to it only grew at the back nothing in the front where my thinnest areas were my husband reviewed the package insert with me and he questioned where the shark cartilage is sourced from after doing research we found it's likely from china which leaves me wondering what kind of environment the sharks swam in and how was their cartilage harvested i won't go into details here but please do your own research and then decide for yourself if you can support this practice or put shark's cartilage in your body can't see any difference whatsoever i am in my mid twenties with thin hair i don't have a lot of hair and my scalp is visible i've taken hair vitamins to make my hair thicker and those didn't work i did plenty of research on this product as it is pricey after the great reviews i read i decided to invest and try the product i really wanted to love it i imagined myself having thick gorgeous hair within months i am more interested in thickness than length i was so hopeful i never missed a pill and took it at the same time every single day in the months i took this product i didn't notice much of a difference but i decided to finish the recommend course to give my hair time to grow i do see a small amount of baby hairs but i'm not exactly sure if they grew because of the product my hair was also greasier and my body hair grew at a faster rate my nails also grew faster after the months i reached out to their customer service to see if i could take the product for a few more months and was advised to take supplement a day for months and observe if my hair stayed the same and to see my primary healthcare giver to check to see if there was any underlying cause at play i have already seen my doctor and nothing is wrong i decided to stop taking this product and began taking biotin mcg i am hopeful this will help best of luck to anyone researching this product i hope it works for you i didn't like it and it was to expenses it didn't do nothing for my hair it has not helped don't send anymore well giving it a two indicates that i don't like the product and i can't necessarily say i don't like it because i haven't notice a change at all i tried it for one month with no results so decided to try another month and i am almost done with month two and haven't noticed a single difference one packet was torn i bought this product based on reviews no results at all don't waste your time well i have used it since july mos and it has not given me the results that it says it does wish i could get my money back i also did the shampoo and conditioner they smell awesome but that is it this is for women viviscal is expensive and it doesn't work at all i used the product for days i see no improvement in hair regrowth i see no decrease in hairloss since i used the product my hair has become fizzy and super difficult to style this is new and only started after i began to use product used this and the pro version for several months saw no benefits cannot really tell a difference been on it for six months did not see any results of hair growth i started taking tablet a day since i wasn't sure how my body would react within days i had a terrible acid reflux and burning so bad i was taking medicines to try to make it stop and nothing worked at night i would have to get up and vomit large amounts of liquid i actually thought at first i had a bowel obstruction or something since i had never had this before the only thing different was i had started taking this supplement i stopped taking it and within days all the issues stopped not sure if it can make hair grow or not but it sure causes a lot of acid to be produced in your stomach and vomiting i bought this product after reading all of the fabulous reviews after two months my hair began to fall out more than usual it has fallen out to the point that i would estimate of my hair thickness volume has been lost none of the reviews i continue to research have proof that the vitamin works i should have studied harder first works ok is it really working guess i need to do more research upset my stomach greatly i didn't notice the iron in it works ok i hope see result too early to tell i just started using it my hair seems w less shedding i didn't notice any difference between taking this and biotin horrible taste can't tell any difference the shampoo is ok but smells crappy all day does not do anything more than baby oil would thickness wise the pills are too heavy and or i'm too dehydrated they gave me stomach cramps every time i took one after days i stopped you are a lot better off getting a doctor to just prescribe prenatal vitamins and then getting a generic refill for at your local pharmacy i've been using this on and off for a few years i noticed in the last year it was not working as well my hair was not growing as fast i read other reviews stating it wasn't the same product as sold by the company or say another distributor like walgreens or cvs i went to walgreens to purchase and sure enough the pills look taste and smell differently i saw more results in less than one month of taking the pills from the store than i did in months with the ones from amazon hasn't done anything yet amazon com has allowed false reviews to flourish on this product page i have called their attention to one that uses my image without authorization username kate who has also posted a number of other seemingly false reviews on numerous unrelated products and amazon has refused to take it down the reviews you are reading for this product are largely fake as are many others on amazon com most likely i have used this product and found it to be lacking dont know if it is helping yet this is my first bottle i am keeping my fingers crossed did not work one ingredient listed is shark wtf anyone considering purchasing this product please ask yourself if your vanity is worth destroying the environment and killing marine life lets hope it works doesn't work and i used for months so i gave it a thorough try did not work i have noticed a difference in length of hair but i still feel like my hair is thin saw no results i finished the packet i got in the mail i guess it's a month's supply i was hoping to see some baby hair after a month but instead my hair grew faster i don't need that so i guess this is not for me a doctor told me that this does not have enough biotin in it to make a difference so i stopped buying this and now just get the far less expensive biotin i'm so sad to report it gave me severe insomnia after three sleepless nights i stopped taking it the next day and slept like a baby it did nothing for me didn't even get through a month with these difficult to swallow and upset my stomach saw absolutely no improvement so no incentive to continue wasting more money it's not really doing anything i'll be cancelling soon me hair look more shinny and i increased volume been using this for months haven't noticed a difference may buy it one more time if the price is right i think they worked alright i have another pills i take for my hair that i like better my skin broke out badly as soon as i started taking these supplements i was bummed as i've read heard such incredible things about this product i was also bummed because i stupidly signed up for auto monthly delivery so i have a couple of boxes if anyone wants them i wasn't able take this product as directed because my skin started breaking out bad i'm prone to acne usually right before my period but after about days i started getting deep cystic zits on my chin cheeks and shoulders the tablets are a bit pricy so in an effort to not waste them i now just take two a week to finish out the pack but will not be purchasing again no difference you need more than a vitamin no difference yet it's been months i'm not finished with my first box but thus far the results are promising hair never grew nothing noticeable in fact my hair fell out for my hair it took months to really notice a difference my hair is thicker especially at the top of my head and my edges where i consider to be my stress points in these places my hair is thinner than anywhere else on my head i will continue to take the viviscal for a full months in order to really see if this is really working for me i know everyone's hair growth is different but for me at this point this is not a fast hair growth system but it is working this did not meet up to my expectations i'm not really sure if there was any noticeable hair growth other than what the normal growth was going to be anyway i'm a black woman though with very coiled hair and my edges needs the help and i don't really see anymore growth in that area took viviscal for months at first month i noticed my hair was getting thinner and drier then i said maybe it will get better lately my scalp was swollen and very itchy so i had to stop taking viviscal my scalp felt heavy and really itch but i had to be careful scratching so my hair wont fall i am taking more organic way with onion juice castor oil olive oil honey cayenne pepper onion has sulfur which the hair is made of the itching is going down and my hair has a life now onion smell is stinky but i only leave it for hour i have only been using it for a few weeks cannot tell any difference yet didn't do anything every time i take it i get nauseous i made a mental note of it a few times thinking it was coincidental it wasn't every time i take viviscal my stomach roils it may be great for others but it's really not for me my stomach doesn't like it it isn't working for me anymore caused cystic acne i just started taking this only about a week now but started to develop this rashy cystic acne on my cheeks and jawline i woke up on day or with a painful large red bump on my cheek and i first thought it was an insect bite by the end of the day my face had erupted with large red painful bumps on my cheeks and a line of rashy bumps along my jawline i have never experienced this kind of eruption before and i am on the verge of a panic attack because it looks horrible and it hurts so in my head i start to run through my skin care regiment and i'm feeling really betrayed by my skin care products because my skin had been looking really great lately it was smooth and clear and soft i was baffled because i hadn't changed anything in my skin care or diet then it hit me the only thing i had changed was taking the viviscal i hadn't really researched the side effects of this product which is kind of unusual for me but after realizing it was the only change i had made and then hello horrible painful red bumps all over my face i did a quick search and bingo cystic acne can be a side effect i don't know how many people have this reaction but i think it's a pretty common thing because the company has a response that bodies need time to adjust to supplements but i do take other supplements and i have never had side effects that resulted in skin eruptions i have stopped taking the viviscal i didn't notice any hair growth i followed the regiment as prescribed and to no avail no results i saw nothing and grew nothing i will not purchase this again i used this product for several years a bit expensive but well worth it if it works i also used their shampoo and conditioner be very careful when buying this product i just found out i was being turned over to a collection agency i decided not to spend my money on this product for several reasons and they continued to send it and then if you don't pay for the products they turn it over to the collection department i'll never use them again for me the product did not work this product didn't work for me at all i think product does work in time i have noticed growth in my hair but i have been using product alongside one mg biotin pill a day might be the combination of both growing my hair who knows i also noticed nausea when i do not take the both pills with food fyi i do love the combination so i will continue to buy viviscal i have only been using the product under days so my full review still remains to be seen i'm a hairdresser and i've been taking viviscal for about months and the only thing i can honestly say is my hair had grown in length however i haven't had any luck with regrowing hair that has thinned out hair is still shedding bottle says results take awhile but i've been on so long and i'm thinking about stopping it as it is expensive cancel future orders did not work for me so far so good jury is still out made my hair unbelievably greasy like while i was blow drying it after thoroughly washing and within minutes of applying dry shampoo it would look just completely coated in oil also made my scalp smell terrible oh and made me break out like crazy on my chin which has not been a problem area for me for a long time there were no other diet lifestyle health supplement changes in my life at the time of taking it that could have caused this really really regret even trying it wondering how long it is going to take for my trashed hair and skin to return to normal so i can stop feeling disgusting all the time any slight improvement in hair nails or decrease in hair loss is negated by this repulsive side effect haven't seen much change yet but will keep taking them for a while longer kinda expensive waiting to the results waiting to see results it doesn't seem to working anymore i am not sure what changed haven't seen the change i was hoping for but will keep at it in case it takes more than a package before you see results these we're absolutely horrible as i was taking them i kept getting these weird lumps and bumps everywhere very strange reacation after days i saw no more than my normal growth i do see a little difference but i only took one a day i got this product at the end of aug so far i don't see any hair growth but my hair texture feels softer now i will say that it has made my face breakout tremendously i was taking one tablet twice a day as instructed i even stop for a week to see if it was the viviscsl and much to my surprise it was never the less i still am going to finish the product but reduce the use to one tablet per day instead of two hopefully i'll see some additional hair growth waiting to see if it does what it says it will nothing changed after one month as other products for hairs very expensive for no results i don't see any difference in my hair at all i bought my first day supply directly from viviscal and started to see results in the first days my hair wasn't falling out near as much and it looked like it was getting thicker then i bought my second day supply from reseller and my results completely went away hair started falling out again at a rapid rate and seemed like any improvement in thickness i saw before was gone i have now been using the viviscal vitamin for days along with their shampoo and conditioner and was hoping the original results would come back i am going to order more days worth this time directly from viviscal again and hoping that maybe i just got a bad batch from the reseller this is my nd month and i have not seen any differences as of yet this has shark in it i've never noticed this before when buying so sad and i will not be purchasing again no results when i started taking these tablets it seemed to have an reaction to it and seemed to be very strong i started to cut each tablets down to half and then i just stop taking them all together dissatified hi i am a yr old female with gradual hair thinning but my hair is normal and has shine and body i tried vivisval for weeks and after the nd week my hair texture got very dry and felt like straw i tried this a few months ago for month and the same thing happened after the nd week that is why i stopped it both times due to the straw like texture it gave my hair the company did say to discontinue i started taking these last week regardless of effectiveness taking them twice a day for about five days gave me extraordinary stomach pains and i felt like garbage i am now taking them once in the morning and the pain is gone i have no known sensitivities to any of the ingredients and i'm a generally healthy person but that last dose of the day put me in tremendous pain the morning after and i don't care to suffer that much for vanity's sake does not do what is promised have used this for a couple straight months now not quite sure i am seeing any difference does not work too expensive and really saw no difference in hair volume experienced no effect other than slight weight gain and some stomach upset this could be just how my body reacted to this as everyone may or may not have side effects will not try again i took this for months it doesn't work this is not the original viviscal this item is a fake severe bloating weight gain and terrible stomach cramping going to discontinue my hair fell out in clumps i'm not sure if it's worth the cost thought it was effectively working now after several months i don't see much of a difference regrowing hair is not an easy task if it were there would be no bald people science just not there yet hoping that it is working waiting for the results to show no adverse reaction to the body so far which is a good thing i don't know if this is working after reading the positive and negative reviews i thought i would give it a try and hoping will get positive results i ordered two boxes to get me started but after taking it a week later i noticed my hair was falling out way too much it got to the point where i was freaking out because i saw my hair thinning quickly and got frequent headaches legs and back pains i returned the unopened box and will try to return the one i opened why why oh why do we lose our hair there's not just one answer which implies that there's not just one solution i suppose reasons to include diet hormones stress lack of circulation to the scalp auto immunity exposure to toxins infection i think this product might be effective for chronic dieters assuredly i am not marine protein deficient i eat a lot of fish but this product does contain shark protein i don't eat shark may be you recall something from the 's or ' 's when there was a buzz about shark cartilage being used to treat cancer patients may this stuff is good for some people i can't say definitively that it's helped some people love it perhaps they were protein deficient as for me i rather eat a lot of fish it's tasty in the mean time i'm looking for other hair loss solutions horrible experience with these supplements as far as growth and thickness i saw the beginning of some positive effects after a few weeks of twice daily doses these supplements are documented as possibly interfering with estrogen levels and i began to have all sorts of symptoms viviscal is the only new element in my usual and very healthy routine so i am attributing all the problems to it after about weeks i was at the point of major mood issues mood swings sensitivity anxiety and noticeable fatigue i had trouble sleeping as well which is very unusual for me i am horrified at the side effects and regret having put this formula into my body absolutely awful experience that no amount of hair growth is worth i threw these pricey pills in the trash gave my face horrible cystic acne and break outs everywhere had to stop talking this unfortunately this isn't a review i haven't tried viviscal i'm reading the reviews the information that's missing in most of the reviews is the age of user ethnic background and conditions that may be factoring into your hair loss i'm years old and premenopausal my hair loss started about a year ago as an african american i thought that if i stopped processing my hair with relaxers and dyes the hair loss minimize wrong it's gotten worse i would really like to hear from perimenopausal women about how this product work for them thank you honestly i haven't noticed any improvement at all i've been taking it religiously for three months and nothing waste of this is a scam everyone person on here agreeing that it works is not real or is delusional i came across an article that talked about counterfeit products and they told me to watch out for the ingredients and lot numbers of viviscal products well low and behold i reviewed my box's ingredients from this company and the real viviscal box's ingredients and they differ they are selling this as the original product and it's not also be aware that the product's ingredients are lies and can be dangerous to your health meaning it could be paint thinner and chemicals i have since then bought the real deal and the taste is so different watch out you have been warned i am a registered nurse and i have learned my lesson it was just ok my hair is still falling the pills and box look different from those bought in the store the ones from the store had a slight orange taste these do not i didn't realize when i purchased this that it contains shark fin cartilage it is sickening how how fisherman harvest shark fins not buying this product ever again doesn't work at all i was told it takes several months to see results at the moment i'm waiting horrible waste of money another product with false claims dissapointed i did notice a difference in my hair and nail growth but not enough to continue using it just be careful before you use this and make sure it does not cause you any problems with your blood work labs it did affect mine buy from certified website these look different than the ones you get from viviscal website or ulta com i did not notice any appreciable difference in my hair i took this product for six months my nails didn't noticeably change and some of the pills made my stomach burn one month is not enough to see results don't waste your money this product has done absolutely nothing to help my hair health or growth you're better off buying biotin from your local store at a much lower price i also check with my hair dresser who is welled trained from a high end salon she said use biotin too it worked pretty well in the beginning but after a few months my hair started to fall out again i originally started taking viviscal because it was natural and i felt comfortable not putting a lot of chemicals into my body however when i found that my hair was falling out and i decided to really look into the ingredients what disturbed me was the use of shark cartilage which isn't even proven to be safe to ingest and might cause alzheimer's i did some research and even the new york times believes it might not be safe honestly that's too much risk for so little reward there has been absolutely no change in the growth of my hair i had hoped that it would help to fill in the areas where my hair was thinning but it has not all it has done is cause me to have to eat more i'm usually not a breakfast person but because viviscal has to be taken with food i'm forced to eat something whether i want to or not i will finish the last supply i purchased not because i expect any change but just because i can't see myself throwing it out and basically trashing my money it did not do anything for me i saw no improvement in my hair growth i have been using the product for two months i was about to buy viviscal extra strength when i noticed in the list of ingredients that each tablet contains mg of iron since the recommended dosage is tablets per day that amounts to mg of iron per day for post menopausal women iron supplements are not recommended due to increased risk of iron build up after menopause i wonder if the manufacturer considered the recommendations for iron intake by older women does anybody have an opinion on that the company uses shark fins in this product barbaric don't buy is it worth longer hair i doubt the sharks think so didn't do a thing did not notice any thing couldn't really tell much of a difference nothing this product has not met my expectations hair loss is still an issue and i don't see the change i expected have seen no results yet been using for months i used viviscal for months with no positive results at all i think my hair is in worse condition now than when i started to take viviscal i really wanted viviscal to work but i think months is long enough to see that this supplement just not going to help whatsoever i will try using biotin for now did do anything waist of money so this product is good for hair growth i used it for about months and my hair felt a lot thicker and did get a bit longer however the outbreaks on my neck and jaw line where horrible and so painful i've had to stop taking these tablets as i would rather have spot free skin i'm taking another product which is new to the market called 'hairburst' along with biotin tablets from holland and barrett and my skin is beautiful and clear my hair is gradually getting thicker and longer again i think viviscal is good as it does help hair growth i think its a strong tablet and there are definite side effect causing spots and painful outbreaks after taking just one pill i ended up sick to my stomach for almost hours i thought it was coincidence so i tried taking it again once i felt better and the same thing happened i guess i will never know if it would have helped my hair or not because for how sick it makes me it's not worth trying to find out haven't seen results yet but will continue to use the product fake don't buy this product is made from shark yes shark this product should be ban google shark finning and you will be shocked at the inhuman way these animals are being killed after months of taking the vitamins i don't notice any more growth or thickness than normal i didn't use the shampoo and conditioner since i have c hair and a lot of products don't do so well on my hair i'll go back to the gnc ultra nourish hair where i saw more results i was originally taking natures bounty hair skin nail vitamin and switched to viviscal because of the reviews and my hair stop growing nails stop growing and starting breaking so im switching back to the natures bounty because i seen results immediately from that vitamin i suffer from alopecia and this didnt benefit me i was on it months this item is clearly fake i've been taking viviscal for months and this has strange looking packaging clearly amateur foil printing and the pills themselves look completely different from viviscal in terms of shape and color see photo with real viviscal on the left and fake on the right this product took my hair out after days of using it been taking it for a month so far no change yet still shedding a lot and it has not grown at all will keep you posted i have been using viviscal purchased directly from the viviscal site for about months i am in my late s and have kids and my once long hair has become much less full and doesn't grow like it use to it literally seems to be at a standstill or just growing very slowly i took this with super high hopes and my experience has been next to zero hair growth the only reason i am going to continue to take this to the end of my package is because my hair does feel softer and healthier so maybe it encourages hair growth and hair health but does not make your hair grow on to the next viviscal hair tablets pills ok my boyfriend says i need to blog more so hair here goes i am a jamaican with natural kinky hair nothing special my hair is about neck length hair care routine none and no i don't sleep in satin head piece or comb or plait my hair in any protective style before bed i am too tired at night for all of that i just go to sleep so i thought i should care for my hair more as the once a week shampooing and the occasional castro oil and jojoba oil mix alone would not help me to achieve my hair goal my hair goal shoulder length incredibly thick natural hair think diana ross so i began taking viviscal tablets after having done some research on the product i have been taking two viviscal tablets twice daily for about months now the changes to my hair during this time are as follows months to nothing my hair was shredding due to an improper castro oil and coconut oil mix viviscal did not stop the shredding six months later i did not see any changes to my hair's length or thickness shredding continued i however liked the way it look my hair started to shiny and so continued to take the tablets besides i was not expecting overnight results the benefits reportedly would appear six months and beyond in months th to th i began renovating my kitchen january i am a creature of habit my habit is to sit at the dinner table and sometime during dinner take my viviscal tablets at the time of my kitchen renovation i could not find a plate to eat in and as such seldom sat at my dinner table for dinner so i did not take my tablets for months which by the way was now packed away in a carton box long with my dishes what happen to my hair nothing my hair did not start or stop growing neither did it looked better or worse in my opinion it looked the same way it did when i was taking viviscal months earlier i was about to stop future deliveries of the product when i learnt another three months supply of visvical was on its way what i didn't even finish the last three months supply i have on hand i made a mental note to self that i must track by subscription orders better as i grieved over the excess supply of the product any way i digress i went back on viviscal april and i must say my hair looked shiny feels thick and healthy and it was no longer shredding i continued to sleep without satin hair piece or any special styling before bed the good news i was not suffering from any breakage i dropped coconut oil from my hair regime if you can call what i do i regime a few months later i got frustrated no results i practically gave away an unopened box of visviscal in august of this year i started taking biotin mg and pregnacare tablets no i am not pregnant i am so far enjoying the results which came within a month of use i will let you all know when i obtain my hair goal cheers nikki ps rich i just completed a blog i shared my experience with the world happy i am net socializing lol hasn't seen any improvement on my hair too early to tell possibly takes several months to take hold keeping expectations high i read the reviews and based on those i gave the product a try i knew it would not be an overnight change so used this produce for over months if anything the rate of hair thinning has increased at worst this product may actually be making my hair loss worse at best it just doesn't work i'm thinking the good reviews are likely hired reviewers rather than actual customers very disappointing didn't notice any hair growth on my head but there was a lot downstairs not what i was hoping for this also caused me terrible insomnia after about months of use i have been taking viviscal for approximately months or more i believe it was working very well and my hair wasn't falling out anymore i also noticed my hair was thicker since i have stopped taking it because of an ingredient that is probably detrimental to your digestive tract it is called hydroxpropl methyl cellulose i have digestive problems anyhow and i don't want to add anything else to my problems i was wondering if the company could comment on this or possibly remove this ingredient from the viviscal days of use didn't work for me not a lick better luck to others put me down for being a fool in believing this product could really do what it claimed i gave it a chance for a year nothing to be honest i'm now wondering if it helped thin the hair i already had then they can sell another product in its place go by your first instincts which i'm sure is i doubt it will work but will try it save your money as soon as i started using this product wads of my hair was falling out in the shower to the point where i was crying because so much of it was falling out i gave it about months to get used to but my hair was still falling out buyer beware i bought this product because my hair will not seem to grow past my shoulders i have been taking this product for two weeks i have gained pounds i have even doubled up on my workouts and it already eat very healthy i couldn't figure out what was going on i then looked at the side effects of this product bingo also i have had random breakouts that is also another side effect i would rather be fit with clear skin then have longer hair that is if this product even works i will be throwing the rest of it in the trash very satisfied made me so nauseous i had to stope taking only took this product for a few days but it did not agree with me caused severe constipation which i imagine was down to the huge amounts of iron in the product i love the vivascal product but when i ordered it this time my viviscal packaging was very different then it normally i think this is a fake product and i am going to definitely be returning it and contacting viviscal about it i've been taking this for hair loss caused by telogen effluvium for about the past six months at first it slowed some of my hair loss and allowed hair to regrow despite this my hair would still go through cycles of intense hair loss even when taking this vitamin overall i would not purchase this again as it is too expensive for something that is not effective it may be good for others but i would not purchase it for telogen effluvium used it for only weeks so i can't say if i see any results yet will update my review if i see any new hair growth it's the second months i'm taking it not sure yet if it works or not needs to be taken for monthes didn't work for me and i tried it for months straight the pills are not cheap i am very disappointed i really don't think there is a miracle pill for hair growth cheap and delivery was fast it didn't work for me i need for the hair on my head i now have hair on my face i stopped using hopefully the facial hair will not return just started using this weeks in too early to tell but i have to tell you the taste is disgusting it tastes like fish food blech i seriously despise taking the pills morning and night so i try to swallow quickly with a big gulp of water i am not sure if this was just me but i took this product for three months and saw no improvement in the growth of my hair or nails but thankfully i had no bad side effects either unfortunately viviscal also made me break out i read all the reviews before purchasing viviscal they were all amazing a couple of folks had reported breakouts but just a small percentage i thought i'll give it a try and if i become affected with breakouts i'll discontinue use so i gave it a try sure enough in the first week my face and back broke out with acne first one pimple and then five on my face and an ugly breakout on my back i discontinued use the breakout receded on its own within yet another week thank goodness for that i've instead placed myself on a high quality norwegian fish oil purchased at whole foods the oil eventually comes thru the skin's pores so even with the fish oil i am experiencing more oily skin but at least no serious breakouts i heard flax seed is also a rich source of omega i may give this a try after i have finished my fish oil tablets i really can't see any difference after using this product just okay i have used this product for mo perhaps noticed a small decrease in hair shed but no overall thickening eyelashes however are now very long healthy i did not receive all tablets in the package one of the foil packages was cut pills were missing not sure if this going to work on me yet started taking it and i have not seen any differences my hair is thinning and i pray it would help tried this for almost months and didn't notice any huge improvements but hair didn't get worse either the real concern that i have is that the pills would look different from package to package i'd get a new box and still have a few leftover from the old box and they would look like totally different pills i'd be careful buying this product from this site you might be getting a placebo or nothing at all i used it for several months the instructions tell you to use it for a while to give it a chance to work so i did my hair is still getting thinner no regrowth no change at all very disappointing it's definitely not worth the money i've been trying to take this as per the directions on the package since i first bought in months ago after the first week i got terrible leg cramps and overall pain in my legs i stopped taking my regular vitamins and just cut down on the viviscal to days a week once a day to see if the leg pains diminished and they didn't it's too bad because i do feel that my hair has been falling less than the usual amount but it's hardly worth it to me to suffer these leg pains i have stopped using it maybe i'm having an abnormal reaction to one or more of the ingredients and others might not be so sensitive to it in which case it's worth trying if you have thinning hair caused cystic acne in the first three days of taking only half the recommended dose i used this everyday for months with no positive effects waste of time and money i purchased months supply of it and won't even open the last box don't want to waste any more of my time i'm almost finished days of a different hair vitamin and will review that after a full days as well could not tell that it helped didn't seem to do much okay i buy viviscal once every few months to help my issues during my pregnancy and after giving birth my hair broke off and fell out i was desperate this stuff works it is amazing however for whatever reason this past purchase wasn't the real thing i'm not sure if the product comes from different providers or what but this isn't the same viviscal that i've purchased from here the past times how do i know again i've taken it several times the first couple days of taking the real stuff my hair feels oily i've been taking this newest box and have not had that happen my hair is acting like it did when i took just regular cheap biotin from walmart which really does nothing for me so anyway the real viviscal is fabulous i just have a pretty strong feeling that this isn't the real viviscal this time i ordered my fist box of viviscal from the same seller in march the product worked great saw new hair growth my hair felt soft was visibly healthier loved the product so much so of course i ordered another box what a nightmare my hair is brittle dry and it keeps falling i honestly think my hair is worse than when i first started it keeps falling i had to stop taking them i did notice that the packaging was different all the pills kept popping out of the casing maybe they were fake i will only order straight from the website from now on this experience has been traumatizing to a woman with thin hair i don't see much difference after consuming this for a month or two we are better of eating fresh wild seafood seaweed not farmed in dirt polluted conditions that are rich in nutrients no difference have taken it for about months with no positive results i used this product exactly as directed for approx months and never noticed a change in my hair or nails i hope others have better success i really have not noticed much difference in my hair since starting viciscal my hair isn't any thinner but it's not any thicker than it was the tablets had such a distinct fishy taste that i wanted to gag after swallowing perhaps it really does help however i just can't get over the taste taking the pills makes my stomach turn i was taking the hair growth essentials maximum strength and my hair loss had stopped completely but because i didn't like having to swallow big pills i decided to try viviscal i'm days away from finishing the box and my hair loss is back it went from zero hair fall and now is falling even when i pass me hand hair will come off i don't know if it is a time of adjustment because o changed the products but i'm really worried i think i will go back to the other brand and just deal with swallowing the big pills i was ready to try this based on customer reviews but realized when looking at the ingredients list that it contains shark sharks are well known to be an endangered species so i cannot in any good conscience buy this product sharks have a scary reputation based on misinformation but even if they were everything that media makes them out to be their numbers are dwindling due to humans and it is up to us to keep them safe barbaric practices such as shark fin soup are banned in many areas now due to awareness of the shark's plight i'm not going to consume something that actively kills an endangered creature just for vanity that's a terrible reason and a sad choice i'm actually surprised it's being sold at all please don't buy this product i used this product for over months and saw no results at all very disappointed took this for about months did see improvement in my hair texture but not a lot of growth i stopped because i started getting horrible head aches and gained about lbs in just over a month not worth the small benefits to my hair while im not sure how much of a differnece this has made the ingredients are certainly healthy and worth a try i did not notice anything i used this product for six months jus as instructed to see good results i saw maybe th of an inch more than i would have without the pills although they did make my hair grow a tiny bit faster it's just not worth the large price tag for me caused cystic acne around jaw hairline i've never had acne like this ever it's the only change i've made in my routine plus it was expensive it's made of shark cartilage which makes me sad sad big hurtful acne don't do it i bought viviscal for my thin edges traction alopecia i know they can grow back because it did with minoxidil but i'm allergic to minoxidil it's been months and nothing i will continue for another month or so then i'm throwing in the towel didnt work the amount of biotin is too little it should at least have mg the zinc in this can cause a copper deficiency leading to nerve damage and nerve pain zinc should be take with copper or it will lead to a copper deficiency i started buying this a little over a year ago and while it used to work it doesn't anymore just gives me insomnia why does this product have biotin in it biotin has never been proven to increase hair growth and often causes cystic acne i should have read more carefully but i read online several things about viviscal's proprietary blend of ingredients the ones from the sea and was eager to try it out i was really excited for a non biotin hair growth pill but then they go and add biotin anyway why do that if your product is so good already i saw that one of the other ingredients was zinc which i've read may help prevent biotin breakouts so i thought i'd give it a shot i'm in the midst of a horrible breakout now so i have to throw the rest of these out they're useless to me i didn't really see a change in my hair while taking these but it was only for a few days i do not see much of a difference compare to when i use phyto works a little too well be careful if you have had laser hair removal it promotes new hair growth there too and will reverse your laser treatment after years of hair loss due to stress and low iron i really thought this was the answer for me i took them for a little over a week and every single day i had an upset stomach to the point that i almost couldn't leave my house and the final straw was having to leave a meeting additionally i haven't had a pimple in years and i suddenly started breaking out coincidentally my symptoms stopped as soon as i discontinued this product i'm so disappointed i really thought this was it it seems to be a good product and worked for a lot of people but it simply did nothing for me it's been about days and i've only been taking one a day at night because the tablets were causing my skin to break out a lot i'm not sure if i've noticed a difference but a good friend said my hair texture was less frizzy my nails are super strong and long however i am confident that i'll see improvement in my hair with continued use update the pills in first batch i ordered were wide and flat and made in ireland supposedly i definitely have noticed a difference in my hair quality since i've been taking them just ordered my second box and the packaging looks like a knockoff as well as the pills being smaller in diameter and thicker and made in the us supposedly i emailed viviscal the lot numbers and expiration dates so hopefully they can confirm which batch is real i will be returning these pills pending their response there is a reason the price is significantly cheaper than the pills at the store first order is the box pills on the right and the lot number on the bottom second order is left top i think the second one is the fake update i checked the lot numbers and expiration dates with the company and they told me that both boxes were legit but they have two factories which would account for the differences in the pills however the second box made in the us is giving me really bad unrelenting acne the first box from ireland also caused breakouts but that subsided after a week or so whereas this time it won't stop if i can consistently get the pills made in ireland i'll keep taking them cause they definitely do seem to be making some difference if not the acne is a dealbreaker this scale does not work and is not calibrated right this vitamin didn't meet my expectation to growing and healthier hair i took it for six months and there wasn't any changes for me so i cancel my subscription didn't work came delivered broken wish it was louder this was a gag gift but literally only worked for minutes before the speaker crapped out sucks low volume and muffled sound hard to understand but it is moderately funny kind of corny but every time my husband comes in my office i get a kick out of pressing it wish it just said one word and not cycle through assorted mini speeches that feature the word wasn t very good wish it just said b llsh t sound is somewhat distorted hard to comprehend what it's saying we got a laugh out of it anyway the product arrived in a package that was taped together the button has scratches and stains on the sides as though it had previously been used the speaker works fine came with working batteries because of the timing of the gift i am going to keep the button however i will be more cautious in the future when buying from this seller received without batteries with huge scratches looks like used not impressed by the product this is really bs it's cool present for a joke but is not too laud and is not something super impressive can t hear it the speaker seems to be doa barely audible bought two neither is good not very loud can barely hear it was a birthday gift for a friend so it was a little disappointing sound in not good would not recommend not good at all not loud enough works once out of every times put new batteries in and it still only works when you move the batteries around great gag gift as in most of the other reviews this would be more fun if it was louder this button arrived quick and is a gift for a coworker i am very disappointed as the button works maybe every times when pushed which is bs going to change batteries and hope it works as it is supposed to work update more pressure when pushing the button seems to be helpful the audio on this button is horrible can't hear what it is saying do not buy item doesn t work very low sound a waste of time this is much smaller than you would expect bought of them an one only lites up does not make any comments this product did not work it was a whisper the batter compartment screws were stripped and we had to break the button to get to batteries horrible purchase speaker is worthless horrible it s not the one i wanted the bs button i thought i was buying much better than the way this one is saying it don t purchase not sure if i got a bad one or it's just this quiet but you can barely hear it pretty disappointed works not very loud garbage never worked piece of crap not funny i wanted to return it and they won't pay for return shipping plus the return form asked me to print out a label to return it and there was no image on the sheet to print bunch of clowns can't hardly make out what it is saying save your money it is only ok it is not as loud as i had hoped for but not worth the time to package it up and send back didnt work its a really good fun way to amuse your colleagues but the volume is not enough would be really great of the volume could be increased arrived given as a gift no good disappointed with phrases button broke after a couple of months difficult to understand the words poor quality voice recordings the button sold by talkie toys is much better we got this as a gift for a funny guy friend of ours it was funny for a few times but got old i don't know if he ended up keeping it but it was still worth giving it to him for his initial reaction haha fun it's fun it's cute however it should be louder received and needed batteries and is broke on one side and not very loud it seems to have been used before not a good thing the audio could be louder this wasn't working when it was delivered i tried to change the battery and all the screws were stripped very cheaply made too quiet arrived not working with leaking batteries changing the batteries didn't fix it i did add a star for the immediate easy and free return process i had hopes for this one it's okay volume not very loud can hardly hear it the snippets really aren't as good and timeless as other buttons not as happy with this one as my other knew what i was getting from on line audio and it still use it but didnt' realize it was so quiet and it just doesn't announce and impact like other buttons so not all that impressive pretty neat little toy but it feels kinda cheap never worked just took it apart and discovered the batteries were corroded solid waste of money cute concept but not as good as the yes and no buttons by zany toys there aren't as many different sayings and the volume is really low on this one this product's batteries were corroded and rusted the springs holding the batteries i need a refund i received the package on time but after an hour of trying to open the battery compartment i found that the batteries had leaked and oxidized it was completely useless at that point i bought this item for my dear friend and gemmy couldnt help me out quieter than i expected super disappointed it looks dirty im embarrassed to give it to anyone the button works just fine but the back is all tapped up and the frint had card board taped to it leaving a grimy film on the whole front making it look dirty the plastics all bent and home cut in some places to let the sound out im guessing cardboard is bent too like it was opened n put back together by a child i wanted this for a holiday gag gift however the battery box was totally corroded battery leaked all over funny but not very loud it's not loud at all you can barely hear it not loud enough cheap not loud enough to be heard over any backround noise cute product but it didn't work when i got it seller was amazing about it though sound quality was poor may have been defective i will be returning wish it was louder great toy just quiet this was funny when it was working didn't last very long maybe months with sporadic use duplicate listing of asin b l mqo the product itself is bulls i bought it as a present but the battery was burned inside and when i tried to change it it started smoking i'm extremely dissapointed because i bought it for someone as a present and couldn't give it to them and also my money was wasted it's also a real struggle to open the back where you put the battery because you need a very small screw driver i would not recommend buying it i got this for my husband as a gag gift now unfortunately i thought it would say bullsh t when you press the button it does not it only makes a buzzer noise it only has like different sentences and only of them is actually funny not so loud this arrived on an afternoon when i truly needed a bs button unfortunately it didn't work it just said hbrrrbf the first time and then nothing either it's defective or my craptastic day broke the bullshit meter the audio is too soft can barely hear it compared to my no button this broke after only a few hours i returned it and never got my money back or a replacement not loud enough you have to put it right against your ear to hear it very low volume hard to hear sometimes but great for the office bought two one worked great and the other doesn't stripped screw to battery compartment unable to use for gift product description indicates x x inches but this button is actually inch diameter and inches high definitely smaller than expected grandson liked it the button came with the actual button part tilted awkwardly but it functions properly it's very noisy hard to understand what it's saying cheap looking comparing to 'zany toys llc' buttons very unhappy with this purchase this item came in a box with other items but it was very dirty like it had been laying on a shelf in a dusty warehouse full of metal filings it didn't work while still in the plastic cardboard packaging even though the button was fully available to push down so i opened the package pulled it out and attempted to check the battery situation the battery compartment would not open at all i'm returning for a refund very disappointed cheap piece of crap beware broken in the package has a few different phases but it's really quiet would be or stars if it was loud and would definitely be if you could switch between phrases and just have it repeat bs every time you hit the button i ordered two of these and the first one worked one day and quit talk out bs someone owes me a replacement complete rubbish very small and not loud i'm sure you can download an app on your smart phone for a lot less not as many sayings as i had hoped but oh well i only say i hate it because it came with completely corroded batteries that had leaked acid and fused the battery compartment shut i have ordered another one and hopefully it will work this one did not work at all also only due to the obviously not very bright packager at amazon this item was shipped in a huge box with pounds of cat litter so yeah it got crushed addendum received a replacement for the corroded one however the replacement was defective it would say it's little statements but the light would only flash now and then briefly it too was returned for a refund after two bad units i give up too soft not that loud i just don't think this should be in the kids' toys section that is all well this is some bs hahahaha but seriously though the batteries inside were dead and had burst and corroded inside the product after discarding the burst batteries cleaning the inside of the unit and replacing the batteries it still didn't work properly what a bunch of bs i figure the corrosion messed up the battery contacts to the point where they wouldn't carry a charge anymore oh well one more piece of chinese junk for the landfill fun product but needs more robust volume it's just ok not what i expected looking for it to say bulls which it did not i bought this to replace an old worn out bulls button we have had a lot of fun with the old one for many years the volume on the new button is so low that the effect of the button is somewhat lost very disappointed even the color red is not the bright color in the picture if you buy this prepare to return it or do maintenance or return it upon receipt bs button would not work i removed the screw to gain access to the batteries here i found two junk quality batteries which were dead and had leaked electrolyte in the battery compartment as well as corroded battery contacts i cleaned up the alkaline using white vinegar and swabs and burnished the corroded contacts i put in two duracell aaa batteries and replaced the cover and screw all is now fine however as not everyone is a technician of course you will have to return the unit at this price and my time it was better to fix it i say to the manufacturer clean up your act and get a quality battery this is the second of these i have bought and the first was fine however the batteries had a very short life now i know why broke pretty quick smaller than expected very light volume was dirty and dusty had to change the batteries too it is funny but it is the quietest button i've heard volume level way too low you have to be less than a foot away to hear it not really loud enough volume could be higher volume is so low you can barely hear it and words are slurred i ordered of these and only worked upon opening them christmas day very disappointed the that did work we had quite a few good laughs volume is quite low hard to hear its just ok i envisioned this to be a lot cooler than it is it's a funny idea but i never actually use it as much as i thought it would it gets old quickly not very loud at all you have to hold is close to you to hear tried to open the battery compartment but the cheap aluminum screw stripped this could have been a great but the batteries were corroded rusted in place and it didn't work i gave this as a gift to my boss so that was very embarrassing volume way to low hard to hear hi the bull s button is very very hard to hear total piece of crap couldn't even turn it on straight out of the box the tem arrived on time to my house how ever the screws on the item are way to hard to removed and for that i couldn't use it i give it as a gift for the office and couldn't get it to work very disappointed this item is very funny except it has no volume you cannot hear it it may be defective i'm going to return this item this is totally a gag gift but it is completely annoying the sayings are ridiculous and i do not recommend this even for a gag gift this could be great fun but the volume is so low you have to put it close to your ear to hear it your buddy out coworker next to you will not be able to hear it you will find yourself laughing alone did not work at all new batteries and did not work at all the button doesn't work sometimes skip it the package is damaged the product is scratched everywhere i seriously feel like i paid for a second hand product right now it does not work and gave an awful impression during christmas they thought i was refurbishing an old gift avoid tried it when i got it did not work thought it didn't come with batteries so i opened it to install batteries to find here were batteries in it so i said ok it just needs new batteries put new ones in nope still didn't work this is ok nothing interesting or funny i returned it not very loud at all battery screw was very hard to take off no sound no on off switch should have saved the money and order a pizza can barely hear it piece of junk disappointing secret santa gift but i didn't have to pick something to go along with it expecting a nice loud bull and instead it's quiet and hardly works piece of junk broke after about uses lasted all of minutes this was a waste of money dumb sayings and they're not loud it's ok very very quiet and is kinda crappy sound quality got it for a gift for my aunt and it came taped up and such this button is bulls you can even hear it you have to put it up to your ear and even then you can barely hear anything volume was not as high as i have seen on previous models battery dead open packages stripped screw on battery door the batteries were leaking on arrival it worked after i installed new batteries bought this as a gag gift for a friend shipping was quick however i once it arrived it appears to be opened and the batteries are dead there was tape along the back of the package as if it was keeping it together battery compartment screw was stripped and even though i was able to get the compartment open and put new batteries in the product did not work it works but sound is so quiet can hardly hear it i have an easy button and i guess i expected it to sound similar kinda pathetic actually very disappointed volume way too low could barely hear it and it had no volume control unfortunately it's got different things it says in sequence only one of them is truly in the spirit of it's name junk broke after a few uses save your money very disappointing the volume level is so low that the listener must hold it up to their ear to hear it i bought one a couple of years ago and it was fun and loud enough to be heard above normal conversation we replaced batteries and tried several ways to fix it finally we threw it away the first one i received had a low volume problem per the reviews the volume should be fairly loud i returned that first one and had it replaced i just received that replacement and the volume was still low i am going to keep it due to the low cost but i would have been happier with a higher volume update we had guests for thanksgiving and they wanted to hear our bs button five of us gathered around it and we could not hear it very well everyone had to be quiet and then it was still barely discernible yes the batteries were brand new and afterward they were verified with a battery tester i used to have one of those staples that was easy buttons and i know that was loud just short of the return deadline so back it goes very small and somewhat cheaply made but you do get what you pay for the volume is low and doesn't have too many phrases not that great but not worth returning i got this cause sis had one the spoken words are the same as hers but for some reason mine ate up batteries brand new batteries i hit the button twice in a month and the batteries were dead this happened times with batteries from different packages and mfg'ers so there was something wrong with mine held up for a few drops then quit working take care of it and you'll enjoy it or your friends will hate it for a long time its very quiet have to hold it near your ear to hear what it says not loud at all piece of junk funny but not loud enough didn't last but a week had the button on my desk for about min and it broke before that the volume was very low do not buy received mine today and it came with batteries however i wish it did not because the battery was corroded and the battery compartment was ruined due to the corrosion the volume on this thing is too loud even when i put tape around the speakers gift it's just ok the alerts are good but could be better for example b s alert defcon well defcon is peace time it should have been defcon you can't expect much for bucks i guess had to buy a second one as the first stopped working after presses this one sits untouched on my boss' desk so not sure how reliable it is not what i thought it was going to be i thought it was going to be like the that was easy button and just say one phrase that was bull hit instead it says a few different phrases in a weird cowboy voice meh it's funny for awhile but the jokes get old parental guidance advised for younger users it didn't impress me have to whack button to make it work it never worked and that was embarrassing because i gave it as a gift didn't work the button i hot didn't look anything like the picture different shape more like an ufo black not cool i wanted to put it by my easy button and wanted something that looks alike as shown in the picture a friend of mine liked it so i gave it to him instead of returning it i call bullsh on my bullsh button mine came with batteries and although the light comes on when you press the button the button doesn't produce any sound i swapped out the existing batteries but even that didn't fix anything i guess the button still has some visual humor value so it's not really worth the trouble of returning exchanging it still i guess the joke's on me very cheap not very loud sound was very low at first then would not work returned not very loud the volume is minimal even at full blast very light i returned mine not with the money arrived broken package was opened sent it back pros does what it says cons only has a few phrases the red part cracked after a few weeks of moderate to heavy usage it was not like expected it says phrases involving bs i thought it was just bs fun gift with a variety of phrases sound is much too low can only be heard by the person holding the button the batteries were dead upon arrival since then it seems to burn through them even when not used it must have some internal battery usage it is fun to use at work everyone loves it got this for a gift for my sons but they had no use for it they thought the product was good but just didn't have a use for it really just stupid not that great a button the voice is not loud which is the most important feature of this toy it did not work even with new batteries sent it back it's okay but w not buy again needs more phrases couldn't under stand the voice bought it after getting the no button it's not nearly as charming and the voice almost has a drawl to it the batteries were dead still didn't work with batteries not even worth my time returning i just wanted it to say one word when i pushed it but it has a number of different sayings i don't use it much useless worst audio ever it says really long sentences i just wanted it to say busllshit not loud enough got two and one of them had a problem it was an electrical contact issue with the button i had to take it apart and fix it otherwise the button does what it is advertize to to didn't work returned it says three different things not worth it cute for a construction supervisor i bought this item to play it at work where i have a few coworkers that deserve the message however the volume of this little gadget is so low that turns it useless returned right away this is so stupid the volume is poor and the saying make no sense i bought this for my son who gets a kick out of toys like this but this is just a waste of money i read the reviews and people seem to like it a lot so i am wondering if some fool decided to make some new recordings the ones i got make no sense i have requested a return on it funny gift it was smaller than expected i ordered of them and of them did not work after struggling minutes to get the tiny screws out of the back so we could replace the batteries i was somewhat irritated junk don't waste your time or money didn't order this i am keeping this because it is a joke gift but it was scratched and although it came with batteries they were dead and need to be replaced annoying just received it today and it already broke now it just makes a mechanical noise when the button is hit i ordered two of them neither of them worked not enough volume it never showed up i am disappointed we were planning on giving it as a gift this product was broken when i got it impossible to get to the batteries do not buy this product complete waste of money extremely repetitive also terrible jokes cannot recommend d o a dead on arrival button didn't work from the moment i opened the box tried new batteries still does not work sending it back amiusin cycles through a few different sayings not all of them are funny its well made but a bit too loud and there's no volume control on it funny the soud only works a small portion of the time button mostly just flashes dumb naw skip this one it is funny but the volume is to low i still enjoy it it is fun it just buzzes and doesn't say bulls but still served it's purpose i guess as a gag gift could be louder for a job site too quiet can't hear it i was expecting one strong voice the button is weak in sound as the no and applause the multiple voices lessen the impact in my opinion the staples that was easy is an excellent example i ordered this item and it didnt work i thought it could be the batteries so i changed it and still it didnt work even the batteries looked used ima just forget about it and not bother to return it or whatever im not gonna be wasting my time not worth the money sound is very low and the message of the button is too long it broke after a day i just wish this had more phrases to play through it does not just say bullsh t like i thought it would i has all these different sayings i call bullsh t etc its still funny but not what i expected ordered this for my hubby unfortunately it never worked then him informed me someone else at work already had one so didn't bother with trying another uh this one is a waste of money just pass on by it might be used once but it just won't sustain its original appeal it descirbes itself perfectly in only one word not heavy like the easy button but the bs button was enjoyed by my brother in law as a joke gift because he is always saying this is bs lol got this for my husband's office at his dealership but now he brings it with him everywhere a couple weeks ago things got pretty tense between my husband and our waitress at the olive garden so much so that he refused to communicate with her every time she tried to speak he would press the bs button eventually the manager arrived and offered to comp our desserts but my husband called bs and hit the button again it was uncomfortable but definitely a better alternative to the fits he used to throw before we got the bs button i'm here picking up a third replacement because he snuck it into friday night shabbat services and the rabbi confiscated it mid service which was very embarrassing this button looks like it would be funny but it's really not great gave to my husband and he is not a fan i got it for a white elephant party its worth the money if you dont keep it still pretty funny at first the light would flash but i wouldn't get any sound after smacking it a few times i started getting sound so i figured it was a loose connection eventually it quit again i opened it up but didn't see any obvious broken connection i assume the piezo speaker must have an internal fault it's never worked again unfortunately i waited too long to return it it's an ok gadget to have but the volume needs to be higher if in a group of talking people no one would ever hear it but its a great novelty gift and for the cost it's not worth returning i was looking for something more similar to the staples that was easy button the description does not tell you that there are different phrases or what those phrases are i loved it i got it to keep on my desk at work because i work with a lot of bsr's it lasted about two weeks at that same time i bought a no whining and a no button and they both are still working these were purchased about six months ago does not work well can barely hear it do not have paperwork was a gift and i just found out you can't hear what it is saying it's hard to not like this item simply for the fact that it's a bs button it is a way of saying how you really feel or being funny without having to try i believe that's why it gets love it reviews any purchase online should be reviewed not saying anything new multiple phrases just have to hope at least one fits your style didn't come with batteries when i ordered it just a heads up but doesn't impact rating as the title suggests great gift for others because the idea alone make people smile and chuckle personally not my thing at the moment maybe i just have to increase my daily portion of bs love this the only bad thing i can say about it is that it's not very loud the have to hold it by your ear to hear it could have been somewhat louder but worked fine and was passed around for quite a while at the xmas package swap i wish it only said the words written on it in stead it said sentences with the word in it not as expected i just wanted it to say the one word the item cam in an open container the included batteries were not included so it was an obvious return from someone else ashed for a replacment to be sent in time for christmas but did not received well it was the hit of the party this bad taste office trinket was worth whatever it cost as a source of amusement every office should have one at every desk it's nice for a silly gift to give someone the only issue is that the batteries were included but already dead it was completely dead and no way to replace batteries waste of money for me i've already sent it back i rated this with a start because it's a cute funny item but i am disappointed in the sayings and the sound i have other kinds of these buttons and they have all been clear and easy to hear but this one is muffled and hard to understand only one or two of the sayings are really funny they others are kind of mundane it didn't work when it arrived i had to open it up and replace the batteries that came with it after having had such fun with the other ones i have this one just did not meet my expectations and is not the same quality i hoped it would be a simple bullsh t but its not there are four or five different lines it says its not what i expected but i guess its ok like the other reviewer who received this product in november of mine does not work it lights up but states none of the phrases as listed in the product reviews i am quite disgusted doesn't anyone test these things before they get shipped it was to be a gag office grab bag gift i purchased this item at the same time i purchase the applause button same story it didn't work either yep it's a bs button alright ah got for someone with a crazy job it is cute but the voice takes away from the humor it is okay had to return to amazon for a refund because the button didn't work when pressed despite saying try me on the packaging there were no batteries included after putting aaa batteries it it lit up and talked but pressing the button didn't do anything the only way to make it talk was to pull the batteries out and put them back in it it is very cheaply made it is funny but mine is hard to hear even in a quiet room with new batteries in it i think this is going to be a great gift and can't wait to hear it but first i must run out and buy two aaa batteries i thought it included the batteries because the packaging says try me i fell for that a few times before i opened the battery compartment to check as soon as i install the batteries i will press the button five times in a row to salute the person who didn't put batteries in it thought it would just say bullsh t like an 'easy button' makes a lot of excess sounds still would reccomendas a gag gift i can't give any stars since it arrived either defective or with dead batteries it is supposed to be a gift and the only way i can determine if it is broken or if the batteries are dead is to open the package very dissatisfied it came open and made no sounds or light nothing it was like it was just thrown into box without anyone checking tom block first it's not as pictured the one i received has a black concave tapered base the biggest problem that i have is that the internal piece that connects the battery to the unit that creates the sound disconnects very easily it's not too difficult to fix but why should you have too right after fixing it a few times i just hung it on my cubical wall as a decoration it still gets some laughs which is why it was bought i suppose also it is loud you will probably want to put some tape or something over the speaker to dampen it if you are in an office just a heads up the speaker is really tinny and pretty poor and the phrases are good there just aren't enough of them i want more it's a lot of fun died after days 'nuff said but assuming you fix it or use it in its short life span this product comes with several different lame 'bs' quotes i was hoping for a simple bull s you're better off yelling it out at other people rather than saying it to yourself for having bought it got this as a gift for my step mother and she loved it but unfortunately it broke the next day definitely not worth it voice is difficult to hear low volumne not adjustable when i say bullsh t i mean it wimpy looks good sounds lousy i have a friend that bought a no button and i think that's great i bought this thinking it would be similar but the volume is low the speech quality is poor it only has about phrases which are not inspiring like warning bulls t detected this would be far better if modeled from the no button simply repeating the word in many different voices and different emotional tones buy the no button you'll enjoy it more i returned this item for two reasons it said batteries included i saw batteries nowhere in the box so i assumed they were already in the device but it wouldn't work when i tried to open up the device to see if the batteries were in there and working the screws were so worn down that i couldn't get the screwdriver to say in the slots i returned it immediately first of all these are way way smaller than you would think and secondly i bought two for gag gifts and both stopped working after a day total waste of money i bought two of these buttons for gag christmas presents the other being the wtf button and i find them both to be crap the voices used are very irritating and the comments are plain stupid i'm very disappointed this these purchases it's a well made product that will last the user for a long long time but this particular model wasn't among the best as far as the actual phrases it says are concerned i thought it would just say bs but it says a whole lot more its funny but i would've liked it better if it just simply said the word i was disappointed just didn't find it very funny so i returned it but i suppose it's a matter of opinion and to each his own the case is flimsy and there are no sticky feet to prevent it sliding off the desk when i slap it further the messages are hackneyed and show very little creativity i ordered this for a friend at work was very disappointed i still have it i didn't give it to her for christmas still have it this was a xmas gag gift for my little brother i believe it was a hit i do hour he enjoys it gave a three only because it was a gag gift and not a toy i was expecting the button like the staples button to simply say the bs phrase when you hit it this one talks in a texas accent and says all of these different phrases that i guess is funny but this is not what i wanted and was not stated that it would have all of the phrases in the review definitely will not be purchasing or recommending this to anyone the only thing i could do with it was use it in a white elephant gift at christmas it was a simple button that brought great pleasure it had lines that it circulated from none just simply called out bs the voice of the button kind of reminded me of a rodeo announcer it is ok batteries inside were dead it is a little smaller than i hoped but it works and will provide a few laughs this was an absolute waste of money it didn't work so it was basically a plastic button this was worthless junk the button is pretty cheap the phrases are not that funny but it entertains the coworkers it's a cute gimmick and not very expensive what a rip off dont waste ten bucks on this piece of garbage cheaply made and very small dont know if the others are any better but definitely dont get this one button breaks really fast cheaply made would have been great if it had lasted longer would have been great if it had been made better i ordered this for a friend as a gag gift there are several problems with this order first of all the button is nothing like the one shown in the pictures or described in the text they describe it as lighting up and buzzing it does neither the phrases they list it says none of them the look of the item not even close but that's not the worst part they shipped it with the batteries in and activated and it was shipped in a flimsy package not really a box this meant that just touching the box pushed the button i had this delivered to my office it was saying bullshit phrases over and over again as they brought it to my desk i'm lucky i wasn't fired as we can't use that kind of language here this seller really needs to be more careful and accurately describe the item also do something in shipping the keeps the button from playing i have a bulls t button exactly as pictured when i bought the product however a different version of the button arrived today and i am very disappointed it has some different phrases and a different voice than the one i currently have don't want to go through the return process but needless to say i will not be purchasing from this amazon store again unless this is resolved i ordered this button thinking it was the same one as the one in the picture which is the one i've seen before when it arrived the button looks somewhat different and the phrases are not as funny as the ones from the button shown in the picture i ordered two of these one is ok and the other did not work i opened up the battery cover and found one of the batteries had leaked coating the contact spring with gunk that would not come off how ironic i guess i can push the button on the one that works funny little toy great for conference calls but will not work when you try to put new batteries in so it looks like it will only work as long as the original batteries hold up at least in my case tried multiple replacemnents order came in on time when i opened the package it was dirty looked used and was stapled to hold it together product did not work had to send it back i gave the button that worked away as a gag gift the second one had to be returned because it wouldn't work the packaging arrived with cracked plastic and the battery was dead i replaced the battery and wrapped it up it was to be a stocking stuffer for christmas and by the time it was unwrapped days later the brand new batteries were dead i understand it's a cheap product but c'mon it should at least work for a week before breaking down the one or two lines i heard immediately after replacing the batteries were funny and my dad would have really gotten a kick out of the toy if it had worked i ordered of these for christmas gifts and when they arrived all the batteries were dead buying the new batteries added expense to the gift they are very cute and a great fun gift but embarrassing to give a gift that does not work this was suppose to be a gag gift for a co worker cheap simple now i have to compromise the unopened box as a gift to buy and replace the batteries pathetic really in fact i'm so irritated about it i'm writing a review before i even hear if the gag sounds good the picture shows the button looking like the easy button from staples when i got the item it was a totally different item it was black and looked nothing like the easy button as advertised it was a totally different item this button has about phrases each is different and said in a male voice voice sounds somewhat like a robotic male voice shouting through a bull horn it's somewhat funny does get old fiarly quick though it's something you'd play with for minutes and then give to a friend so they can have a good laugh and then passing it off to someone else as well the price tag is reasonable for what you get it's not an amazing purchase but for the cost it's not a risky purchase i also have the staples easy button the bs button even though it costs more does not have the same build quality or tactile click feedback as the lower price easy button the bs button feels a bit flimsy and a bit loose the quality tactile feel of the staples button gives more button pressing satisfaction than this one the words 'bs' is cheaply printed on the button while on the staples button 'easy' is actually raised tip the staples button costs less if you buy it from a staples store the bs button lights up and gives a few simple phrases such as this is 'bs' or warning warning 'bs' alert with sirens going off it was a hit at first works great when you're with friends who are staples employees but outside of that it doesn't get much use as its humor wears off fast i was kind of expecting the same kind of thing that you get with the staples that was easy button but the stuff that comes out of this thing when you push the button isn't just bs it's a bunch of goofy corny expressions as gag gifts go this is a pretty okay item not too much to be excited about least for me but not bad either it's louder than what i thought it would so that's a plus however i was slightly surprised when i received it the packaging is different and it's a bit smaller than it looks in the picture other than that it's the same item would make a good gift to someone whom you don't know what to get and likes gag gifts bull just a fair warning if you think this thing is as big as a staples button you're mistaken it's half the size fun but half the size i purchased a few of these for gag gifts and after receiving them thought they were monotonous not offensive just monotonous the magic ball is more entertaining and funnier so it's much smaller and differently colored than in the picture but the phrases are still fun and it makes a good gag gift
