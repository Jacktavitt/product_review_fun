bawk bawk this handbag is solid rubber very well constructed and so real looking great fun if i had to change one thing i would give it a larger zippered opening but as i am primarily using this for fun and my hand is small it works i am displaying it most of the time and am a true chicken mother on a farm really cute purse for the serious chicken lover great conversation starter a fun hen bag that i am waiting on my hens to start laying so that i can take eggs to work and wear my chicken lady outfit which is this purse and the hen scarf which is also very pretty bought for my wife we do raise chickens so why not have this right she loves this purse zipper hole is a little on the smaller size she has problems putting some things in her purse very happy my daughter loves chickens this was a christmas gift for her she was so pleased this thing is hysterical it arrived flat and folded but a little time with a blow dryer and stuffing it with towels removed any wrinkles it had can't wait to give this to my mom thank you loved it i have carried it to work and everywhere enjoying it my wife loves it really fun idea problem in the design though the opening was way too small hard to put anything inside the purse and would have to let it air out had a strong rubber smell disappointed because i really liked the idea i love this bag only change i would make is the opening zipper is quite small and hard to fit most standard size wallets a gift for my girlfriend she loves it hehe it s just the funniest purse loved the whole idea but the opening was too small i could not fit wallet so i use as my lunch bag i love this unique purse the only problem is the opening is kind of small otherwise it is head turning awesome it is very cute but a small opening for my purse but that s ok it is definitely a talking point i first saw this bag when i was shopping at anthropologie and this lady was carrying it i had to ask where she got it from cuteness overload she had worn it so hard there were holes underneath the handles i have moments where i love having a cheap chicken purse i believe i purchased it for about back before this purse exploded on here surprised they bumped it to idk if its worth that price personally as opposed to a designer bag worth hundred of thousands of dollars and this purse makes people smile this is def a novelty purse the zipper on the top is kinda small the opening in general makes it hard to grab aroung in the bag might be easier to have pouches in there with all your things in them that way you could just pull a pouch out instead of fishing in your bag with one hand the lining inside is a pale yellow gets dirty real fast black would be perfect out of all the bags i have some designer some not this bag gets me the most compliments even nordstrom sales people love it go figure good quality and nice workmanship super cute i love this purse so much i had one exactly like it but lost it in a nasty breakup i finally found it again on amazon and it's just like i remembered it it's rubbery but fairly large on the inside the zipper is short so you can't jam a large wallet through the opening i get so many compliments on it i purchased two of these as christmas gifts for my granddaughters they were both delighted this is such a cute purse as others mentioned the zipper opening is relatively small but overall everyone loves this purse looks cool i gave it as a gift to my son's girlfriend it was on her amazon wish list and she loved it adorable loved the bag except the opening is rather small never have i been so excited to carry a purse this is the best handbag that has ever existed it s roomy and can fit at minimum a pack of nuggets i feel completely safe with it as who would steal it love this unique purse super cute bag the rubber smell is a little strong at first but airs out fine my wife loves this purse and it freaks out our yard chickens when we set it down by the coup lol my aunt saw this at a wedding and went crazy she lives chickens she will love this as her xmas gift i love this bag i get nothing but compliments and it's water proof this is a nice purse the zipper on it makes it hard to put in and get things out of your purse i bought for we girls goes great with chicken socks lol very cute and nicely made fun item for sure i absolutely love this purse so does everyone else the zipper doesn't bother me as much as it does some great product this is the best bag i have ever purchased love me some hens this bag was so weird that when i saw it i knew i had to have it i work at a local produce stand market and we have free roaming chickens on premises i knew this bag would be a hit it's roomy and pretty much waterproof for rainy days only thing i don't like about it is the opening kinda small also its just one large pocket inside this is the silliest cutest purse that i have ever owned i'm so in love with this purse best thing i've ever purchased my favorite thing ever i get tons of compliments when i take this out well made fits more than i expected i love it the opening is a little small but it works just great super roomy its so much fun hearing all the comments when i carry it fast shipping this purse is great bought several as gifts for relatives in alabama they raise chickens and love them i can't fit some items through the hole but the purse looks just like the picture it's a rubber chicken purse what more is there to say lots of compliments people love it almost as much as i do the opening is short enuf for your hand or looking for something not both lol make sure your wallet fits otherwise it's amazing love this purse and recommend it to anyone i got this as a gift for someone it's really cute and funny it wasn't as bright yellow as i expected and it was kind of difficult to get my hand into the opening as it is relatively small otherwise it's awesome though love this purse wish zipper opening was bigger will order again exactly as expected love this so funny i replaced the smaller zipper with a inch zipper now my hen bag is perfect got this last christmas as an asked for gift yes it's rubber so it smelled like rubber the smell which smelled like new dolls used to smell to me when i got them as child was not bad at all it has since faded the opening is small that is the only reason i didn't give it stars it's hard to get anything out of this purse i took it out in public as soon as i got it even though my sister begged me not to take it and the compliments began right away i have had so many compliments on this purse that i lost count long ago not very long into the day my sister was holding my purse for me and even sat it on her side of the tabletop of the restaurant we lunched at i am not really interested in carrying the same cookie cutter purse the rest of the world has and this purse has put smiles on so many faces yes one or two of them have been mean ones that i really look forward to going places with it this little purse is a conversation starter and just seems to make people happy seeing it so own the look and carry it proudly and just tell them where you got it when they try to buy it from you because i have had a lot of that too this thing is so incredibly stupid looking that i had to have it when i saw it it makes me super happy every time i see it causes spontaneous conversation and amusement to everyone else who sees it as well i have two complaints first the opening is too fricking small which is incredibly frustrating given that it's roomy and so much more should fit in it than does second it would be more aesthetically pleasing if a small amount of material foam whatever were in the head so that my poor chicken doesn't look so smooshed lastly a previous reviewer extolled the virtues of the spacious handles easily accommodating over the shoulder wear even in a bulky winter cloak if you purchased as a fat person expecting it to fit over your arm alas it may not i am still ridiculously happy with my stupid handbag regardless purse is positively adorable looks exactly like the pictures and the detail is great lots of little feathers gave it a because the zipper opening is small and there's no mini zipper pocket inside which would've been really helpful this is the gift for my friend so cute small but really how much are you going to use it i got it for display i think chickens are so cute so cute purchased a rooster charm to hang off of zipper good quality thank you she'll go with me everywhere babs has just returned from her first vacation to the beach with us she was a delight to travel with yes her zipper opening is just short of inches but that just made me feel more secure about my belongings inside and she does hold a lot we took her picture at various locations she does not smell and wipes clean easily very happy with my purchase wife loves it super cute love it really a fun looking purse i did not give it stars because the zipper is too short and it makes getting in and out of the bag really difficult also they stuff it with paper or something because it's pretty flat i'm going to make some sort of a plastic insert to help proof it out people love this purse i bought it as a gift for my sister she loves it it has held up really well can't stop clucking about this fun henbag just too cute this purse is part of my identity friends and strangers compliment on it the best ever great conversation starter gave this as a gift along with the little rubber chick coin purse to a crazy chicken lady bought this for a friends birthday and she loves it she has teens stop her and ask to take pictures with it great bag i bought it for my niece and she just loves it bwahahaha gave it as a gag birthday gift filled it with plastic eggs with money in them it fit quite a few eggs roomy inside would hold a good amount as long as you could get it through the somewhat small opening super cute bought this for my mother in law because she loves chickens and chicken decor can't wait to give it to her i love my new purse i was stopped everywhere i went people loved it i'm going to order more i love it and i want another one i bought this as a gift for my daughter she is beyond thrilled with it it is so adorable she said it is the perfect size to hold her current knitting project lots of fun a bit hard to get into as the top doesn't open very far but it's cute and thick i like it my sister loved it my wife loves her chickens we have a farm so when i got her the bag she went crazy for it the handbag is great quality and thick rubber well worth the money for this unique purse great christmas present love love love my chicken eloise so cute and funny can't wait to take it on vacation this is the best purse i have ever owned i get compliments on it constantly and it makes me feel beautiful and powerful thank you so much got this for my step mom for christmas she loved it quality is great and is holding up still this is the perfect purse for

and looks grea the opening slot is a bit small but that's the only problem super cute this was just want the wife wanted the purse was well made and very like like with the colorations nice product

this bag makes a great conversation piece i absolutely love my chicken purse and with all the little kiddies getting scraped knees etc i use this for my supply of band aids and first aid stuff it always takes their mind off of their bumps and scratches i've also used this guy to carry ice cubes to a party and wet hand towels to a picnic in the woods let your imagination go wild bought this as a gift for xmas i ended up puking in it and due to it's rubbed construction not one drop of vom was dripped would puke into rubber chicken purse again i love this and so many comments when i carry it my daughter in law loved it she has chickens so it was the perfect gift it was a gift for my cousin and she loved it such an adorable purse my mother absolutely loved it thanks my husband got this for me as a christmas gift cause i showed it to him and said i wanted was so funny to open my gift in front of all our guest everybody smile and laugh about it what can i say im in love with it is lovely and plenty of room inside the openning is a bit small but plenty of roon inside the hen hehe love it my only negative comment is the opening is very small hard to get a cosmetics bag inside or to maneuver around inside great gift my friend raises chickens she loved it i love different purses and this is different and something no one would be surprised i carried love love love this hen bag i was pleasantly surprised with how much it holds i love the outer rubber construction which is great in the rain or snow i do wish the bottom was also rubber construct it is fabric i have gotten lots of compliments on this cute bag i really enjoy it sooo funny it is rubber made and you can clean it very easily the zipped opening is a little too short but you can put everything you need in wallet phone a lot of keys kleenex i bought this for my chicken fanatic daughter i am so excited to give it to her it feels very durable the zipper is a bit short but it's not a problem for my daughter i love it i truly do but it lives in my attic i wish i could take this out in public but that's just me i love this purse the zipper could have been a little longer however it actually keeps my hubbys large hands out of it haha i get so many compliments on it every where i go always a conversation starter cluck cluck love the henbag occasionally i'll use it as a handbag if i'm in a silly mood and it is good to used as a toiletry overnight bag as others have mentioned the opening is not huge but i haven't really noticed that causes any issues i get complements on it all the time its lasted through a lot of wear and tear the rubber chicken purse industry is known to be very brutal and cut throat i hear that folks who work in this business tend to suffer from some form of ptsd and in some cases spend some time at mental health clinics i guess i understand the stress since rubber chicken purses are always in such high demand but is it going too far in the end purchasing a rubber chicken purse is basically the same as buying conflict diamonds from africa the straps are nicely made totally fun durable and wipes clean with a little soapy water i don't know it was a present to a granddaughter this thing is cool as hell this thing was just the best put it with a pair of moxy sox chicken leg sox and you are stylin' my friend loved it this is everything i have ever wanted and everything i have ever needed in a chicken purse i love this purse more than i will ever love a child i love my chicken purse and wish it came in other colors so i could collect them all love this bag i've wanted this cute bag for years since i saw someone in scottsdale carrying one the purse sure grabs attention it might not be for everyone but i like the was it gets people talking it has tons of room but as others have pointed a very small opening i am happy that my wallet can fit into it it is a great conversation starter and while a little smaller than i thought it's such a good and durable purse to have it's a henbag for goodness' sake you can't go wrong with that lots of fun reactions it's so fugly it's adorable and actually very high quality for a rubber chicken purse want to stand out in a crowd carry this purse very well made product luv it fast delivery this is just the greatest purse ever i've had about compliments on it already and i've only had it a few weeks i took it with me to go see hamilton in la and they inspect your bags and when i put it up there the security guy just looked at me i said well i bet you never thought when you got up to go to work you would have your hand in a rubber chicken and the security guy just started cracking up the opening is a bit small yes but i have no problems with it and i have big hands and fat sausage fingers it's a great conversation starter and i just love it more than any other purse i've ever had everybody asks where i got this bag it's so fun to see everyone smile when they see it i love this and carry it everywhere i mean everywhere i may have been put on a government watch list when i was trying to photograph this purse one day what a darling purse i saw this in the window at knott's berry farm and had to see if amazon sold cheaper about half price cheaper so funny and so cute i ordered the change purse to go with it total conversation piece love the chicken purse such a conversation starter only problem the zipper has about a inch opening making it difficult to get a wallet or check book out i bought it for a gf it was everything that was worth the purchase she went nuts for it she absolutely loved it ty great convo starter fun to carry i dont think i have ever gotten as many compliments on a purse as i have with this one people love it awesome bag i smile every time i look at it and it makes quite a splash everywhere i go with it got it in perfect condition arrived even faster than anticipated love this purse it's my state fair purse this is the second one i've purchased my dog ate the other so it looks real i always get loads of comments and compliments using it for the fair good price for only being used a few times a year love it this bag is fantastic its fun to carry makes people smile i have had mine about years and use iot a few weeks a year i just bought more for gifts it's durable and holds plenty the zipper at the top is a little tight so you cant open it wide to dig through your stuff no big deal my full size dkny zip around x x wallet fits in and out just fine this was a great investment until she got loose and one thing led to another she ate all the food in my house freaked out my goats tormented the geese got freaky with the rooster and now she's sitting on eggs if they hatch i have no idea how to care for more rubber chicken purses in mini form like what do they even eat what can i put inside of them do they need water quarters do they even hatch with handles seriously the one i got may be a rogue defect she's got a mind of her own and i'm not sure i'm ready for this level of commitment cute though i get sooo many compliments on this purse i love this purse i named it betty and it now comes everywhere with me i love the way this purse looks it gets a lot of attention people stop me to ask about it nearly every day the big con is that the zipper on top is way too small and it makes it very difficult to get in and out of the purse i use this as my daily purse it is a fantastic ice breaker both children and adults seem to love it everyone gets a giggle out of seeing this big obnoxious purse joking aside its actually very sturdy and has held up well to daily use if you want a purse that looks like a chicken this is the one to get the build quality is great the design looks high quality good amount of storage space inside but only one large pocket i only give stars because it does not fill out like this it caves in on itself however it is cute and well made got this for my daughter for christmas it replaced one she had carried for years she loved loves it she carries it everywhere and gets lots of positive comments it's such a fun purse don't buy it if you take yourself too seriously she loved it however the zipper opening is a bit small definitely well worth the money though fun and funky nice handle have stuffed it to rest in the closet and eliminate wrinkles it is awsome zipper a little small i'm all about strange bags lol this one is amazing and the compliments i receive on it are endless the only thing i wish this purse had was a wider opening zipper it has a pretty big area for all your things but if you have a larger wallet or are trying to put anything wider than a in this purse you're going to have to push it or work it through all in all great bag do not regret this decision and i love taking it with me out to bars or social events everyone loves it not as much as i do though i might be responsible for the influx of people that will inevitably be carrying around this bag lol i've told everyone where to get it she's very very cute however not very practical the hole in her is small and i have a big wallet so i can't use her she has a very strong rubber smell too but i love her she's adorable so i honestly didn't know how to rate her if you have small hands and a small wallet she will be fun to carry lol chicken bag love it she liked it because it was very different and not one of her luncheon lady friends had ever seen one although most reviews do say that the hand hole is too small and the straps are too short i bought this purse anyway and carry it constantly it has so much room inside and always seems to get a chuckle from passerbys my purse did not arrive with a funny smell as others had mentioned it keeps its shape well the easiest purse to clean i've ever owned i love this purse it is super durable with my kiddos and under it acts as a diaper bag too not that it is super large just super durable i had it for years until some things started ti break and my mom bought me a brand new one you definitely won't be disappointed with this purse for yourself or as gift for someone i saw a photo of this item on my facebook news feed and thought it was crazy and funny then i posted it on my good friend's wall and got a reply of that's beautiful meant it in a sarcastic way i'm sure then for fun i searched on amazon to see if this purse was offered and there it was we live a quite a distance apart occasionally i like to send her some strange gift in the mail just to let her know i'm thinking of her this item fit the bill and it was on sale for a good price so i placed the order and waited she received and messaged me are you kidding me she then posted a photo of herself with the purse on facebook her friends and even her mother marveled and raved about the purse everyone was jealous i purchased the purse as a joke but i received an update today that the purse made a debut outing with my friend i was so surprised never thought she would use it i'm sure she didn't think so either but the novelty must have grew on her she said people commented on the purse and were very excited the purse was well worth the money for the laughs that we got but was even more worth it now that my friend is going to use it i haven't seen the purse in person so i can't speak of the quality dimensions etc but gift wise this is great i worked at knott's berry farm chicken dinner restaurant and this was my handbag i carried everyone would comment on it everywhere i went the only thing i would change is the opening i would make it slightly bigger if you have a big wallet or other item it could be difficult to get it in the bag love it the only down side is that the opening is a little small but other then that it's great thing to have in my hands it's goofy as all hell but i love it it is so cute niece loved it wonderful i hand picked this to create a crazy chicken lady themed gift set for my wife i was surprised at the size of it and the absolutely hilarious look it is quite catchy looking for a hen bag with that being said it's a bit small for usable space and lacks organizational pockets so it's great as a gag gift but not so great as a functional everyday purse it also has a bit of a rubbery smell to it but it wasn't overpowering to us all in all it's a cute and funny gimmicky bag my niece loves this rubber chicken purse i originally bought it since portlandia is one of my favorite shows and i am in love with the bag it's pretty awesome and eccentric i bought it for a friend as a gag gift but she uses it weekly very nice quality and functional too this couldn't be any cuter or more fun the opening on top is just a little smaller than i would prefer but i really like this bag i bought this as a gift for my my friend who loves chickens and she was delighted i give it stars the only reason i did not give it stars is that there were some tiny black spots on it where it appears the paint had come off or they were markings that should not have been there my friend has taken it to parties in the horse racing industry which multi millionaires attend and she proudly told me it has been a source of fascination julie australia i love this not as as purse the opening is too small i use mine as a cooler perfect for picknicks it's a wonderful conversation piece lots of complaiments the most unusual and comment getting purse i've ever had love my hen bag it's a big rubber chicken and i can't wait to carry it it's really great gave to my sister who has a chicken farm in ohio she loved it so much perfect funny gift for any chicken lover i bought this for my adult cousin for christmas she said it's her spring chicken purse she loved it it's so ridiculous that i love it love my chicken purse i received it in brown a couple of years ago now my husband got it for me in yellow i love it love my chicken purse it's a good size bag well made supper cute the zipper opening is on the small side but i love this purse it'd be nice if there was a divider or pocket inside so everything doesn't just sit together she loved it does smell a bit but odor went away after airing out have bought several as gifts and have one myself lots of fun although not quite big enough to use as everyday purse great to see people smile hilarious it's actually pretty big and fits everything i'd carry in my purse have gotten so many compliments people have stopped me in stores and asked to take pictures with it lol my wife likes any thing chicken and i bought it for her just as a funny gift cute cute fun bag not for everyday but would really brighten up a drab day got this for my mom for christmas and she loved it it is very high quality and looks awesome so cute and has lots of space my technician loves this she uses it everyday i live in a farming community and am always asked where to purchase one the opening is small whish is a bit inconvenient but it makes everyone smile and that can't be said for too many purses love this funky unique purse definitely a conversation starter fun gift for a slight off center friend she loved it great gift love it i always get a laugh when i carry this purse it's a rubber chicken purse how can it not be star seriously if you buy a rubber chicken purse and aren't happy with it when it shows up who really is to blame got this as a gift for a slightly demented teenage daughter and she loved it and she used it as purse smelled like rubber again shouldn't come as a surprise love it cute nice hen bag i love this purse i get lots of positive comments on it exactly what i expected every thing was excellent i love this bag so much so many comments each time i take it on an outing it is hard to maneuver the small zipper opening but i can overlook that since it is such a darling bag it was a gift for a chicken lover she loved it and even carried her chicken around in it i bought this purse mine had the tan handles about years ago while on a trip and it was the best thing i ever bought for myself unfortunately my cat tore it up in a fight a couple years ago and i'm just now getting around to getting a new one i'm currently waiting for it to darken my front door what can i say its more of a chicken than a bag opening small not practical but its a fashion statement excellent items my sister loved only missing the gold eggs fulfill expectation my girlfriend freaking loves this bag i have no idea why it's a chicken bag note that it is made of some rubbery type of material not cloth pretty much every good review on this is accurate the color is more of a light cream with a tinge of yellow not dark yellow has a flat bottom so it sits well the inside is just an empty large cavern with one pocket that is open decent for keys and chapstick i agree with everyone else that the smell is a little strong the first moments you have it but mine has so far died down a bit the zipper is also a little on the short side so if your items inside are jumbled it can be a little harder to find when i received mine it was a tad flattened but the purse will naturally puff out after being filled i'd say a day before the face on mine wasn't flat straps are short of course easiest to carry it on the crook of your arm or in your hand rather than on your shoulder my straps have this tubing in it that sometimes pops out a little bit i just push it back in all in all amazing purse i have gotten so many compliments on it i ended up changing my text noise to that of a chicken cluck just to pull the whole thing together a great success with the chicken lover in my life cluck cluck cute love this bag only complaints are it gets dirty easy and with all the crevices it gets a little difficult to clean slight plastic like odor small opening plastic tubing comes out of straps however the pros far level out those cons it is adorable spacious and the interior pocket is so useful i hate to carry a purse but i love this thing i am so happy i got it people love it too i get stopped everywhere a steal for the cost perfection i bought this for my young cousin she was delighted and made us chuckle well made i received this as a gift on my birthday as chickens are my favorite animal and i strongly hinted i mean begged that my mother might get it for me i am so pleased with it i named my hen bag rebeaka and she fetches laughs and compliments wherever she goes the opening is admittedly a tad small but is large enough for most things that i traditionally carry in a purse i can even with a bit of maneuvering fit a small paperback in there it holds up well and is easy to maintain the overall size of the bag is not too small and not too large i would recommend this to anybody i love this bag it is a great conversation piece or it makes people avoid me either way a win win bought this for my wife she loves it loooovve this bag definatly an attention grabber a little disappointed on the lining i'm nervous the bottom fabric won't be sturdy enough to hold my stuff also opening is suuuuper small had to switch to a card holder for a wallet above all decent bag for a decent price won't be an everyday bag for me as planned very cute fun will make a great fundraiser auction item only thing to be aware of is that the entry zipper is very small would be hard to get anything large like some wallets through it i love this purse it gets compliments everywhere i go i have names her hen solo and she makes me happy great size i can fir my ipad mini my phone wallet and some lipsticks travel perfume pens it's perfect awesomeness this was hilarious my mom loves chickens and this purse was such a great gift for her top opening was very small not sure a wallet would fit but so cute and well made i love this purse so much i named it cluck norris is a hit around the office we even got her a waffle coin purse to go inside of cluck so darling little zipper but no problem very cute but opening a little small but purse has lots of room the recipient of this gift loves it and gets compliments every time she carries it it is actually very nice quality durable and functional you will not find a better rubber chicken purse for the money my life is significantly better because i have a chicken bag th birthday present for my sister in law love it everyone that sees her loves her she's made me famous in our small country town i really think she might make the news paper one day even guys liked her holds alot of stuff but opening is narrow i keep a large wallet and small wallets in her and can still fit a tablet and other things in her love her named her henny hilarious purchase not very practical but i had to have and i love it the only drawback is the zippered opening is almost too small to get my wallet in and out love my chicken purse you can wipe the outside clean with a damp cloth if needed yes the opening at the top is a little smaller than some of my bags but the zipper is sturdy and i can get water bottles in and out without a problem the bag is really quite roomy the handle is also sturdy i carry the bag frequently and people often stop and ask where i found it people may forget my name but they remember the chicken bag the ladies at the office loved it i ended up ordering a second bag to give as a gift it was as well made as the first one hooray for the hen bag got this as a gift for my sister since she's rather chicken obsessed she loved it she carries it around everywhere with her it didn't have any plasticy odors like some had reported too edit april the purse doesn t hold up well if used daily i typically buy a new one every year as the rubber splits and gets dirty and the bottom frey s until now the price used to be and now it s no thank you not worth that price but def worth best purse ever i'm an animal lover and this bag is the right amount of cute and kitsch the red really pops and the bag compliments every outfit from a dress nice pants to jeans you will love bringing this purse with you everywhere as your buddy and enjoying all the fun comments people will make the bag itself holds a lot of items it has a smaller inside pocket for your keys or chapstick and the lighter fabric lining helps you find items much easier which is helpful since the zipper really is pretty short enough for you to stick your hand in and feel around i am known in the town i live in for my hen bag they call me chicken lady people love it and always ask where i got it this is the best purse i have ever carried it is easy to clean and is a good size it made my wife's day she goes out with it all the time a lot of women love it i get so many comments on this bag it's great i've worn it to mardi gras out and about town do you read kelly link the writer kelly link brought this purse to a reading no joke kelly link wears this chicken purse if it's good enough for her it's good enough for me i get so many comments on my chicken purse surely no one will mug me with this purse i love it my chicken purse is sooooo cute i love it the zipper opening is sort of small though so if you have a big hand it might be hard to get it in n out but i love mine getting all sorts of comments and compliments on the downside the zipper openng is a bit small but cuteness is worth it this chicken purse is awesome and it cracks everybody up it brings joy to me daily and life is too short not to have any fun i do agree the zipper is too narrow i'm able to fit everything in that's another reason i love it it carries a lot i just hate having to pull crap out to see in there but totally worth it get it you won't regret it i get compliments every where i go i have never had so many compliments on a purse it is hilarious noone has made any fowl comments pun intended i love it thanku my wife loved it it's a dynamite gift i love it fun to use does have a small opening kind of hard to dig around and find stuff but really cute and fun to use nicely made what's not to love my daughter loved this purse oh boy it is a conversation piece for sure i love love love it can i get another one for referrals i will be showing chickens in a poultry show next month and i will give them the link to buy these great gag gift zipper opening is quite snug or i'd have given it stars fun purse that i will use in the spring it is lined cute product i bought it for a friend and she loves it it looks really cute in her shopping cart when she goes grocery shopping i am going to have so much fun carrying this purse i only gave it stars because the zippered opening is so small you can't open it wide to view all the contents i just received it and have only used it once but here was my experience i live in brooklyn which is ground zero for cool my neighborhood in particular is awesome but is not the coolest it's being invaded by investment bankers who are not cool at all i thought for sure that at least or women would stop me on the street asking me where i got the bag i walked blocks with my lovely rubber chicken purse without a word or glance by anyone granted i was holding it close to my body and my coat was the same off white yellowish color until that is a woman whom i suspect spied the lovely chicken laughed out loud now i couldn't tell if it was a omg that's the best thing ever laugh or a omg what an incredibly ridiculous thing laugh thinking she was a non cool banker i ignored that reaction and continued my walk i got coffee no reaction and then went to my favorite bead jewelry store no reaction finally i was so disappointed that my favorite jewelry store employees and co jewelry designers hadn't said a word that i blurted what do you think about my lovely rubber chicken purse the reaction i love your chicken purse oh my god that is the best not only did the employees genuinely gush about how much they loved my purse but so did the customers apparently the head employee had designed animal purses at fashion school which were shot down they even asked where did you get it i'm looking forward to round next weekend p s love this bag i gave it as a gift to a chicken collector she loved it lots of laughs super fun purse very pleased with my rubber chicken handbag i always get a lot of great compliments and fun conversations started because of the bag the real rubber seems to be standing up to the daily use the opening at the top is pretty small though it's tough to get my wallet in and out of but i will live because this handbag is sooooo my personality thanks for selling ridiculous merchandise like this you keep selling i'll keep buying exactly what i wanted and expected yes the zipper opening is small i have a pretty large wallet and i have no issue putting it in it does smell like rubber its a rubber chicken purse so if course its going to smell that way love it so cute opening is really to small but i love it anyway very happy with my chicken purse conversation piece everywhere i go with this purse people stop stare and gush over how adorable it is it's also got quite a lot of space inside although the opening isn't very large the handbag is as it appears the opening is a big small and hard to get items in out i also purchased the coin purse which is also as it appears and the opening is barely large enough to fit a quarter through these are christmas gifts hopefully the recipient will have smaller hands fingers for retrieving items from within the bags this is a gift i do not like how small the opening is really great purse positives adorable durable lots of space inside negatives paint not even but still good the hole in the top is a bit small so you're not shoving anything big inside but it's good for everyday use overall i would definitely recommend this purse love it bought this purse as a 'joke' gift for a girlfriend of mine didn't think she would really use it she loved it and carries it around as a purse often she gets comments on it everywhere she goes people stop her and ask her where she got it it's very cool just as described fast shipping too i bought this hilarious birthday gift for my mom who's a fan of collecting chickens roosters and everything that's country related whens she opened the present she had a huge smile on her face and everyone around her was laughing my mom brought her purse to work and she said everyone loved it the purse is definitely a conversation starter and everyone wants to feel it to see if it's actually made out of rubber the only negative thing i have to say about this purse is the zipper the zipper is fine but it is a tad bit small for the portion of the purse you can definitely fit a lot of things inside a wallet phone keys tampons and other items i highly recommend this purse for the country girl at heart what can you say about a rubber chicken purse that isn't good nothing i mean it's a rubber chicken purse it's adorable it's a conversation piece everyone wants to know where you got it and it's fun lolz this is the third chicken purse i have purchased for my mother she loves them just wishes the zipper was a bit longer it is what i expected she loved it it's a purse that's also a rubber chicken what's not to love seriously it's just the funniest darn thing ever and looking at it makes me smile i also get comments lots and lots of comments many many women have asked me where i got it in the two months i've been carrying it some ask me to wait while they run and get a friend to look at it i've had a lady just tentatively reach out a finger and poke it at church without saying a word lol in fact i've also had a number of men comment on the awesomeness that is the chicken purse okay pro's roomy very roomy you can fit a lot of stuff in this bag it seems to be very well constructed the materials are obviously easy to clean and if you squish it it bounces right back finally it's a freaking rubber chicken purse con's yes amazing chicken purse or not there are a couple of cons the single biggest one is the opening zipper is kind of small and because of that it's hard to find things in you do a lot of feeling around for what you want i wish the little pocket on the side had a zipper it's kind of worthless without it the handles aren't sewn shut so the rubber hose thing that makes them round tends to try to slide out you see it right away and slide it back but still but in the end i love her yes she's a her she's a chicken not a rooster all i need now is an egg shaped wallet love love this purse i think it's adorable and certainly gets a lot of comments not terribly practical as the opening isn't very wide but worth it just the same the main reason to buy a handbag shaped like a chicken is because it's a handbag shaped like a chicken i don't feel it's very functional due to the really small opening in the top i find it hard to get things in or out of it my mom is going to use it for decoration rather than as a purse i bought the rubber fish one for myself and it has the same problem but who cares it's a fun thing to have when you feel like being silly and don't need to get things in and out of your purse often i think the quality is good and the chicken has a very condescending expression which i appreciate love it gets loads of comments and laughs wish the zipper was a bit longer adorable purse that will get you noticed too bad the opening is so narrow however but i bought it for fun not function this hen rocks the coop so cool what a lovely purse has lasted and my daughter loves it a gift and she loved it this is her second one everyone wants one i get soooo many compliments on this purse great fun the one downside is that the top zipper opening is pretty small so certain things that i would like to have in my purse like a hardback book won't fit but it's sooo cute and fun my new favorite bag ever made only problem i see others said too the top zipper is a bit small making it hard to get wallets ans checkbooks and things out of the top with any ease have had a ton of fun with this bag so many people have commented that they love it i'm amazed i think it let's people know i'm into chickens and have a sense of humor towards life it's a real conversation starter the opening is too small to put much in but it is worth getting way cute what can i say i'm a chicken lover so had to have this purse it's quite roomy inside but be warned that the zipper entry is only long and there are no pockets or compartments good size but the opening is too small at least my hand fits there not to carry something big i bought it for somebody else love it i love it love this bag call it my poultry purse it arrived on time in perfect condition its super cute and can fit a whole lot of things i love my chicken purse i don't want everyone to have one because mine is very special i live in a small rural town and have caused quite a stir the only thing i don't like about it is that the zipper opening is a bit small but i have solved that issue by putting my belongings in a small make up bag lots of space for wallet checkbook camera calendar keys it's fantastic i love the whimsy of it all if you have a whimsical bone in your body or an ironic one i suggest that you get this purse they also come in brown but online it looks less striking as a chicken the details are not as clear this purse is excellent psychotherapy because i laugh every time i see it i have to laugh and put things in perspective i love this purse everywhere i go people comment on this bag cause it's so darned cute the only drawback is that the opening at the top is rather small love it i love this thing i am crazy about chickens anyways but this is just the perfect thing ever i wish the zipper was a tad bit longer sometimes it's hard to get a woman's wallet out but that's the only downfall it's very durable easy to clean and attracts a lot of questions great for the chicken lover the outside dimensions are about the size of a small bowling ball the outside is a rubbery substance but the lining and bottom is some kind of thin waterproof cloth there is one small interior pocket to separate out some small items like a wallet or keys overall the bag is robust enough for everyday use it seems to make people happy to see it and attracts many comments the size of the zip is as shown in the picture and is big enough to accommodate a paperback book or similar sized objects i do not find it to be a problem the rubber chicken hen tote bag was a gift for my daughter who is a backyard chicken tender she loved the gift one of those no special occasion except to say i love you she later posted a photo of the bag on facebook a fun and practical item i love it i read other comments about this purse and the only con is the zipper is a little small but i don't care it's a blast o carry and makes me smile every time someone asks about it love it cute novelty bag this handbag is a fun little accessory and conversation starter my wife got her present this morning and took it to work with her she got so many comments that now i am worried i'll have to handcuff it to her because people love it so much great gift for the chicken loving lady in your life awesome for any chicken lover bought mine to use for chicken emergency bag stocked with supplies in case of dreaded chicken injury smells funky but looks fantastic bigger than it looks super cute to boot bought this as a gift for a chicken loving friend the purse is roomy the handle was a bit bent out of shape upon arrival but it was easy to mold back into place it looked better than i expected so i was pleased my friend got a kick out of itm good products and nice looking i love this bag so much one of the cutest purses i've ever bought at first it was a little lumpy from being in a little box but after shoving all of my junk into it my chicken shaped up nicely i've had it for a month and i'm still in love with it there is a pvc plastic smell to the bag but duh its brand new it's not overpowering or gross in any way it doesn't stink up your stuff either if you don't want to smell it don't stick your face inside of your bag the zipper is quite short but i don't have any problems putting my stuff inside i can get dvds cds my tablet folded clothes and my long wallet through the zipper so absolutely no complaints you must buy this bag loved it sooooo super cute very durable has a slightly smaller zipper opening than i like but overall a cool find i really like it people have gotten a kick out of seeing me carry a chicken purse but oh have mercy that tiny opening if they could just make the opening bigger i know people would really appreciate it maybe not right across the top but perhaps down on the side a little bit as other people mentioned this little bag does not smell as i would normally expect it is really cute but not getting the use as i had planned i did read another's review that the opening was small figured i could get around it can't i have a hard time getting my wallet in and out so haven't really used it much turns out my girlfriend also has one and she uses it as a knitting bag i watched this for months finally caught on sale had already read several reviews so there were no surprises for me here the opening is really small could use a longer zipper but i was aware before purchases i use this for a handbag sometimes sometimes pack my lunch in it when i'm not carrying too big an apple i get lots of comments had a stranger approach asked to take a picture of the bag for his mom to see if she wanted one this item is lots of fun super cute the zipper opening is smaller than i thought but over all a great piece for my chicken loving mom my grand daughter loved it i got one for christmas and she has wanted it since she saw mine very happy bought this for my niece's th birthday she's crazy for chickens this bag was a stand out hit it's well made has great details provided all the adults with a laugh as other reviewers have pointed out the zip opening is quite small best every i use it randomly and it takes people a minute to figure out what it is love it this bag is very well made does not have that peculiar rubbery smell that some products do and attracts a lot of positive attention and smiles item was very cute much nicer quality than i expected gave it to my aunt for her birthday and she loved it i purchased this for my mother for mother's day she absolutely loves it my mom is very fun and social so when she gets in a fun and funky mood i can definitely see her wearing this purse out about town she laughed out load when she opened her chicken purse gift she loves things that make her smile and giggle who doesn't so this was a perfect fun gift for her the zipper opening on top is small as others have said but not so small that you can't put belongings in the purse cavern is large and can hold quite a bit i imagine the small opening could be annoying but not to the point of not wearing the purse it's still a star item for sure this is perhaps the best purse i have ever owned i recommend it for anyone who has a sense of humor or wants to draw a little attention while out in public but be prepared for chuckles and people constantly asking you were you got it from my chicken purse who i have named ms nugget goes everywhere with me and i find it difficult now to go back to a regular purse i was surprised that the purse is actually a little bit bigger then i expected as stated before by other people the zipper is a little too small and sometimes you have to work to get things in or out but that is the only complaint i could find with this purse it is made of rubber but i did not notice any kind of rubber smell because it is made of rubber i would not put anything sharp in it i like the fact that it is made from rubber because i have been caught in many rainstorms this spring and the rain drops just bounce right off it the inside is made from a silky type material and it has one pocket which is handy the red handles are comfortable and are made from some kind of sturdy wire the purse over all is deep and can fit many things it is also easy to wipe clean i have to say i am very addicted to this purse and carry it where ever i go excellent its the nd time i've bought this purse for my daughter once was about years ago she loves it and gets tons of compliments on it it arrived in days only drawback is the small open at the top of the bag but i understand why it might need to be i got this purse as a valentine's day present for my girlfriend she loves it a nice gift for someone who likes chickens or offbeat items the only issue is the zipper opening is a little small seriously the best i carry her everywhere and everyone loves her she's essentially famous now there's a pocket on the inside which is a nice surprise the zipper is smaller which i knew going in but fits my checkbook wallet fine light can pass through the rubber bag which is great because it helps counter the slight difficulty of finding stuff through the small opening love another cute selection have had many comments on it and is very comfortable to carry a real conversation piece for sure this is a cute purse it's a conversation piece and gets attention not the best quality zipper hole on top is small quick delivery with this vendor i love when i get complements from men i like your purse which i response to i bet you don't say that often kids love it too i just thought it went with my last name gallegos gallo spanish for rooster i absolutely love how quirky and unique this handbag is i get people stopping me all the time to ask where i got this bag it's definitely a conversation starter my friend loved it she has five designer chickens so this was perfect for her a wonderful spoof gift she actually used it it came fast and just looks even better in person then on screen i love it and cant wait to use it just too awesome my wife loved it why do i have to say more when i do not want to bite me again a friend had seen this and wanted one so i got it for her it's well made and has very minor odor rubber smell i don't know what size hands those people who complained had but it was large enough for both of us and she got her large billfold in with no problem it's a novelty item but really cute we decided she needed a name so the bag is now clarissa clucker the detailing on the rubber is cute and the handles appear sturdy so for now unless it falls apart we just got it it's a five on the fun scale my friend raises chickens and is called the chicken lady this is a gift for her she will be totally delighted i just love unique and quirky products and i get a laugh from many a person about my beautiful handbag and as i have and love my chickens i am known as the mad chicken lady thanks so much for the easy way to purchase this product i would be very interested in other chicken products if anyone wants to email me thank you i call her count bessie a lot of people complained about the zipper personally for me it works fine it doesn't have a funky smell either frankly what threw me for a loop was demon red eyes other than it's a nice big purse everywhere i go carrying this purse people say i love your bag i say it's my rubber chicken purse lol the rubber chicken purse is so much fun and a sure fire attention getter i love my chicken and he loves me this made my friend's day when i surprised her for her birthday she has pet hens in her yard who just happen to lay eggs too are you bold enough to rock a hen bag if so this is the quirky purse for you i've been put under a love spell by our chickens and was lead by their chicken voodoo to buy this purse now little ol' ladies everywhere feel the awesome need to vocalize their approval of my zany chicken purse it is well made and has plenty of room inside for everything a gal needs while on the go this is just what i was looking for absolutely adorable the only thing that takes a star away is the zipper it's tiny my hand hardly fits much less trying to pull out a wallet other than that i'll probably order the brown one too my girlfriend likes to color with crayons and this chicken purse holds all of them with plenty of room for more i'm concerned about the opening as it's narrow so over time retrieving crayons may be exhausting but it's a very nice purse otherwise she loves that it's a chicken of sorts water tight oddly enough great volume and was funny as hell given as a serious gift was immediately decided that it can be used at easter so since amazon didn't like one of my honest and earnest reviews you will never get another good review from me ever again but i will however write this paragraph each time just to waste your time see unlike you i'm doing this in my free time enjoy pole smokers this silly chicken purse gives me a chuckle and i really really wanted to keep it unfortunately the zippered opening was too small to put my wallet in let alone my beloved kindle other reviewers had mentioned the opening was small but i was hopeful that it would work for me sadly my henbag had to go back this purse is incredibly unique and very awesome i would recommend it to anyone who wants something that stands out only downside is that when it got shipped the beak was smashed so it's permanently crooked instead of straight like in the picture i love thing's that are different and when i saw this purse i feel in love it's super cute in person it's rubber and has quite a bit of room in it i bought it for a friend for her birthday and she loves it i'm going to order another one for myself one simply cannot be in a fowl mood while carrying a chicken purse she is made really well lovely silky lining on the interior she will be travelling everywhere i go this spring so far loving the looks we get while out and about the chicken hen tote handbag was perfect it was just what i was trying to find for my granddaughter she loved it i purchased of these one for myself and one for a friend while i wouldn't use it as my daily purse it certainly is a hoot as a joke type purse i agree with others the zipper is short but when you see the design of the purse it makes sense why it is short i am very pleased with this purchase the purse is very well made and has nice vivid colors i gave it as a gift a year ago and it is holding up great no rips or tears yet i saw someone with one of these things and it's so cute i couldn't resist i bought another in brown which i kept and will give this as a gift to a deserving person i was looking for chicken items for my daughter who is an avid chicken fan and this fit the bill i purchased two of these as christmas gifts for friends a friend of mine bought me one also i am pleased by their unique appearance the only thing i wish was different is that the zippered opening is a bit on the small side otherwise this item is wonderful and i look forward to using it gave the rubber chicken purse as a gift very well received and was fun for everyone there seemed well made and was the same texture material as the classic rubber chicken i can not tell you how many comments all good that i get on my chicken pocketbook people both young and old just love my chicken and they have to touch it one of the neatest things that i have ever bought for myself for sure do not buy this if you do not like any attention i bought this for my daughter for xmas i know she will love this she saw someone with it and everyone stopped her to say how cute it was she really wanted one too i am very pleased seriously do i have to say anything about this look at it it is fantastic no matter where i go with this purse people can't help but smile it breaks barriers lol angry people even get excited it changes people lol i know dramatic review but honest i love this bag because it makes people happy it is so cute i will they would make a bigger one this is a pretty normal size but i like big bags super cute i can't wait to give it to my friends mom on christmas it was a bit expensive though i normally wouldn't pay that much for a chicken bag that i probably wouldn't cary with me anyway my year old god daughter is loving having live chickens in her denver backyard and uses her chicken purse to gather the daily supply of eggs so cute i'm a chicken nut so when i recieved this bsg as an xmas gift i was thrilled carried it for a long time and got a ton of compliments on it it has held up well even with extended use it's very cute the opening is too small only if your hands aren't small my hands are average sized for a woman and it was difficult to remove my wallet from this purse i would keep that in mind before ordering it i wanted to keep it but my family was embarrassed to be seen with me and this purse they were mean about it this is something else you might want to consider before purchasing it will your friends or relatives give you hell over a chicken purse can you stand their mean jibes i thought this bag was amazing it was so cute and i got so many compliments on it it also shipped very quickly and was packed nicely though after a few months of carrying it the seam around the bottom started coming apart and then one of the handles actually ripped off very sad because i loved it but i don't know if i would buy another one knowing it won't last too long maybe i just got a defective one i would still recommend getting it at least once it was a lot of fun while it lasted this is a eye catching fun loving item lots of fun to watch people when they see it some want to take there picture with it jb you get exactly what is pictured the texture is like one of those rubber chickens from a cheesy comedy show holds it's shape nice too love this purse the only downfall about it is the opening to get into it is so small you can barley get your hand inside it let alone see inside it you better know what you put in it cause its hard too see inside other than that its awesome we raise chickens and when i saw an acquaintance with a purse like this i just had to get my own this purse is always a conversation starter at the check out or in a restaurant actually almost everywhere i go someone comments on my chicken more times than not they think she's pretty awesome we took a recent vacation and i made sure to take pictures of it at certain locations i ended up naming it chicken instead of my purse it is also very durable and waterproof the only downside is the opening and the inside the opening is rather small but the inside is huge i do a lot of blind searching for things i have started caring small zip pouches in it to separate my items it would be better if there were a couple of zip pockets on the sides on the inside other than that chicken is pretty cool its a chicken its a bag whats not to like youll get alot of attention wearing this around though so be prepared to explain your love for poultry it's not a toy is a purse love it i get a lot of looks and remarks my husband just shook his head haha i love my chicken purse i get lots of compliments it is starting to fall apart however but only after owning it and using it everyday for over a year now the opening is a bit small as well but makes one just keep a more organized purse if you want to find anything in it that is i saw this purse being carried by a woman on a plane and had to have it it is so cute get lots of comments took it to a quilt show and everyone commented on it holds a lot of items i am thinking about looking for a sound box that will make a clucking noise to use around children i like it it was fun and my wife loved it good product i like it it was fun and my wife loved it good product i bought this for a quirky friend it's hilarious and cute but no one is seriously paying for this are they you can get it for elsewhere be prepared to answer where did you get that a lot i agree with the other raters that the zipper is too short and it smells like rubber for a while it's fading now but it is great fun it is definitely bigger on the inside than it looks if i were to guess you could probably fit or water bottles inside if that were all you were carrying i am not a chicken collector but a rubber chicken makes for great conversations and at this price i do a lot of talking i dare you to get one you too will have a lot of fun i wore this one out and had to order a new one people were asking me where it was still fun still worth the sale price and still getting asked about it i always get positive comments when i use my chicken purse and am always asked where i found it gets attention bought this purse for a holiday party white elephant gift it was a hit lots of laughs and lots of trades to try to get the purse gave this purse to a friend along with the clucker chicken hat laughed so hard that it hurt also gave her a cd of the chicken dance with chicken slippers we danced and laughed until we couldn't stand up anymore she said she wore the ensemble to work and had to sign autographs in the parking lot of course we both work in mental health hospitals fun fun fun perfect fun gift i love this bag the zipper part is not very big so it is difficult to get larger things in but the purse itself is just adorable so i can over look the zipper detail very cute i've had this clucker for only a week and have gotten many compliments it is an attention grabber and i've been asked several times about where i bought it so glad i didn't chicken out in ordering this i used this purse for a pretty long time the enclosure was very small which was annoying but the amount of people that were like whoa look at your purse was worth the struggle initially this was an impulse buy that i held off on for a few hours after i had seen a co worker from another unit carrying this proudly on her arm i kept telling myself i didn't need it but i really really wanted it i clicked that one click order button and never regretted it very sturdy bag such a sweet piece of arm whimsy the rubber smell does fade after weeks would purchase again in a heartbeat great service from amazon as always my mom collects roosters and chickens and it was very cute addition to her collection and if she uses it i doubt very highly anyone could steal her purse if she used it what can i say i got this as a gift and absolutely love it this is the ultimate purse i had already read other reviews so i was aware that the zipper compartment was small so that didn't surprise me it will take some getting used to though so if you're planning on getting this purse be prepared for a small adjustment period as you get used to carefully guiding things through a small opening that said i have a very large wallet and it fits inside think of it as a bonus nobody is ever just going to reach into your purse and snatch something out you'll know if they try and they won't be able to do it quickly your chicken will protect your goodies the purse can hold quite a bit it's a fat little thing with one little side pocket inside when i used it the other day i put this in it a full size wallet some paperwork a nail care case an electronic cigarette case about the size of my full size wallet lots of pens and pencils a knife a sewing kit a comb and brush some safety pins some scissors a oz bottle of soda my cell phone two small packages of candy my keys my medicine a charging cord for the e cig women's personal products a small credit card pouch reading glasses in a plastic case a roll of tape and although the little chicken was full there was room for more it's also water proof which can be quite handy where i live the only way you could improve this thing would be to make it cluck when you squeeze the beak i get compliments on this purse daily and it does hold everything i wish the zipper opening was larger but otherwise i love it the rubber smell eventually became a non issue and was much less potent i had my eye on this for awhile so my husband just said get it if you want it so i did i love it my sister said she wanted a purse for christmas last year so i found this and decided to buy it for her this thing is made out of rubber so it smells terrible but it is the funniest thing i've purchased in awhile my friend and i threw this chicken in a box stuffed with feathers and then we wrapped the hell out of it my sister's face was priceless when she opened it haha this is the cutest handbag or is that hen bag ever most of the bag is made of rubber with a corded nylon bottom and very sturdy handles the zippered area at the top is a little smaller than i would like but the bag makes up for it with a huge capacity the bag comes shipped flat i stuffed mine full of packing material so that it will keep its shape between uses as a backyard chicken owner this is so appropriate and would make a great gift for any chicken loving gal i am using my chicken purse this week ive had a few comments on it from others it has enough room but i wish it was easier to access the top zipper is kind of small and does not allow you to see everything in your purse otherwise very cute saw this online and immediately knew i had to have one am very happy with it everywhere i carry it women think it is cute and want to know where i got it and of course i have to share amazon thank you for having such unique items i bought this bag for my friend and she could not go anywhere without people commenting on it it was so popular that she changed her texting and calling sounds to a chicken cluck i bought this for my year old daughter who is obsessed with chickens for her birthday she was so surprised because she had because she had never seen anything like this she has gotten many compliments on it my only small complaint is that the zipper opening is little so getting things in and out takes a little work otherwise this is a great item and i am thinking i might need one for myself very cute purse you will get some odd looks when carrying this hen bag very fun piece it smells like rubber to the point i had to air it out and place satchets inside before i could carry it the opening is very small making it difficult to get things in and out i also purchased the chick coin purse makes a great addition to the mother hen purse my hen bag is actually better than the picture detail and shading were impressive for a rubber chicken bag the smell is a bit off putting but fades after a few days the opening in the top is a bit small so getting things in or out of the bag takes a bit of doing i carry this bag everywhere and it never fails to get a laugh smile or comment from people that notice it it's a fun fun bag nothing to take to a fancy engagement or is it it's very durable and can fit a lot more than you'd think i get a lot of compliments and head turns my only complaint is that the straps are a little short so it's definitely more of a handbag than anything love this purse i get so many compliments the opening is a little narrow but there is plenty of room on the inside and it is easy to wipe down which i love it is constructed very well too i just love it great for chicken addicts like me i love the bag my son adores it too when he is upset in the stroller i just show him the chicken and make clucking sounds and he starts laughing has saved much time grocery shopping that way also receive many compliments came flat in the mail but once you start using it it plumps up i ordered this bag for my daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it she says every time she carrys it she gets cute comments i can't top the review where the chicken travels the country but this is a cute little novelty bag that i got as a gift for my daughter it's well made and fun i should have ordered one for myself i use this bag for my small knitting projects it always brings a laugh i was going to the doctor for a serious medical issue and it brought a laugh to all of us as i was knitting in the waiting room the zipper opening is limited so it wouldn't work for my primary purse i love it for the comedic value i got this because i am obsessed with odd things what could be more odd than a purse that also functions as a rubber chicken it looks just like it does in the picture it seems durable just like other reviewers have mentioned it would be nicer if the zipper was a little longer i have difficulty squeezing my water bottle through the opening but inside the actual purse it is quite spacious i wish the straps were a bit bigger so i could put it over my shoulder i guess i have to get used to carrying it on my arm or actually holding the handles i love this purse and i get a lot of odd looks around campus but this purse is totally me and everyone else around me seems to love it too i bought this as a christmas gift and it went over big time my daughter loved it she uses it when she goes antique shopping it's a rubber chicken purse what's not to love every time i take this out with me in public i get oooo's and ahhh's from many people asking where i got it plus it's big enough to hold a ton of stuff and you can rinse it off in the sink sturdy rubber and cloth covered handle for ease of carrying rubber isn't stinky either i bought the henbag for my year old sister for christmas and have been enjoying getting updates on the everyday enjoyment she gets from having such a classy handbag best christmas present ever according to her so of course a win for me from her the bag is rubber so it is very durable and will clean easily it is a medium purse size will fit your everyday items but it is not a large tote that you can put on your shoulder and take lots of things with if you want a lot of nd looks and comments about how well accessorized you are this is the purse for you if you want to go through life obscurely and not be noticed this is not the purse for you this very unique item is fun to carry about makes people smile when they see it will sorta fold up on itself when put on a flat surface larger than i expected this purse can hold several items and the zipper works well i bought this for my mom who loves chickens i had read previous reviewers' comments and agreed that it needs an egg shaped coin purse so i made one for her now if we could only add a ring tone of the chicken dance or something seriously though it is super sturdy not heavy at all the flat bottom is nice and the light colored interior helps to locate items inside the only change i'd made is for the opening to be a few inches wider but that's because i like big slouchy bags and the big openings that come with them but the purse wasn't for me anyhow i have been advised that mom gets chatted up quite a bit whenever she takes her chicken purse with her love it i just recieved this purse love it the zipper is a little short but i can get my wallet kindle and all kinds of stuff in it lots of room and not heavy to carry at all it is really a cute bag it is adorable i love it it is easy to find items in the purse because of the light colored interior lining i purchased the chicken coin purse as well so cute saw someone at a knitting guild meeting with one had to get one for myself and daughter in law who raises chickens love the coloring because of the rubbery material it holds it's shape when placed on a table adorable it is lined with a yellow fabric same on outside bottom not that durable looking my only complaint we both love our hen bags exactly what i expected easy ordering and it arrived on time couldn't be more pleased with the overall experience my friend will love it love it but it stinks i read the reviews and thought okay it stinks it should fade away and all will be good it has the oddest smell one of construction worker with no deodrant in degree heat with a side of fried onions in fact when my daughter opened the box and we were passing mrs henny penny around she mentioned that it smelled like burger king i crammed newspaper supposed to absorb odors and a scented dryer sheet let it sit for a few days and it seems to be tolerable i don't carry it next to my nose so i no longer care about the smell although i question if other can smell it as a i walk by because lordy i hope they don't think that is me stinking like that lol d the perfect gift for a lover of all things chicken d is darling an i love it only one thing i'm notcrazy about the opening zipper is so small my wallet hardly fits into it otherwise i's great and very fun thanx i collect anything chicken so this is right up my alley i got alot of compliments on it you can wipe it clean with a damp cloth easily the only problem that i have with it is the opening is to small i had to put a bigger zipper in it to be able to get my wallet and gun in easily i named my purse henry and all my friends family and coworkers know him by name he is the most famous purse in my town i love my rubber chicken purse so much it was a christmas gift from my husband it had been on my wishlist i've been using it ever since it never ceases in making me smile definitely a conversation starter you'll definitely be noticed for better or worse d comes clean pretty easily my only issue with it is i wish the inside pocket was deeper other than that i absolutely love it this purse is too funny and it certainly attracts attention right after it arrived it went with me to the county fair and i lost count of how many people commented on it the bag is well made and has lots of room inside because it is rubber it can be a little uncomfortable to carry on a hot day this item was very well packaged and arrived in perfect condition purchsed this for my niece that is trying her hand at raising chickens for the first time she loved it great big hit alota laughs got this silly thing for my wife as a joke she keeps hens and loves all things poultry she takes it everywhere with her now and gets comments all the time only problem was at first the smell of rubber was strong but that faded over a couple of days fun item and worth the money this is the perfect hen gift my hen girlfriends love it i plan to buy each one for their bday love getting comments and smiles whenever i go out with this bag i confirm that the opening is too narrow for the holding capacity of the bag but you can't let it get too heavy the handles are attached directly to the rubber chicken form part and you don't want that rubber to rip it is adequately strong for a wallet and necessities though got this for my year old for christmas and she is so proud of her chicken purse it's really big and fits her all her goodies that she likes to take around yesterday i found a pair of flip flops in it the opening is small as described but it's not too bad the flip flops fit love that it's plastic so it can't get damaged or stained as she plays outside at the ballpark pool etc so people might look at me weird but it looks so cute in the shopping cart holds everything i need for a supermarket run i love this purse i bought it so i could tote my yarn and knitting around it is large and roomy when something is inside of it and you set it down it puffs up and you get a large fat chicken sitting next to you it is very well made high quality the inside is lined the handles are really secure this is for my sister hen party and i couldn't find it anywhere its awesome its just what i wanted what a hoot this purse is and yes i agree with several other reviewers that the zipper part is not terribly long but hey it's a chicken purse not something you would carry everyday our daughter has three fat hens and she will love the purse love it have had a lot of laughs with it and the only thing i wish the zipper in the opening was bigger but love it just the same this purse has been a conversation piece everywhere we go i also found a chick change purse here on amazon that is a perfect match for this purse funny stuff love this henbag it is as the image showed on amazon com the henbag is quite spacious and can fit in a lot of things even though the opening is not as wide as i would hope for it's a birthday gift for my mother in law her chinese horoscope is a chicken bought this as a gift for my sister who had seen it in a catalog naturally i check amazon where the prices are consistenly better and got it for her she gets tons of compliments on it only complaint is the zipper is slightly short and hard to get a regular size wallet out of it other than that ii is super sturdy i got this bag as a birthday present from a friend of mine at first i wasn't sure where i was going to use it but i ended up taking it to a concert in new york where it certainly attracted a lot of attention i saw this chicken purse on someone else's blog and i had to have it i am actually a poultry owner but i think this is such a fun purse even for the non chicken owner this purse is really well made the rubber is thick and it has a liner with a pocket inside this is a much bigger purse than i was expecting i'm not sure what i was expecting actually but you can really fit a lot in this purse i have gotten giggles and lots of great compliments on this purse everyone asks me where i got it and asks to touch it to see if it is really rubber yes it is a very fun conversation piece i have worn it everywhere from church a girls night out to just every day shopping i'm surprised how many people love it because i just got it for myself the handles are a nylon webbing with a plastic form in them to hold their shape they are really comfortable and i have no issues with the handles i've had this purse about a month now and it's held up really well especially since i've been using it every day since i got it the great thing is if it gets dirty it would be easy to wipe down it is just too cute i saw it in specialty catalogs for a much higher cost i am thrilled with this bag i can even carry make up my lunch and stuff for the gym without worry it is made of durable easily cleanable material this bag is perfect for me i need a waterproof bag for necessary supplies also it is so cute i love the chicken i've had my henbag for over two years and i get compliments every time i carry it since it's a rubber chicken i always use it when it's raining she keeps everything dry i've ordered six of them over the years for friends who have admired it or if they happen to have chickens i've even sent three of them to london for a friend that gives them as presents a real conversation piece purse arrived in good time packed well no problems i stuffed it with plastic bags for a few days to press out a wrinkle worked fine have had lots of fun with scarlett wattles even made her a page on facebook thanks for the smiles this is true i have literally worn out two other hen bags and decided that i need a new one i switched to a black satchel and it is so boring people love the hen bag all around the world i took it to london france and spain everywhere i went people were thrilled it really is a conversation starter and broke down cultural barriers like no amount of well meaning language butchering could anywhere i go whether it's starbucks or a dive bar people love the chicken i decided that since everyone was going to be so nice about it i would get little gifts to hand out to people who found it amusing which is why i got the mini chickens they sell them by the gross and i did not foresee getting through a gross of itty bitty chickens but people love them kids adults men women everyone loves them i receive photos from all measure of situations and geographies featuring my chickens having margaritas sunning themselves supporting mini gnomes etc i think of this bag as a lifestyle there is one seriously bad thing about this bag which is the zipper at the top it's so fricken small it takes a lot of work to get anything at all out of the top digging for makeup is practically impossible it's just an unfortunate function of the physiology of the rubber chicken style but it still is a pain in the butt however at you can not get a better life improvement tool i truly believe that combine it with a taco coin purse since i hear the matching rubber chicken coin purse sucks x was wanting a coach for her b day i thought about if for a few days and went to look up fake handbags this is what google gave me so i bought it put it in a coach bag and gave it to her this chicken purse or henbag is just adorable this is a must for any chick that loves chickens it is a real conversation piece and just fun to use i would highly recommend this for anyone who has a good sense of humor and likes to have fun rubber chicken hen tote bag handbag purse pocketbook henbag this a a fun purse as another reviewer wrote the opening is really too small but if you're careful about what you have in the bag and don't need something in a hurry it works out okay i have prime so it arrived in days opened it up and there was my chicken purse awesome it's squishy rubber like a rubber chicken but it's a cute hen the colors are clean and mellow and the bag is lined with pale yellow nylon and it has a pocket it measures about inches across the bottom and about the same at the top but the top is curved it's about inches tall a good medium size bag the zipper opening is only six inches which seems ok but when you actually open it you're only getting about a inch hole but i knew that from reading reviews i couldn't get my wallet in but it's a big wallet and that's ok because i rarely carry it anyway i have my phone id case keys mirror some makeup glasses water and there's lots more room i love it everyone loves it my daughters were shocked they couldn't believe i was carrying a chicken purse it's so cheery as for the smell it smelled like rubber toys not a terrible rubber smell but more like a toy store it is just the thing if you need to cheer yourself up it really looks vividly and it's useful too my little baby girl loves it it's my first time to buy thing from amazon us good experience a handbag not everyone is going to have tacky yet classy it was bought as a gift for my best friend who collects rubbed chickens this purse made me laugh out loud when i saw it and it makes me smile every time i look at it it is a great quality and will be very easy to keep clean i love how large the bottom of the purse is as it keeps its shape no matter how little i am keeping in it so far it has not been uncomfortable to carry or had any cons except for the small zipper it is good quality but the opening is narrow i get so many comments on this purse and people seem to love it almost as much as i do recently i was asked out on a date with an unfortunate looking guy who has had a crush on me forever i didn't know how to let him down so on the date i carried this purse it was causing so much attention every one pointed and laughed he was so embarrassed to be seen with me it worked now when i want my friends to avoid me or i desperately need attention i just carry this around definitely a must have i received this purse as a christmas gift from my loving husband a couple years ago he did not buy it from amazon however it randomly it showed up in amazon's best sellers list today i will be reviewing the purse not amazon's awesome service the purse is pretty great it holds up well easy to clean rubber and roomy i may not have bought this for myself because of the following reasons which are also why i gave the purse stars i like a little smaller purse especially with short handles i prefer handles i can put on my shoulder the opening as mentioned in almost every other review is small i do enjoy carrying billina around she certainly turns heads when my husband wrapped the purse for christmas he cleverly filled it with plastic easter eggs this was very fun i use one of those eggs as a change purse as i mentioned in a comment i also like to set my ringtone to some sort of chicken noise it just seems like the right thing to do all in all i recommend this purse if you are someone who likes to make a statement with accessories my lunch group is now called chicks who lunch fun way to enjoy the purses we take them to our monthly lunches we get lots of attention love them the first time i saw this bag i knew i had to have it it's absolutely adorable hilarious and quite a conversation starter everywhere i go people stare point grin laugh and ask me all about it it's a good thing gets me out of my shell and yes i get a chance to plug backyard chickens into everyone's minds as a fun possibility as i really love my backyard flock this purse is durable lightweight holds a ton though the zipper opening is small and i sometimes have a hard time fitting things in and is easy to clean i did notice a rubber smell but it has dissipated in the last few weeks of using the bag love it and recommend it to anyone who needs something to brighten their day and others' my wife saw this purse and fell in love with it at first i thought that it was just a novelty purse but i was really surprised at its functionality as well it seems it's water repellant and seem to be latex free i think it's a soft vinyl though i'm not certain which is great since my wife's allergic as much as my wife packs into a purse this one seems durable awesome bang for the buck i have pet chickens and my husband bought this purse for me a couple of years and i love it and carry it most of the time it is very durable when mine gets a little grungy looking i just throw it in in the washer with the towels and it comes out just like new the only thing is that over the years the inside pocket which are made out of that thin fabric has ripped this purse is not for a person that wants to blend into the crowd almost everyday some one comments on it i have people chase me down to ask about it people have even stopped and asked to have their picture taken with it it is definitely a conversation starter love my new chicken purse if it matters to anyone i really think it is vinyl not rubber this might matter if you had latex allergies also vinyl is more durable the first time i saw this bag i was instantly fascinated with it browsing amazon handbags for something different and quirky i came across this i was drawn to it immediately but i didn't make the jump to buy it instead i waited i contemplated it it was indeed eye catching but wasn't too much i mulled it over in my head for about two weeks until i finally decided for bucks no pun intended it was worth the risk so i went ahead and made the purchase and i am so glad i did this bag is awesome it is truly unique everywhere i take it it catches glimpses and compliments this bag is definitely not for one who takes themselves too seriously for me it fits my personality perfectly the only thing negative i have to say is the zipper is a little on the short side it makes it hard to see into the bag and reach in definitely not as convenient but its novelty charm definitely makes up for it in my mind i'd say if your into whimsy this is your bag my brother gave this to my daughter as an easter gift and i borrowed it for a night never had so many compliments and giggles over a purse in my life it's so funny yes the opening is small but it's so worth it i have had this chicken purse in my wish list forever and the ups truck shows up i said to myself i have not ordered anything to my surprise it was the chicken purse my sweet oldest daughter bought it for me for mothers day i called to thank her and we started picking out names for her we settled on the name fannie lou because we were sure henny penny had already been taken we had the best time thinking of all the things we could do with this purse like making a nest for her in the front seat with fake eggs we were just having fun so this chicken purse will make you laugh it does have a strong rubber smell to it but who cares it will go away a some point the opening is wide big enough to get most things inside once inside it is huge i got a lot of stuff in mine first trip out was to the grocery store it was priceless in the milk egg aisle i am looking at eggs honest little girls with their mom staring at my chicken purse looking at me like why are you buying eggs lady their mom wanted to know where i got that purse either everyone in the store were enjoying fannie lou or thinking look at that crazy lady with that chicken purse i don't care if it makes one person smile then it is worth it fannie lou will be with me at the flea market and the farmers market and the grocery store especially when i need eggs i bought this rubber chicken purse for a special person's birthday i'm sure she'll enjoy it and get a lot of comments when she carries it it's too cute for words it's super cute and good sized without being overly large i'll certainly be able to fit all my stuff in it the only possible problem i foresee is getting it back out as others have mentioned the opening at the top of the purse is small if it were just an inch bigger that would've been helpful a lot of shaking and digging about to find what i'm looking for is in my future that being said i'm going to have fun wearing it out i wear simple black clothing of the time and the purse is really going to pop it'll be a conversation starter for sure i was looking for purses and stumbled upon this gem it called out to me i had to get it everything everyone said is true it has a strong rubber smell and a very small opening i love it though i was actually looking for a larger purse for my ereader it barely fits in the opening it is a challenge but then it lays perfectly on the bottom i doubt i will use it regularly though as cavernous purses with no pockets irritate me it is just a matter of time before clucky is bloated with month old receipts i do think it is educational as i had a conversation with a complete stranger on the differences between hens and chickens lol edit i have already moved onto another purse and having a wider opening was so nice awesome funky chicken purse well made and very roomy must have for anyone who loves anything chicken in my mind this is a piece of folk art a rubber one but folk art nonetheless this purse is adorable but small the straps are small and i cant put it around my arm so i have to leave it in the cart while shopping it is soooo cute though i was thrilled when my rubber chicken purse finally came i get people stopping me in public and get the same two questions ''is that a chicken purse '' and ''where did you get that '' even the grandaughters like it and ask if they can carry my purse just to be carrying a chicken lol a lot of fun fun cute good for starting conversations impractical opening to purse is rather small making it difficult to insert remove items has only one interior pocket that is difficult to see into after two weeks the burnt rubber smell is still pretty strong especially if it is in the sun revised review year later ok i confess i just bought my second chicken purse so i must increase my rating to stars the smell does eventually go away completely but it took about weeks yes it is impractical in all of the ways i describe above i solved the problem of not being able to find my cell phone in this purse by attaching a nintendo game boy case to the handle for the purpose of keeping my phone in an easily accessible spot the thing i love about this purse i'm embarrassed to admit is all of the attention it brings i've had multiple people stop me to take pictures of my purse i get comments almost every day when i use this purse people recognize me by my purse now it has become a part of my identity its a fun conversation starter as well so even though it isn't the most practical thing in the world a lot of fun to use as well as being well made i love this purse so much everyone comments on it and it is just what it appears in the picture it is durable and roomy i would tell anyone that this product line is great and that they deliver what they advertise i got my hen bag today i let out a little scream i was so excited its awsome im going to take tons of pictures with it the deatail is so awsome every handbag collecter needs one ty paula who doesn't need a rubber chicken purse that's what i thought you immediately thought of people to get this for pros rubber chicken purse roomy as one might expect from a chicken sits upright ever so adorably excellent construction cons zippered opening at top is a little small another inch would have been nice love it love it love it not much else to say this is a fabulous little attention getting accessory if you are up for a bit of gawking commentary from strangers both good and bad with a sprinkling of slightly measured distaste from your not so fashion forward or adventurous husband he's named it gertrude get this bag this is a unique bag which is good to give as gifts i recommend this to friends who would like to buy some gifts for less than i love my chicken purse i am a year old woman and i love the whimsy this accessory has added to my life the handles and the body of the purse are durable but i am unsure how the bottom of the purse will hold up it is nicely lined with a shiny material and has a small pocket on the inside the zipper on the top of the purse is only long which is on the short side but if it were any longer would compromise the purse's appearance well worth the price i would definitely recommend this purse to anyone who is brave enough to carry it i ordered this really for myself but i get so many people who want one just the other day i was at the mall and a woman asked if she could take a picture of my purse because her mom had the same one and was amazed to see another little kira constantly ask me if they can touch my purse the parents always tell them not to be rude but i don't mind it looks like a kids toy so why wouldn't i let kids see it great buy this bag is just adorable it is exactly as pictured and as other reviewers have shared the bag is big but i am not sure how durable it is or how much weight it will hold also as others noted the opening is pretty small basically you can stuff your hand holding a small wallet in the opening despite the lack of practicality this bag makes me laugh and i cannot wait to carry it out at least at a bar if i spill something on my bag it will wipe right off if you love chickens or chicken related items this is a keeper i love my chicken purse i get comments about it everywhere i go it always puts a smile on people's faces at first the zipper opening seemed very small and was hard to see into the purse but i got used to it fast and would recommend this purse to anyone who likes fun my adult girls gave me some amazon gift cards for mother's day this was the first thing i picked out for myself i love this purse i always get compliments on it too now if only they'd make change purses to match i love this bag i receive so many comments when going out with it truly a unique purse not sure how to clean the dirt off the rubber daily use causes it to get dirty i love this purse it was bigger and sturdier than i expected everwhere i go people look at it and comment on it the only thing i hate is the super narrow opening and the super short handles it isn't enough to keep me from using it because a lot fits inside of it i have just ordered my second chicken purse my first one i've had for years before having to retire her this purse is so much fun if your an out going people kinda person everywhere i go people have to show their friends take a picture of it and or touch it i even have a clucking chicken ringtone on my phone and couldn't resist naming my girls i find delores and agnes quite popular hahaha the one draw back i have is that it's hard to find anything in this cavernous purse the zipper opening is so small that i've considered extending the opening down the bum w velcro not to be weird or gross but for convenience purposes after some time the rubber will start to crack all over especially around the handles from stretching the opening to dig for stuff obviously though its worth the it in the end i saw this chicken handbag on martha stewart's website and i fell in love it makes heads turn most important it makes people smile the quality is very good and has a lot of space this is such a cool accesory out of the ordinary it has a funny smell but this is because the purse is made of rubber and the opening is really small but the bag itself is of a good size people are used to me having an awesome purse and this one was a big hit small opening deep purse and very durable get one there is nothing bad to say about a rubber chicken purse it is genius and because it is made of rubber it wipes off easily if you spill your spaghetti os lol soooo cute i bought this fo my mom for christmas it was her favorite gift and she says that she has never had so many compliments on her apparel she is and resides in an assisted living facility and is the envy of all the ladies with her new purse highly recommend this it is well made roomy and definitely unique just the thing for someone who already has everything i received this purse as a gift for my birthday it was on my wish list so i wasn't overly surprised but still very happy the awesome pros of the chicken purse not highly susceptible to purse thieves it's a bit flashy nice size for carrying objects ex water bottles inside conversation starter matches well with most wardrobes surprisingly feels very durable strong handles nice and detailed rubber has a handy inside pocket for keys or cellphone lined with silk like material and bottom of purse is reinforced fits over the forearm even with a bulky winter coat on for those chilly days when hands must be in pockets the minimal cons of the chicken purse might attract more attention than wanted the zipper closer is a bit shorter than expected and can be a hassle when putting objects like microwave ready soup containers inside but for general normal use it isn't too much or an issue has an odd rubber smell that isn't a big deal and is only noticeable when sticking your nose in the bag and will eventually fade i think so far it hasn't made any items inside the bag smell but when i added a pack of minty gum inside the two smells mixed and are fairly unlikable feels durable but i am concerned about sharp objects possibly stabbing through the rubber somehow overall i am thrilled i received this as a birthday present i did have it on my wish list a great gift idea for someone who loves chickens not me or doesn't enjoy the conventional purse styles defiantly me i almost wish there was a button inside the comb of the chicken that would produce a clucking noise when pressed but maybe that's going too far haha i bought this purse because it made me laugh and i couldn't stop smiling when i saw it it's had the same effect on everyone around me every time i've used it everyone smiles and thinks it's just the greatest bag ever i do wish that the handles were longer it is an oversight that requires you to hold it by its handles i can just barely slip it over my shoulder but it's not so comfortable and an extra on the handles would solve the problem it really does look best over your shoulder because it looks like you're carrying a chicken under your arm it's a riot people at work actually ask me when i'm going to bring my chicken purse again but they have to wait until summertime as for cost a little expensive and frivolous for something plastic but i've had so much fun with it that it's been totally worth it i use this as a purse i get a few strange looks when i take it into a store i believe the hype about expensive handbags has gotten out of hand and i bought it to make fun of the women i work with who spend literally hundreds of dollars on purses ridiculous i always tell them don't you wish you had one just like it this is a great gag gift the zipper was a little short and is not as practical as i had hoped this is a great purse i bought it as a gift and like it a lot love it love it get comments every time i'm out with it it makes people myself smile or laugh i picked up this cute little number for my friend brian d to complete his camping ensemble he was complaining that he had no where to store his lip gloss ipod advil and other small items brian just got back from his camping trip with the boy scouts and harley davidson biker club weekend jamboree and said that his chicken purse was the perfect accessory for the trip he said it was the highlight of discussion and everyone loved it based on his comments i would recommend the chicken purse for anyone who wants to be the center of attention so many high fives possible with these i never have too much time on my hands i can't even explain why these are so funny but they are this is best thing i have ever bought my life is so much better now they say money can t buy happiness but these hands are my happiness these tiny hands are great they're soft and fits well but bigger than i expected i've seen reviews getting incomplete or mismatching pairs i got a set of hands left and right which is great only problem is one pair is the dark version it's not bad because it's still a correct pair but kind of dissapointing because i want them to have the same color the plastic packaging is sealed so i'm guessing these hands are packaged in bulk through a conveyor or something and the pieces are not well sorted as they go through and fall into the plastic if not well there's a messed up process human error that keeps happening while these are sorted which is a bummer cute my daughter has been having fun with these my daughter has had a blast creeping people out with these little hands i purchased these as a gift and they did not disappoint as advertised hands are roughly the size of donald trump's for comparison i had wanted these for a long time and i definitely don't regret finally buying them i carry a pair with me just about everywhere i go friends and strangers love them as do i i bought two sets of these for a coworker after showing him llamas with hats its on youtube nsfw you've been warned and he loved them then he started giving them to coworkers because they like them too i work in a professional office environment and the president of the company now has a pair of them sitting on his desk this has to be the best office gift that keeps on giving i just got another email from a coworker asking for more bonus the guy i originally bought them for is our resident carpenter facilities guy or handy man for short i don't know what i expected so funny bought these as a gag gift for my sister she loved them wish they came in a darker skin tone they are so ridiculous and i love it wore them around the office and was entertained by the reactions these have provided my kids with tons of entertainment making funny videos and little jokes with these is hilarious great gag gift so much fun to surprise people with these are great though i should note that one of my two orders included only nine hands not ten the hand finger puppets where exactly what i wanted i bought them so that my infant child could hold a hand his size while still holding my hand i didn t want to deprive him of an authentic hand holding experience it has been so helpful for him he s is actually years old now and still loves holding the mini hands i would have to say that this product has changed his life because although he doesn t have many friends he always has five hands to hold wonderful product these hands were very life like although smaller which was what i was looking for product was as described this was probably the most genius purchase i have ever made it was delivered on time as well if you think you don t need these you re incorrect great to freak out your friends with small hand phobias livens up any party time to get handsy why did i buy these probably fit better on a small female hand bring them to a party bring them to the bars everyone will gravitate towards your tiny hands girlfriend needs help cleaning the kitchen lend her a hand just watched the best movie of your life hands down love thrift stores me too i love second hand stores all jokes aside these are funny as hell and won't disappoint you best purchase ever what you see is what you get love it creepy and awesome great quality but came with different color hands it s ok for my purposes but just in case you want consist color hands it may not come with that i ordered the same item about week before and the hands were all the same colors creepy and funny to use perfect finger fit perfect i love these finger hands so much weather you are using them to do ten things at once or to have funny and creepy snapchat stories they are a wholesome purchase and are a great find i also love my mini feet that i bought along with it and suggest you buy them to enrich your experience fanasuc product bought this as a birthday gift for my best friend and she loved it makes for a great gift for people with a good sense of humour it came left and right hands great product goes up to random person i don't mean to ask for much just a little high five how fun are these they turn any ordinary task into a fun and funny experience these are very strange and a perfect gift for strange people loved my tiny hands i can give myself so many high fives good quality for the price really not much more to say about it hah nothing makes someone crack up like these dumb things they will instantly lower any person's iq in seconds and that is why we love them i spend much of my day on conference calls with video and at the end when i wave with one of these on my finger it brings the house down have some fun get some finger hands will purchase more in the future because i think they're hilarious these are awesome perfect for petting your cat and shaking hands with strangers awkwardly great gift got sets to give as gifts lots of fun i did get several shades of flesh colors but was able to put together a complete matching set of rights and lefts in the same color then the nd set was a mishmash which ended up going to the young cousins who had a blast the visual imagery is priceless just hilarious bought these on a whim i have a blast messing with people at the office now good times and well worth the small cost bought this for my daughter and she loves them lots of fun these are hilarious i got these as stocking stuffers and i think they were the most liked thing ever i mean it s a set of finger hands what more could you ask for shipping was on time everything was neat and tidy the only problem i had which i m still kind of disappointed about is the fact that i got an uneven number of each hand i got three of one type of hand and seven of the other instead of an even five and five but yeah other than that everything was normal i got these as a stocking stuffer for my brother they were a hit with the whole family they came with rights and lefts there is a slight rubbery odor that is a little unpleasant at first but it's not too bad great product very realistic always a laugh quirky and year olds both loved them in the stockings they smell weird but they came fast and they're hilarious yep worth it my family loves tiny hands so this was a bargain highly recommend to help someone smile for some reason my year old loves them they are exactly as described these were a very popular stocking stuffer this christmas had a request for more so ordered a second set i received pairs both times the best thing i've ever bought great investment for some reason my girlfriend and her whole family loved this i guess its worth it for certain people who have this type of humor so funny i love them i use them to make videos of slime jokingly came with right hands and left hands and all where white except one hand was black we didn't mind at all totally added to the fun of the item absolutely worth every penny if you're considering buying these just do it they have brought me so much joy my cats love them too they love the extra pets just like the ones kristen whig used on snl funny funny funny and they come with lefts and rights it came with right hands and left hands and is incredibly funny to mess around with kids loved them the package of i ordered had light and darker finger hands worked great as gifts very disturbing i bought this as a funny gift for christmas and my boyfriend loved it they are well made and funny to use specially if you want to surprise someone with a tiny handshake amazing they only come in one color though hmm perfectly matched pairs of all the gifts these silly hands were what the kids played with for days my kids are teens and snap chatted the hands nonstop sad but true these tiny hands are so silly and so much fun boyfriend loved them as a stocking stuffer they are totally creepy and hilarious when i got my hands there were only hands because there was a hole in the bag but they are still amazing a perfect stocking stuffer for those people who you think need a little hand the hands r great minus they absolutely reek of pot as soon i opened the bag u just get huge whiff of it if it wasn't for that they would be a just got these in today and have already played with them for over an hour unsettling but fun love them they changed my life love these my cousins and brothers love taking pictures with these lol like the other reviews i also got a ratio of more right hands than left hands but other than that these hands are so funny and perfect for gag gifts i love these i am a so called artist and i have already used the bad boys in several assemblage pieces and i am just so thrilled they look so authentic and they are quite mailable for working into tight spaces i totally caught attention to several people saying that miraculously this company is so stoned that they miss correct amount of left right hands and thus bought extras in anticipation and true to form blessum i got an odd set of pairings no matter just plan aheads and stop your whining at the amazing price for quality stuff oh and i was at some airport and the tsa guy was wearing these at security hahahahahahha so very funny and a great conversation ensued on our omg i have those hands too my kid loves it really funny the guys at modd rzunlimit d have excellent customer service great seller these are great when you can use a little hand fun for hours definitely one of the weirdest stocking stuffers i could think of the detail on these little hands is incredible i swear if you look hard enough you could see hangnails they are almost creepy in detail the only issue i had was the package i received had nine right hands and one left hand not really big deal as these are just a novelty gift and i am still impressed with the quality of them they even come in varying skin tones pretty funny gift hands were as expected i bought this as a halloween prop but i still use it to this day to joke around fun and easy to use very realistic great quality scary to some nonstop happiness to others these never disappoint these things are freaking awesome so much fun sneak up behind someone an touch their cheek with one hilarious i can only give it outta stars though because got right hands and left hands that aside a great product my yo daughter her friends loved these they laughed about them for hours nice but i'm giving four stars because i only received eight hands instead of the ten i was supposed to get so when these arrived there were a few small squares of blotter paper in the bottom of the box the hands arrived in they were in a packet that said 'eat me' on the outside being the daring type individual and having read alice in wonderland and sensing a need for an adventure i ate them all of them i then proceeded to affix the hand puppets to my fingers as shown in the picture and sat back to see what would happen wiggling my fingers playfully about minutes later life suddenly looked ike a scene from the marvel movie dr strange wherein stephen strange pretty much taunts the ancient one into throwing him into alternate realities the walls were melting everything became crystaline shattered and dormammu popped up to offer me a can of spinach telling me it's good for my musckles and an infinite variety of other pieces of insanity from the abyss i looked at my hands and the hands growing from my fingers were growing hands from their fingers much like the attached picture and it just wouldn't stop this went on with me unable to take my eyes from my hands for several days or at least it had to have been days though it seemed at the time to be centuries because i blinked and it suddenly all coalesced back to my living room and me with puppets on my fingers i took them off and looked at my cell phone and it was tuesday night i had begun all this on saturday morning everything looked so i don't know normal except that my cat had ears growing from her ears that hasn't stopped yet the world is a lot more fun now i can say that not for the weak of heart mind or spirit these are so funny our family calls them handy hands and we all get a kick out of them in reality these are a pretty pointless purchase but they do make for a lot of laughs thank you definitely exceeded expectations really cool to have little hands instead of just regular sized one perfect for what my kid needed for a skit very fun stayed on well great party piece or conversation piece i loved these amazing detail i got them today left right bummer hopefully someone contracts me it'd be nice to have matching sets still fun to scare my kids wasn't the reaction i was looking for oh well great fun these are absolutely stupid and a must have everyone calls them my creepy little hands i am slowly losing them because people are stealing them i have painted the nails on one set so much silly fun funny funny funny a great gag this was without a doubt one of the funniest gag gifts my son ever ordered so many uses and a great way to freak out the family pets well worth the money got lefts rights they feel good soft but not sticky they fit well excellent for micro applause one star off for unnatural orange y pink skin tone i have had a good time using the hand it get some really good reactions with kids and adults we love them weariteveryday great little product not much to them but we just wanted them for door greeters welcoming students to youth group funny impression and conversation starter i like others received rights and lefts no biggie just makes you wonder who is counting i love them they're so perfect but i ordered the light ones and got one dark one i wasn't even mad though it was pretty funny my friend wants to trade the dark one cus it matches his skin so it works out shipped quickly everything is perfect and at a great price will order again really fun these are so detailed you can see the finger prints on the teeny tiny fingers someone went to a lot of effort when designing the mold they fit on adult and child fingers and are rubbery and can bend shipping was a bit slow i ordered a case of them for a function but they arrived afterwards and now don t need them i guess i ll add them to the candy bucket at halloween and hope the kids like them or my house gets egged it is little hands they are a lot of fun especially for students if you like crazy crap this is for you we've had a lot of good belly laughs at the office super fun and perfect for those weird nights cracks everyone up no quality issues a friend had two sets of these we had a blast a party bought my own can hardly wait to bring them out highly recommend would buy again these things are hilarious buy them bring them to festivals bring them to a bar with your friends high five people tap them on the shoulder with them share with your friends be the hero everyone needs i bought of these and i am ready to buy more i got lefts and rights so it looks like they solved that issue i bought these on a family trip and they were so fun to play with we got a lot of entertainment out of these things definitely recommend i ordered this and have had nonstop fun with them they serve no real purpose to me except to make fun videos and weird people out i received the proper right and left but i had a friend order them and receive a bunch of mismatched hands so watch out for that came exactly as described prime memes purchased for work prizes for our team building games they were a hit great for a white elephant event a little disappointment because in the questions for these hands i think the seller said there would be five right hands and five left hands but i got all right hands and one of them was darker skinned which is fine just not as described i like it though it's unique we did place the hands in various places around our house for fun it's great i got all and for each hand and i'm so happy love love love these recommend buying them pack of ten five left and five right soft and pliable with great detail serious fun my hands are small i know but they're not yours they are my own but they're not yours they are my own and i am never broken we play with these all the time i got around the same amount of left and right hands thought it was hilarious that they included one darker skinned hand my dog likes it when i use these to pet her i've gotta hand it to them they're pretty nice tiny hands but i had to deduct a star since i got left and only right hands i truly didn't need tiny hands and it's not worth returning but it said so there should be depression cured got right handed finger hands and left handed ones other than that liked this a lot hilarious i received lefts and rights my friends loved this i suggest wearing these with long sleeves to really make it look like you have small hands fun hands are slightly different colors but other than that wonderfully entertaining the hands are beautiful they are a little big for my fingers though and there were an unequal number of rights and lefts i love these so much and so does everyone else who sees them they look so real and it's funny when people get a little freaked out by them i seriously am so glad i bought them yay these are horrifying would recommend ordering this you get tiny hands right hands and left hands i've seen many reviews where they get an uneven number of right and left hands but that was not the case for me i guess i was lucky it seems these rubber hands are made by the company mcphee considering these are rubber hands they do get dirty quite easily and will require cleaning with soap color does not rub off still a funny gag toy the hands are really detailed by the way in conclusion buy at your risk because they might come in uneven numbers of right and left hands the wrong hand color pros hey in the end you still got mini hands so smile fits perfectly and people always laugh i have never seen so many faces light up as when these hands get busted out love them came as ordered and expected very fun gag everyone has fun i like to pet my small dog with these because they fit around his face perfectly too much fun fun funny for many reasons games for kids and adults few things have given me and my coworkers so much joy for so little money you will not regret having ten tiny hands the possibilities are limited only by your imagination absolutely fabulous toy i love the tiny hands so much the ones i got from here were a bit on the orange side so not what i expected but the reactions i get from these toys are still i also expected an equal number of left and right hands but i got right hands and left hands instead my hands arrived earlier than expected in a lovely box and were well protected i would still recommend getting your hands from here but just expect a more orange tinge and a mix of left and right hands these are fun me and my friends goof around with these and put little hands on things that shouldn't have little hands exactly as was expected best thing i've ever bought i've had so much fun with these guaranteed laughs ha ha great for fun photos a must have for any hand to be honest i don't get the point of these but my daughter had mentioned she wanted them they were a perfect stocking stuffer oddly enough i came in her room the other day and one of her friends was wearing them i guess it's not just her she's got these as a christmas present for a friend and they were a huge weirdo hit cheap enough for a one time laugh but fun enough to bring to parties great product i don't know how i lived without them got these for a friend for his birthday and it was a huge hit they're weirdly realistic they have veins and knuckles and wrinkles and stuff but i kinda love that perfect for weirding out your friends received left hands and right hands could have gotten the th star had they been equal so many laughs have been had with these wee hands never not funny i can't help but laugh when i put them on accoutrements makes the best silly things i only wish it came with five left and five left my package came with three left and seven right i have way too much time on my ten hands but i love these so much if i could gift one thing to all my friends and enemies it would be a set of extra tiny hands every single time great as a party favor when you're trying to make friends at a festival amazing quality perfect amazing every one needs an extra set of hands makes great hilarious cat toys got left and right hands just what i wanted came with of one side and of the other looks dumber than you think having two super tiny left hands but still fun and it's a cool thing to toss a younger kid they'll mess with these for hours so fun i have three lefties now got these to brighten up people's day i didn't anticipate giving them out but each person i have one to still has it i'm a highschool senior i needed an icon to be remembered by and this is my icon symbol logol a must have perfect gift for tweens and teens creepy little hands are cool for poking scratching and contemplating life will keep on creeping on so funny i have been so happy with my beautiful set of baby hands i love them more than words can describe one thing was a little odd though it came with about left hands and right hands when i expected an even number for each and it also came with white hands and slightly darker toned hand while i am all for equality i wish there would have been an option for which color tone you could order and how many of each hand but still i am in love with these and wear them literally every day they're so much fun i assure you there is no problem here you will have endless fun in tiny amounts with tiny hands it's the gift that keeps giving so fun there fun awesome even my hands have hands best purchase i've ever made these finger puppets have kept my wayward teen out of trouble and entertained for hours i have to hand it to them they did a really good job with these so much fun endless laughs lefts and rights as expected they freaky and wonderful they did come in a nice package alright no better way to show you are american than using some tiny trump hands to hold up your protest signs perfect for my women's march protest poster keep your tiny hands off my rights yaaaaaas tiny hands are so cute and funny my daughter wears hers as a necklace and gets a lot of attention with it i take mine on trips and take funny photos tiny hand always makes me smile and gives me a good laugh oh my gosh so funny very funny these are the best hilarious to surprise people with and great gifts i bring my tiny hand everywhere and have started a revolution my kids love them the perfect accessory was wary that i might get an unbalanced bag but came with pairs sticker on package even says this is a set do not separate awesome fun if not a bit weird high quality rubbery plastic we gave this as a gift they loved it the only thing to remember is they don't send equal left and right hands so we have right and left which was fine because i knew that from reading up on the product but it's good to know for those who might want to know that information i honestly see these lasting for a long long time the plastic is such great quality perfect for being ridiculous and creepy too ten plastic hands that fit on your fingers just like they say they are just one provides hours of entertainment and giggles to people ages through i have sent hands in care packages to my friends and they love these love love love them i also got left and rights so i was very happy exactly what i needed in my life i received of each type of hand these are great and my kids loved them in their christmas stockings a weird and entertaining novelty gift best gift to myself ever these are a hoot lots of laughs here at the office learning center my kids absolutely loved them some even put a whole punch in it and put on their keychains awesome i love these they are so hilarious and i scare people all the time because they don't expect it i think they are funny and cool i guess the hands are funny to look at and great quality my only complaint is that there were more left than right hands shipped fast and was exactly what i wanted i ended up getting six left hands an right hands but oh well these are so much fun so much fun tiny hands are a particularly appropriate gift these days is there great had a lot of fun with these the items are exactly what i expected came with white right hands white left hands black right hand black left hand hilarious white elephant gift all the kids loved it great fun came in super fast friend absolutely loves using these during class to play pranks on teachers recently my cat has had problems sliding around on the tile after attaching these to lady butterscotch it gives her the perfect traction purchased as a way to increase productivity of my employees i was pleased to learn that hands were included in the set fold increase in throughout was achieved after the purchase of miniature keyboards i am putting on all ten of my tiny hands so i can give these hands a huge round of applause hilarious put them on in class when you raise your hand s to really show your teacher that you know your stuff give a big big wave to your friends so many uses good wish i have five of each hand but i got eight of one hand and two othe the other the ten finger hands puppets are amazing my young daughter ask me for them after a snapchat and i said absolutely she's a pianist and she brought the hand out for her piano teacher and stated we got this they are incredible funny i mean seriously perfect for anyone who wants a little bit of fun having noticed that the listing stated ten finger hands but didn't specify left right along with reading several reviews that mentioned unequal pairing of left and right hands i purchased two packs of ten hoping to make up one full set of tiny hands left right to give as a present the first package contained x right hands x caucasian x poc the second package contained x left hands and x right hands of which x caucasian x poc in total i have six full sets of tiny hands containing a left and a right and eight standalone right hands loved the inclusion of poc hands although they don't make a matching pair just two right hands the hands themselves are hilarious they seem like good quality durable material and have nice detail making them look more realistic the holes are a good size for adults but might be a bit big for younger kids all in all not disappointed and looking forward to the joy these tiny hands are bound to bring awesome little hands these are amazing it's so adorable omg these are so funny i'm so glad i bought them i received right hands and left hands perfect noice i ordered sets of these hands thinking i would get pairs in each set there were several more r hands than l in each package and since i was giving them out as a pair of hands i didn't have enough if they were packed as sets of hands they would have gotten stars deplorably small hands in a basket halloween humor seriously one of my best purchases ever these things are so funny only complaint is that you don't get lefts and rights these are as you'd expect we wanted them for fun purse props on vacation we are going on the only minor complaint is that i received left hands and right hands so they didn't match up but it doesn't say in the description that you will get and so i can't complain these are hands down the best additions to my office desk at work that i think i've ever had and i have to hand it to the manufacturer i give 'em a high for their product my co workers really appreciate it even more now when i give them a little hand on a project ok oddly fun and satisfying these things are strange yet fun join the fingerhand movement for all the times you wanna piss off your cat these are my favorite thing in the universe

have been surprised how useful these little hands are i ordered another set because some of my friends needed a hand so i gave them one they're fun amusing and easy to carry around they're great for little diversions and a great source of puns the problem is the increasingly rare left hands if you lend someone a hand make sure it is a right hand they're easier to replace that one day i can make videos with tiny hands that match my skin color these were awesome for making a video this is what a tiny hand would look like if it were shrunk by wayne szalinski in the blockbuster sold out not straight to vhs movie honey i shrunk the kids these are very realistic also i got a bunch of left hands maybe because most people got right hands and all they have left are a lot of left hands who knows wayne szalinski knows love them good quality thick so they haven't broke yet despite rough play by my year old and his buddies a funny toy great laughs at a family gathering despite them saying i'd onky get right hands i got three left hands but who cares i have creepy baby hands people at the halloween party loved these this met all of my wildest dreams and more do you guys know what kind of freaky stuff you can do with these freak nasty stuff show somebody you love them and buy some finger hands today for what it is it's good quality i thought they would be made of thinner material happy with the purchase i bought this for my brother he really loved it works great great quality it was at an afforadable price thank you this is a gift nice turntable but needs better speakers despite of many negative reviews of this product i still took the risk of buying and thank god i did it was a wonderful super cute product the product is superb on its price i use it in our living room and surprisingly the sound is good and loud enough to enjoy for those asking the voltage of the adapter it is a dual voltage that can be used in any country it can be used both v and v you will never regret this product you will love it as described amazing product arrive on time these are very high quality materials they are very appropriate very patient and helpful this is amazing fast and in time the old one has been broke in my family it really is a good price for the product your getting very kind and the best seller these are very good but by contrast they are quite powerful but they look good feel good moderate shape great quality my daughter loves this to tote around and listen to records old style i think it is more of a fad then for critical music listening we enjoy it daughter in law loves it it still works perfectly and i've had it for a year now you can close and latch it but not with a record in it it has a setting to stop automatically when it gets to the end of the record these are great little record players you'll find a lot of people dis the quality of the sound on them but they sound just fine really do you expect incredible sound from vinyl for no i bought this to play records and it does that very well if i wanted to spend on something that plays them incredibly i would but i'm not going to decent portable little record player it can be hooked up to more powerful speakers for better sound works great simple super adorable the plug is a bit big and heavy while the wire is prettt flimsy but i've never had any problems with it but i hardly move it from my side table the record hangs off the side a bit more than shown in photos but still adorable and simple for having a handful of records would not recommend if you're a serious record collector or wanting to be one there seemed to be quite a few bad reviews about it not working but i picked up mine and there is nothing wrong with it at all the speakers are not too loud but when just having it in one room it's perfectly fine would recommend this one have it for over a year now and it is awesome pair it with your favorite record and you will not regret it it fits anywhere and gives your home a fancy look while being very useful grand daughter loved it love the record player but wish it was louder fantastic value love it the needle still works after a year however it collects dust really fast i would recommend a different color sounds just like my vintage portable record player i had when i was a little girl it's a record player not an mp player if you want pure sound download the music its lightweight comes with a built in adapter and does it's job i didn't purchase at amazon love that it's portable so i like to take it from room to room the sound quality is decent cheesy but fun its a fad cool machine my daughter loves this thing works great great wow in love sound quality is excellent packaging was perfect i've had this record player for over a year now and i absolutely love it the color is absolutely beautiful and it was more than i expected i've had no problems with it since i bought it this a wonderful record player i highly recommend it nice little record player works very well definitely will be getting lots of use speakers could be louder but besides that amazing such a cute compact design functions perfectly and the sound really isn't too terrible for how small it is worth the money bought for my daughter for christmas she loves it some records play a bit too slow given that this is a pretty inexpensive player the quality is better than i expected it's a good buy for amateur vinyl enthusiasts great quality for the price this item is fantastic it was a gift and a big hit great purchase love it i love this record player it's fairly priced and a great size my only complaint if it doesn't seem very stable pieces have fallen off of mine and i've had to reconstruct a few parts other than that the sound is decent and the size is perfect for the small space i live in gift for granddaughter needs speakers with more power i gave it to my daughter for christmas and she loves it this was a christmas present last year to my eldest daughter age and she loves it i got this for my year old grand daugther for christmas she was surprise when she open the gift she was asking for one and she didn't esxpect to get it it really met her expectation i am glad i order this and happy that it was delivered on time for christmas the price was reasonable its a good record player i enjoyed it i mean it really is the price you pay for i imagined something way better but this is my first record player so i wouldn't really know overall this is an amazing record player and does give a vintage vibe totally recommend this is a nice product the sound quality is good it has that old record style sound the speakers aren't very loud on their own but it plugs right into more powerful speakers and works great my brother loved it thanks so much great so far so good my records from the 's and 's even sound good on it as well as newer records i've had it about a week so i don't want to say anything prematurely but its awesome so far good bluetooth also speakers sound good to me perfect for a small room love it sound not good my year old granddaughter loves it i've had this record player for a few years now and it's still a great addition to my living room the sound quality isn't great and it doesn't get terribly loud but you can connect other speakers to it the sound quality got poor about a two years in but a new needle from crosley fixed the issue i would recommend this purchase for the first time vinyl collector could be louder but it gets the job done perfect good item i read some bad reviews after i ordered this doh fortunately i've been loving my crosley cruiser i hooked it up to my stereo speakers with an rca cable and the sound is great good price good sound don't let sound snobs dissuade you if a few months from now i change my mind i'll be back to update i love my record player as expected i'm very pleased with this record player an i know my daughter is as well she received it on her birthday a month ago an has not stopped playing it no problems at all her only complaint is she wishes the speakers were bigger louder this was a gift for my step daughter and she loves it it works very well and has lasted a very long time affordable and well worth what you will spend on it sound quality is great even better than the old style record players cool daughter will love this gift so can i plug my phone into it and play music that way my daughter's birthday gift we were very happy with the quality of sound and the portability i would definitely buy another very good quality item just as described before i start let me say that the crosley record player is considered by many a beginner record player with this being said this record player is absolutely fantastic for the value it has a great sturdy build and is a great centerpiece for any room as it is super easy on the eyes the only pitfall with the player is that it can get some belt problems which can be easily fixed the built in speakers are sub par but this can be fixed by auxing the sound to an external speaker if your absolutely new to the world of record players this is a great choice product as described love it was great i love this record player packing was great nothing damaged this was a gift for my daughter she loves it she brought it home from college to listen to her music i love it that vinyl is back i bought this for my daughters nursery high quality and easy to use the price was the only thing holding me back but it was worth it super cute sound quality isn't great would recommend getting another stereo for it awesome brought back memories reading other reviews i did not expect much from this turntable once unpacked i plugged it into my home stereo receiver and tried out a few records i recommend using external speakers if possible since the on board speakers are small and you are listening to vinyl the reason i am giving stars is that this unit is very light and the switches could have a stronger more friendly design the briefcase top also comes very close to the bottom of the playing album while it did not rub on the albums i have played an older warped album may strike the lid when spinning so use caution if you are playing a lot of vintage records has a hard time with newer lps skips overall good product though really awesome product especially love the color was actually the main factor for me clear smooth sound it could be a bit louder if you want it to be heard outside the room but nothing a set of speakers can't fix would be cool if it could play without being connected to an outlet but the cable is detachable so that's cool can't have everything you can connect your phone too overally satisfied and would recommend good worked flawlessly and looks great wish the speakers were louder though bought this as a high school graduation gift for my girlfriend's sister for her new dorm room she loved it i would consider this a beginner's turntable for those who are interested in getting into vinyls overall was satisfied with the purchase retro is all the rage for the young so i bought this player for my year old daughter who wanted to listen to my old albums and s she is having a blast the retro look is also fun for her and her friends and the sound is okay for the price the only reason i didn't give this stars is i wish there were a mechanism for placing the needle arm on the record it has to be done manually i am not at all an expert when it comes to turntables but i thought it would be a fun thing to have i read a lot of reviews saying that this was a poorly made product that was a waste of money and not worth buying if you're just looking for a turntable to have for fun this can be a great option it's also very small so it's easy to store and carry the turquoise color is adorable and has a very retro feel to it i didn't have any problems with the needle not having enough weight on it to play you do have to be careful when moving around the turntable when it's playing a record if you jump or make a lot of movement it can make the needle jump a little but that's the only problem i have found with the needle i do wish it came with a usb port to plug in my own music but i can't complain too much since that would defeat the purpose of the turntable itself i think the sound is great and i had no problems with the quality of the sound overall i think it's a decent record player for the price if you are looking for an introduction to records i got one for christmas a couple years back i have it plugged into the line in of an old tube radio and use it to play old s that i have accumulated from the thrift store it has a nice air of nostalgia to it when audiophiles choose to listen to vinyl however they're typically looking for the absolute best sound production that they can get and spend big for the privilege on both their equipment and music this unit is definitely not suited for that if you're like me though and have a collection of old records up in the attic or want to pick up some on the cheap and have a listen now and again without spending a fortune then this honestly isn't a bad choice and it looks cool too if you're planning on trying to get high fidelity or want to play expensive and or rare mint condition records then this is sure to disappoint in short it is what it is don't try to fool yourself bought this for my daughter and she loves it it has built in speakers that are great awesome player top quality seen and heard not the highest sound quality but for the price this is a perfect starter all in one record player great seeing vinyl records on the market is quite nostalgic my year old wanted a record player and the crosley cruiser is perfect the design and color are adorable it works great and it's perfect that it's portable i read these reviews when deciding to get the record player or not this is my first record player so im no expert when i got i was so excited i put my melanie martinez vinyl on and at first i didn't realize anything but it kinda sounded weird like a deep sound so i panicked but after a while it just fixed itself some people say the volume is to low but i think its perfect definitely get it if this is one of your first record players but maybe is your used to more expensive fancy ones then dont this is so cute it's not as loud as i was expecting but i didn't purchase it for that reason so it didn't bother me i really love the vintage look and it looks great awesome good sound quality for this tiny adorable cruiser we've had this for close to three years still sounds great the size makes this very convenient guests are always impressed by this thing we listen to it almost every other day the only complaint is the top inside is a felt like material and it likes to collect dog hair but it doesn't bother me enough to take away a star bought it for my granddaughter's th birthday and she loved it so pleased with this record player bought it for my daughter for her birthday and we all love it great i was so hesitant to purchase this after some reviews but i did anyway i love this machine it suits my needs to the t the volume is superb on my record player i have it in the bedroom i dont need to turn the knob much for good volume the only thing i wish was that they fixed the lid so you can lay it down flat without it hitting the record however i am not too bugged by this since i rest it on the wall i am happy with this purchase came perfectly packages without any flaws pretty sweet lil record player bought for my woman and she loves it speakers not the best but listening on the fly they suffice i just bring the rca cables with and plug into any speaker this was incredible i was very reluctant reading some of the amazon reviews but decided to go ahead my sister wanted to listen to our grandmother's very old records we put on the first record beautiful clear music i was ecstatic what i expected to hear was scratchy tinny music instead it was clear and lovely it works well easy to tote around and has wonderful sound had this for about a year and it is still working great looks adorable as well very good works great super cute i love it looks nice but sound could be a little better my granddaughter requested this for her birthday i had no idea this type of phonograph was so popular again she loves it of course it is not the big stero type set up that was so in in the late 's but it is the typical phonograph that i had as a teenager it works well serves the purpose that she wanted it for and is worth the price that we paid i still have about record albums from the 's that she can play my daughter loves her record player she doesn't uses it every day but it's held up pretty well i love this player as someone who is really just starting to collect vinyl it's perfect for my needs i would definitely recommend it for someone just just starting out like myself or if you need something portable to get very much volume additional speakers are needed i understood that when purchasing so doesn't change my review of the product love it this was a gift pricing was competitive to retail stores recipient loved it best ever a got this for my daughter she's a record fan and loves it just wish the speakers were louder so she can truly enjoy listing to albums nice product good quality this is amazing sounds so wonderful and works great super easy to use love the color and the vintage look of it well this has been on every day since it was received no complaints i love my crosley cruiser turntable i have played several records on it so far and have not had the skipping problem the sound quality is decent i plan to later save up and invest in a better quality turntable but overall i think this is a great starter for the price and perfect for someone who is just getting into vinyl this was bought as a gift for my granddaughter and was worried if she would really like it when she opened it she was very happy and when we put the first record on it we all loved it the sound is awesome even when we played some of my older records i would recommend this to anyone fastest shipping ever and yes the product shipped safely i love my cute little record player its lightweight and portable i can also use an aux cord to play music from my phone and i love the suitcase look i didn't give it a because the volume of the speakers doesn't go very high and i don't like how half the record is kind of hanging off the turntable because it is so compact it is a great looking basic record player perfect for someone new to vinyl the color is also true to what i saw in pictures love my aqua version my daughter loves it she is smart with good taste in music and music related items just like her mother and i honestly though i was scared of buying this because of the reviews but to be truthful it's not bad at all the records sounds good the only thing is that the speed has only three setting and that kinda bothers me but it's ok so far it's so good no skipping no problems at all got this as a christmas present for my mother funny enough she got me the same thing both work extremely well i'm an old school kind of person and grew up using record players i had some of my mom's records and nothing to play it on i seen few of my friends with these and thought it was the coolest thing i have had on my wish list for a while and my babies daddy finally got for my b day i love everything about this great sound quality and color is exactly as pictured nice quality it looks very cute and suits people who will enjoy a old but yet modern style the sound is decent and doesn't crack or have static which is a plus overall i'm glad i received this as a gift from my friend people were commenting that the needle doesn't go all the way down onto the record but so far i've not faced that problem when i do i will definitely use that quarter trick my daughter loves this got this from another source but it's the exact same thing excellent for the price has rpm insert and plays and rpm has a flexible pad for the records to sit on speakers are ok for small ones but i string it to my sangean radio and it sounds very nice no problems with packaging or the tonearm or skipping have tried it with very old records from my university's library and they sound new maybe i should have paid another or so for a better player but the size and usability of the crosley are hard to beat plus its retro design is great player so much like ours when we were teens yr old grandson wanted to hear our old albums so made for a great birthday gift he loves it sound is better than we remember and addition for adding speakers is great thanks for prompt delivery it's light weight and very soundly built the sound quality is amazing and i have enjoyed many records in it already i would highly recommend this product not a high quality machine however works great for price could be better but can't complain with the low cost so excited to hear the lp needle mighg need weighted down to prevent skipping a wonderful gift i got this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it the design is as beautiful as it looks this is his first record player and it's a great one at that the sound is great and it's easy to set up and for the price it can't be beat it was just what i was looking for this mad a great present for my millennial daughter the color is nice and the nostalgic styling is perfect for her house the sound is not bad either built in speakers are trash but a decent sounding turntable for casual listening amazing bought this for my girlfriend who has a huge record collection i half expected this to be kind of a cruddy unit but turns out its amazing we use every day the only thing thats bummy is the speaker isnt so good but we connect ours to our sound bar and its perfect thank you crossly my daughter is very happy hi if i buy there is any discount cute and fun for my hipster sister she only listens to records good excellent record player for a preschooler sound can't compare to bose or klipsche but sounds pretty great none the less vinyl is where it's at and this retro player just makes me feel groovy has a great sound might need one in every color this is awesome i recently just started collecting vinyls since it is all we listen too when me and my cousins were kids thi is great product at a very reasonable price awesome works great love this record player the look and the sound easy to work and within seconds you can play your favorite music the selection of records out there is still enormous classics and new music is available too i highly recommend this product fantastic i was extremely surprised with the overall quality of this the build quality is top notch nothing felt cheap or flimsy at all all the buttons felt great and feel like they were made with premium materials perhaps the biggest surprise was the sound quality it surpassed my expectations by a wide margin it's not the loudest but the overall clarity was amazing the audio quality out of the aux output was great as well ii highly recommend this i am very happy with my new record player lets be honest folks nothing beats vinyl wish they made it a little more sturdy less plastic but hey it's so wish in hand but i digress it really is a good record player portable and very cute my daughter loves it perfect this is an awesome record player we got it for my daughter for her birthday she wanted to start a vinyl collection the size is perfect it folds up like a little suitcase for easy transport the color is absolutely adorable the sound quality is great when we have a record on we can hear it throughout the house if we want to belt driven portable turntable with np needle manual return tone arm plays speeds and rpm records dynamic full range stereo speakers rca and headphone jack outputs love the rich warm sound of vinyl but wish it was a more moveable music format put down the ipod and mobilize your music with the crossley cruiser three speed portable turntable constructed of wood and bound in a leatherette material the briefcase styled record player is lightweight and easily transported from place to place it features built in stereo speakers so you can listen to your music without having to connect it to a speaker system cruise over to a friend's house and experience vinyl's superior sound together very retro very nice sound plays all three speeds makes a nice gift if you are looking for something of highest quality then this product isn't for you but it's great for beginners just getting into vinyls i had been wanting a record player for a really long time and i'm so glad i finally splurged and got this one it's affordable easily portable produces a great sound and looks awesome i absolutely love the turquoise color i also like that there is a headphone jack and outputs for hooking up external speakers the latch keeps the case securely closed there are rubber grips on the bottom to keep it from sliding off of slippery surfaces and it comes with an attachment so it can play s my only complaint is that there is a small spot on the outer casing that got nicked during production or packaging see rd photo it was there when i took it out of the box but it's so small it's not really worth going through the hassle of exchanging it for a new one overall i love this record player and definitely recommend it if you're looking for something small and affordable retro and brings back memories my teenage daughter loves it great honestly the best thing ever i couldn't be happier i absolutely love this it is the best it is super cute and perfect for travel because you can secure the arm before travel it comes with one needle and you can plug in headphones but what's the point you have a record player i listen to it everyday im not new to portable record players for bucks this is one fine product i see a lot of bad reviews but i have no complaints i had the crosley playing for hours with different records ranging from soft to a little harder it played them all fabulously i have had no problem with skipping but if you do there are easy fixes for it toss a weight onto the arm and youll be good i had ordered it in turquoise and it is lovely the sound quality isnt bad either not extremely loud but loud enough if you're looking for something incredible youll probably be spending upwards of dollars on one thatll have no flaws but for the price of this it makes a unforgettable gift or experience awesome sound love this turntable cute and good sound this was a gift for my niece who likes retro things it's very cute portable and reminds us both of wes anderson daughter loves it sound is not the best but you can plug external speakers and problem solved bought this for my daughters birthday she loved it just as advertised nice product and sale and shipping went smoothly speedy delivery and great sound compact bright color and can get quite loud i would recommend this to a friend for the convince of being able to take this from room to room i like this product it's a bit wobbly and i wish there was a battery back up option but it's a cute little player you might want to get speakers if you will be using this as your primary turntable the clip that locks the needle down when not in use broke so that could use some shoring up in the next model but all and all i'm happy with this little machine i've had these two records in my posession for almost seven years and i finally ordered this record player so i could listen to them i feel so in touch and in line with myself and my music when it comes out this way it's beautiful it's perfect especially if you don't want to drop and you aren't a huge audiophile just do it great product smaller than i expected but that's makes it easier to transport great sound quality it's a cute turntable and is easy to transport the only thing is that it isn't very loud and the faux leather feels kinda cheap also when i play my records the turn table makes a fuzzy clicking sound every time but it's not super noticeable bought this for a friend for christmas he's a a guy who has everything he and his wife both told me it was their absolutely favorite gift a smash hit stars only because of slightly low volume it's great for someone just getting into records as well as super light weight and portable perfect for a college student living in dorms love this in every way works great for what it was made for this thing is amazing i am a newbie to the turntable world and this crosley cruiser has been just perfect i like that you can close the lid and store it out of the way when needed very convenient i like to hook this up to my mini speaks and blast tunes in the kitchen great starter she loved it it's so cute and small i wish it was a little louder but there are places to plug in a speaker so that shouldn't be an issue it is perfect for me i love this modern little portable i got it quick and saved by buying on line great gift daughter loves the player thinks its neat who would of thought records would come back granddaughter says it has very little volume i've been using my record player for a couple months now and absolutely love it and it looks just as good as the picture shows love love love this i use it every weekend sounds great volume is nice for my space works great awesome not the best in terms of sound quality but i gotta give props to the design and durability great great product great service i'm very pleased with my purchase bought for my daughter and i thought it sounded good also it was super cute looked online a bunch of places and this was the best rated product in this price range very nice product it works precisely as it was advertised i couldn't be happier bought as a gift recipient elated purchased this for my teenage daughter who was looking to play records or vinyl as she refers to them the player works great and she uses it daily the retro colors are cool even a teenager will love it absolutely love it awesome great sound great price i just received my crosley in the mail today it was packaged extremely well to avoid any mishaps and as for the whole stuck lid butter knife thing mine came wrapped in plastic that fed through the crack between the base and lid into the actual player so i had absolutely no issue opening it the speakers work wonderfully for my room and i actually prefer not to listen at full volume because it's too loud so again i don't get the comments about the player being too quiet this thing is almost too easy to use just don't forget to use the adapter on the turntable if you're new to the record world and your vinyls sound warped use the rubber pad so your records don't wobble there is almost always a solution to the problems people seem to be having i have this player in green and it's almost too precious i definitely recommend it for someone with a small place and for someone who doesn't love the look of really techy players it's not too small but fits easily on a desk top and i'm speaking for someone who was really worried about purchasing this and almost didn't because of all the negative reviews floating around works great love it i made a great looking beatles record player out of this gem actually came out really nice love awesome table inexpensive well made the needle is a bit light it would be good if there was a bit more weight to it for tracking the vinyl but it is quite a nice piece of equipment at the price point if you are not an audiophile this is an awesome pretty freaking cool way to scratch your vinyl itch if it skips rest a small coin on top of the needle head trendy easy to transport and it plays pretty clear aux out ability is great for making the records play louder and clearer as the built in speakers aren't the loudest thing around the only thing i didn't like what was it oh yeah there's nowhere to store the cord internally that is a pain but whatever life goes on everything about the player itself has met my expectations works great bought so my husband could hear his dad's voice the record was from it pleased us i thought it would play a little louder but not a deal breaker nice record player for the price it is downright adorable yeah said my teen now she can play my old vinyls i was wary after some of the reviews but this is fantastic i've seen people complain about the speakers but i'm not really sure what their expectations were no it won't sound a whole party but for some easy evening listening the sound quality is honestly great i am so so pleased with this product fantastic value this is a great player for someone who just wants to listen to records and not have an expensive set up i love it it's super small and cute it sounds beautiful i wasn't going to buy it because of all the negative reviews but i'm glad i did so much fun bought this for my daughter as a christmas gift it was by far her favorite this was a gift for my daughter for christmas and she absolutely loves it the speakers are great to have my daughter uses the built in speakers and her bluetooth speakers purchased as a christmas gift for my yr old daughter she loves it i had to show her how to operate it the sound is very good and the case is lovely thinking of buying one for myself i appreciated the expedient shipping as well it was a present for my niece she love it nice product the belt seems a little loose as some records sound a little slow visually attractive and has good sound i bought this as a gift for my fianc e and she absolutely loves it the sound quality is great and it looks very cool definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good record player super easy to set up as a novice i'm posting as her daughter i was impressed by the color selection and clarity of the instructions provided also i'm excited about how light and portable it is i've only used it once but so far so good super stylish and just as described the seller shipped quickly and it was one of my daughters favorite christmas gifts absolutely love this came on time and is well worth the money simple instructions and easy to use my first ever turntable and i'm completely in love with it i never would have predicted that my year old daughter would want a record player for her birthday but this was what she wanted she loves it she first spotted this at a local used book store but amazon's price was significantly lower good value quality it is a great cheap record player that gets the job done it is a little small for inch but it still plays them fine the speakers aren't very loud but you can plug in head phones or a speaker to make it louder i do not have a problem with skipping but if you do have a problem put a quarter over the needle to hold it down it is a very simple fix if you are new to vinyls then get this record player it's a great start to playing records because it is very inexpensive the shipping was all excellent may i add it is also super cute it was a gift for my friend and she love it very good quality and arrived two days early this is probably the best thing i've ever purchased off amazon opening this box was like watching s child open presents on christmas morning i think it has great sound and i love how easy it is to transport and the color is amazing i use it at work and home and everyone thinks it's great my granddaughter asked for this for christmas it plays and sounds good now we wish we hadn't got rid of all our vinyl old things become new again got this as a christmas gift for my sister the color is a little darker than shown in the picture fyi but still looks great and the price here on amazon beats the heck out of most places i originally went to urban outfitters but they wanted like more for the same one i was shocked after she opened it and got it out put sam smith's in the lonely hour lp on it the sound was really good for those two little speakers i love the vinyl is coming back she loved it and it was pretty easy to use cons the only one i found was that i noticed on other competitors that they offered more options this one is very simple lift needle put it over lower needle and that's pretty much it well and volume button pros sound is really surprisingly amazing easy to use i got this as a christmas gift for my parents this year and it was really simple to set up and easy to use i didn't have the intentions of getting an elaborate system because i know it would be used casually perfect gift for the casual record listener my item was delivered day ahead of schedule good so far player plays great i'm a new vinyl enthusiast and i primarily like them for the album cover art and just collecting my favorite music albums but i decided that my vinyls shouldn't just sit on a shelf so i bought this as a starter and i love it it's everything i hoped for i enjoy the tinny warm sound it makes it's how vinyls are i would recommend to anyone whos just looking to play some vinyls speakers are very quiet but plug in headphones and it sounds awesome i was so pleased to receive this turntable which urban outfitters also sells but this was a much better deal and the exact same product it works very great the sound even goes a tad louder than i thought it would and i can always add speakers the color is beautiful and there are absolutely no flaws that i can see and i've used it quite a bit already so pretty and works really well definitely worth the money my daughter is very happy with her new record player the speakers aren't great to say the least but you can plug it in to other speakers for better sound good turntable for the price the issue is that it is very quiet the good news is you can hook up to an external speaker my sister who received the gift loves it got this for my sons for their first way of listening to music on their own without having to share our music it is really great for them they use it regularly and enjoy it i like that they can carry it around from place to place if they want to as well though they haven't yet fun looks beautiful cant wait to give it to my dad for christmas this was delivered on time well packaged and as expected at first glance the turntable looks mighty small and cheap almost too small for the larger sized records i don't know why this color is called turquoise because it looks more tiffany blue than anything else my wife was having a bad day and she looked almost disappointed when i showed it to her but to my wife and i's surprise it played flawlessly neither of us has ever owned one and we were able to set up and play a record within seconds it's very user friendly and easy to learn and to add to the list of surprises it plays very well i bought this as a christmas present for my wife but upon seeing it we opened it to make sure it was what we were looking for it was my wife's face went from tired worn and sad to happy and full of life when she first heard it play she loves the color and the ability to just unplug it and take it with her the speakers are loud and clear enough for the price size take into account this record player is portable so the sound quality isn't meant to be the greatest but i was delighted it's louder and clearer than our laptop speakers and filled our downstairs living room with music perfect for what we needed thank you so much the sound is so clear crystal clear and the color is beautiful this is totally worth the buy and frankly worth more i loved the price though this is a great product overall and i am extremely impressed and proud of my buy i bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it it is very cute and makes a great sound the rca ports on the back hooked right into my home theater system and allowed us the chance to have that classic vinyl sound through our big speakers crosley lives up to its reputation for great products amazing product i cannot get over the quality for such a reasonable price got it as a christmas present ended up opening it and playing around with it myself i now plan to order one for myself soon beautiful color and great sound my daughter loves it really pleased with this product it arrived several days early which was great the color is gorgeous it plays at a high volume level it's portable so i can bring it in the kitchen while i cook perfect for me thanks crosley freaking amazing loved it awesome sound super light can put it anywhere anytime good for travel not disappointed exactly what she wanted works great she loved it i'm happy sure it's cheaply made of cheap products but what do you expect it's not an dollar record player it works the sound quality from the built in speakers is tinny but you can use the red white audio out or mp th output to run it to a better sound system if you prefer i love mine it's cute and compact it's smaller than you expect but really take a second and think about the size of an lp and then you'll realize that it's definitely small if the record is hanging off but it does a good job and it's super cute i received this player as a gift and it works wonderfully it suits my needs for a small player that i can take with me when i move the sounds quality is great i haven't played in new records yet only old ones the blue is a beautiful pop of colour for my room absolutely love it great for portable music and for small spaces it plays well and packs ridiculously easy the color is beautiful and the price is more than fair great little turn table love it great record player with super easy set up i bought this as a gift for myself and i love it being my first record player i grew up in the cd era it was pretty simple to figure out i've put together a little record collection and now i finally have something to play them on works great the battery life leaves a little to be desired but it may be my own operator error the size is about the same as a brief case and is surprisingly light the exterior is a nice feeling leathery material and holds up well can't wait to listen to more great music with the rich buttery sound of vinyl well i asked for a pink record player but instead i got a baby blue this is a fantastic little player it is not only attractive but compact and easy to store away if need be i've so enjoyed listening to my old vinyl on this and i've recommended it to friends comes with an adapter so you can play you can play both the larger standard albums and the little s exactly as described very compact the sound it amazing works beautifully extremely satisfied with my purchase love it super cute shipped fast surprisingly loud for a portable worth the money great quality amazing sound my daughter asked for this for her th birthday perfect color she loves it perfect for in her room my granddaughter is into vintage and she loved this as a yr bday gift i love the look of it but will need to find a better speaker to plug into it does the job and the color options are great you can tell the pieces are a little cheap plastic but the sound is good and friends love it got for a friend she loves it was a present for the grand kids they have a lot of fun with their record player thank you this vinyl's so great it makes your simple classic vinyl into a kbps sound amazing clear sound free from unwanted noises this is record player spins smooth and was a great but for the price it also looks very sleek works just like advertised pleased with purchase a good solid first machine for someone but don't expect it to keep up with some djs system pros low cost simple set up portable good sound warm and staticky like a record player should be without cranking the volume full blast variety of colors keep the box and you have the perfect record case for those truly on a budget cons fragile the arm lock broke the first day the turn table does wobble but it does not affect play skips often simple fix attach a quarter to the end of the arm with a piece of tape or a drop of hot glue to add just a touch more weight small and convenient in size love the aux port and head phone port needs louder speakers if youre going to be using it outside but as a bedroom piece its perfect perfect this thing plays great i received this as an xmas gift last yr and it stay has a great sound the corners on this though seems to be peeling off this record player is amazing the speakers are great so you don't have to plug in external speakers but can if you want to the only thing is when using headphones the jack doesn't work with some headphones so you may have to use another jack besides if that makes sense but other than that i have no complaints i had to tape down a quarter and a nickle on the arm as a first time vinyl collector in a long time i enjoy playing records on this player good seller just as advertised thanks perfect for my retro year old daughter she loves it my daughter in law loved it you get your moneys worth and more the sound is amazing i was very impressed perfect stars a perfect gift for any music lovers great product this was a gift for my daughter's th birthday she really likes it she's has been playing her albums and 's on it it has great sound we are very pleased with it fantastic when i first received my crosley it was either playing too slow or too fast so i sent it back and had a new one arrive in days that one also played too slow or too fast i called the costumer service for crosley and they directed me to a video on there website that showed how to replace the belt it was simple and is working perfectly now i like that color and it is very light weight you get what you pay for with this and you are mostly paying for the appearance but it works well once you fix the apparently common issue of the speed control not working properly love it great for travel could have better output of sound i use this daily and i absolutely love it it's speakers are louder than i anticipated and it has a super cute look to it it has every played flawlessly every vinyl record i've tried to play on it so far no issues the seller shipped it quick and i received it on time i would definitely buy from this seller again just as i remember as a kid love it i have a small room and wanted a tiny quiet player to listen to in my space but this player gets so loud that i can hear it in the kitchen with the dish washer going very good for chore day i've seen a lot of comments about the needle being too light and skipping but i haven't had the problem in the whole year i've owned it packaged arrived on time i was reluctant to buy it at first because some of the negative reviews but it sounds great the quality of this record player is top notch i would recommend this particular turntable to anyone wanting one i'm very happy with it i thought i could hook up extra speakers to this but the unit isn't strong enough to power them so i need an amplifier as well other than that this is a great little turntable and adorable to boot great product very satisfied lets me play my favorite vinyl disks with ease i really love how it creates sound sufficient for my relaxation needs thanks grand daughter loves it worked really well and everything i expected loved it i'll try my best not to sound hipster but this vinyl player is very unique and its vintage look enticed me to buy it looks good in my themed room when nirvana and rem members were still babies i'm only yet i listen to vinyls great player though we love our crosley it's a great looking little turntable and the price is right it was for our teenage son who wants to start a vinyl collection he loves the retro look we have had no problems with it and the sound quality is definitely good enough for the price you can always purchase speakers if you want a more powerful sound in our home it's a fun novelty we will to probably never wear out the needle we received a bunch record from my wife's grandma i got this for my wife so she could play many of those old records it was fun seeing my wife's face light up as this is a very cute looking piece lets face it you're not going to rock out with this thing with its stock speakers in a quiet room this plays sintra with a very wonderful vintage feel this has rca outputs so you can connect it to a larger system this has speed the adapter for s has a convenient spot for itself for storage i hate when people use a small system and say it has a tiny or tin e sound those people need to look elsewhere it's small don't expect much i understand that vinyl has it's place in hifi but this is a wonderful lofi setup cute looks cute sound and convenient this is great little piece and in the right setting has emits a wonderful sound got this for my wife as a gift to go in her office she loves it perfect colors vintage retro look speaker isn't much but what do you expect it does have outputs if you want to send the audio to other speakers wait for the price to be around and buy you won't regret and everyone will love it as an accent piece to and office or guest bedroom only complaint is speakers don't put out a ton of sound outside of that this is great wanted to dabble in playing vinyl's and this crosley is a really great start at doing so the sound quality could be better but with the option to plug in different speakers it is an easy fix it's quite simple to get the hang of and places very nicely in an apartment or dorm room style the blue is so adorably cute and the size is small enough to tuck away somewhere overall if you're looking for something small convenient and more for beginner purposes i would totally recommend this crosley teenager loves it great condition everything was there and my item was shipped and at my house in around days absolutely love i've been wanting a record player for some time but everything i've found has been expensive this is everything i've ever wanted the color the size the price the sound quality is great and i love having the headphone jack just in case perfect for traveling if need be i'm so happy with this the look of it is so chic cute i'm not a record head by any means and i know i can get a better one for more money and if i had a large collection that'd probably be the case but as of now i like it and it's practical for my sometime use the first one i received the left speaker had issues and amazon sent me a brand new one for free without having to send my original one back first and wait the processing time and etc i just had days to return the broken one amazon seriously has their game together when it comes to customer service i really like this turntable it's very portable and so cute one thing about the speakers though they are kind of weak and work well in a small room however if you plug it into better speakers the sound quality is really impressive we love this turntable great sound easy to use and looks great i love this turntable so much my dad had a huge record collection but then completely forgot about them and gave them to me to hold onto his old turntable from the early 's was broken so i bought this one i'm so impressed i love the way it sounds and it's super easy to use the volume isn't an issue because i just listen to it in my room and i don't see why so many people say it's a bad turntable it's great for starters and i love the packaging and appearance of it i recently had broken my record player that a friend had given me and had no idea where to get a new one the first place to start looking was obviously amazon i got on and found this pretty quickly by searching for the color it was shipped quickly in time for us to play our new record the day we got it for not having any external speakers connected the sound quality is great i have it connected in my living room and can hear it from my bedroom while i'm getting ready you can hook up external speakers if you'd like to so that's also a cool option all in all i give this a star rating i can't think of anything i'd like to change and i know it also comes in different colors it's a great product for music lovers best price performance for long researches fast shippment good quality this is a great introductory record player if you are interested in starting a collection but not sure of the financial commitment required for a pricier system the color is cute and is decorative in addition to functional the sound quality is decent it is a nice conversational piece when you have guests other reviewers have mentioned that it skips however we have had for about months now with no issues we use it at least once a week i believe that other buyers may have accidently broken the needle it is extremely tiny and i almost did the same speakers work fine and it is a good volume that we can hear through the whole house great for parties bought it as a gift for my teenage daughter and she loved it sound quality is good and love that it's portable love it but pricey for how much i use it excellent look and sound quality aux cable worked perfectly been using vinyl lately to help me relax every sunday this vinyl player will surely soothe your ears and remove all the stress you acquired in working the whole week very pocket friendly price yes it's cute but it has a nice sound and simple controls which is perfect for just playing your s it does not get terribly loud i have it at full volume and can enjoy throughout my condo without bothering my neighbors it offers the option to plug in speakers bluetooth or an ipod or headphones i am thoroughly loving it and getting to enjoy my old records is wonderful i love this thing my friend has one and that's the reason i got it best buy ever totally recommend super cute and works really well came perfectly packaged easy to figure out how to use great sound it gives you that 's feel even if the record is from this generation would highly recommend perfect thank you so much expected better sound o integrated speakers i love it i use it a lot its very retro i absolutely love this i got it in turquoise and it's a very pretty color it works really well and if you don't know how to use a record player the instructions are easy to follow highly recommend this product customer was very happy exceeded expectations thanks it looks just like pictured it works perfectly sound quality is great based on the quality of the record easy to use and adorable i am very happy with it works great but my only issue is that they didn't make a good option to store the power cord had they made it slightly less bulky it would store easily inside something they should have thought of on a portable player i still put mine inside but then you candlt clamp down one of the side clamps so it looks a bit goofy and may cause long term damage a great turntable i bought this as my first ever owned record player i was nervous on buying it since there were so many negative reviews but i bought it and i couldn't be happier it's so simple to use it brings me so much joy to listen definitely would buy it again it is amazing its perfect for small get togethers and chilling around the house the only thing to keep in mind is that with a portable turntable the sound isn't as loud as a turntable with speaker components but the quality is great and the sound is still fairly loud its a definite buy so very cute and i just love mine so much also i love the fun colours love love love this record player quality item love it when i looked at the others reviews before buying this turntable i was a bit unsure about the sound from this item but after my purchase i was not at all upset for my first time buying a record player turntable i think that it is great i love it so far no problems with it my yo daughter was thrilled with it that was the important thing love it so much i like it its cute and good quality the only down side is that the speakers arent the best its good but sounds even better when you connect speakers to it but i am happy with my buy first one didn't work and they sent another great for as much as i use it the speakers could be a little louder easy fix just buy some additional speakers with components great purchase i've made in a long time bought this for my daughter for her room and it was so easy to set up and plays everything from the really old vinyl to brand new great sound and the volume is perfect for her bedroom if you are looking for something that you can really blast you might need a different unit or external speakers she loves the look and the sound i don't know how people are having negative experiences with this product honestly won of my best purchases in a long time was worried whe i ordered it because people were saying it has a skipping problem but it isnt skipping for me i'm completely thrilled not bad for a teenager's first foray into vinyl the speakers are incredibly weak and sound terrible though i bought this item for my daughter she cares more about how cute and cool it is than how it really sounds though this is a great record player it was a gift for my daughter who us now discovering the world of vinyl records with great satisfaction i suggest this for anyone who wants to reenter the record world of enjoyment i love this little cruiser i have been playing it almost non stop since it arrived i have several jazz albums and they all play beautifully on this player i have it set up in my living room and i can hear it throughout my townhouse if it is on full volume this player is very easy to use and the auto stop function is very nice as well please keep in mind that this is an player it's not going to be as stunning as a player but it is a great value if you just need something for the home or office to just relax and listen i'm thinking of buying another one for my office i love it so much i was really looking into purchasing my best friend a record player for her birthday this was one of the first i can across knowing her i both were newbies to the world of record players i really did my research on which brands were better durable nice sounding etc i was on the fence about buying this after reading the reviews there were good and bad but knowing that this would be her first one on her record vinyl journey i went ahead purchased this bad boy plus she is about to redecorate her room the light blue color choice fit perfectly it also sounds great very very well with meeting my expectations after the first one i recieved didn't spin i was able to return it and replace it easily it plays wonderfully of course it's not going to be as good as one of the more expensive ones but i just wanted something to play my records on in my room this is definitely worth the price our granddaughter has been pushing to hear all my old vinyl records she loves the phonograph and left with quite a stack of vinyl for her listening pleasure i love that it has the three speeds so she can hear old s old s and s i also love that it has a pocket that holds a adapter right on top it will never get lost that way she now can enjoy our old albums my parents old albums and my grandparents' s i may get myself one of these phonographs too bravo for crosley it's a great product i can't compare it to any other turn table because this is my first one but it records sounds amazing doesn't skip the speakers sound good i'm not saying there bad but i may get some tower speakers for it but all around this is a great product for anyone who want to try turntable this was a gift to my granddaughter i've had nothing but positive feedback but cannot give it a star as i have not personally used the item myself amazibg i purchased this as a gift for my retro daughter who immediately put one of my old who albums on to test it the sound was surprisingly big for such a small player unlike the ones i grew up with nicely done i absolutely loved it absolutely love it it plays really well and the ability to play music from my phone is great however the term portable is a bit misleading i thought that i could take it anywhere including outside but it needs to be plugged into the wall probably just pure stupidity on my part but that's the only thing that wasn't what i expected great product a gift but granddaughter likes it very much fantastic sound i only wish it could be louder it's great for a newcomer to vinyl love my record player it seems to have a hard time plugging into aux cords to be played over speakers tho my daughter loved it it met my expectations and then some best price fast shipping great big hit with my daughter for her th birthday she loved it first of all look at the price the people on here giving one star reviews are not being realistic this is a great record player for it's price and size it's way cute compact and sounds great if you want better quality then you're going to have to pay more i've had mine for a year and it is still working wonderfully and providing hours of quality listening i highly recommend for casual record listeners it was packaged great to avoid any casualties easy to open and was already set up so all i had to do was plug it in the manual was easy to understand and it arrived right on time i'm in love with my player and it's only been hours absolutely love it it works perfectly it's cheap and it's great great use of my money and the perfect gift awesome i got this one over the other better record players because of its design luckily the quality isn't too bad either the volume gets pretty loud and controlling it is simple i do get scared the the lid will somehow shut close while it's playing but it hasn't so far it works perfectly and i enjoy it we use this record player on the patio of our restaurant so customers can come and play what they want to hear it is a big hit the record player sits outside and has been wonderful for a solid week it's easy to carry in and out and the sound through our speakers is amazing i highly recommend this product great christmas gifts the girls enjoy these what a cool gift nice and compact for music the sound is crisp for such a small and portable device i love it just got into vinyls and this is perfect bought another for my mom a such a lovely blue record player i don't know how it compares to other portable record players but i love it excelent i got the shipment so fast and i love listening to my crosley now perfect we bought this as a gift for our niece and she loves it she is hard to please as well very quirky and sweet just buy it you'll love it i got this vinyl player for my birthday years ago and i've had no issues with it i love it if you're just looking for something inexpensive and portable this is definately a great choice i really recommend using external speakers the internal ones aren't so great all in all great little vinyl player for the price it is great looks beautifull sounds great and i love it i was so excited to receive this record player then i realized none of my records would play i even bought a few new ones still did not work as the other reviewers said the arm is not heavy enough however if you simply secure a quarter to the flat space just behind the needle on the top of the arm they all play perfectly i didn't want to return it but i can see why people did the quarter doesn't bother me you could probably use something cooler i hope this helps some of you enjoy your crosley ps i secured mine with a tiny price of rolled tape worked good item had a seam for the cover that was located on the front corner would have been nice if it was located in the back corner to hide it better it's exactly as the picture it looks really cute the turquoise color is gorgeous only complaint i have is that the plug has a slight very faint ringing buzzing noise to it when it's plugged in you can hear the sound if you have the turntable plugged in and you're not playing any records i've resorted to unplugging it when i'm not using it because the ringing drives me crazy aside from that though it's perfect i absolutely love this record player i'd say if you're just getting into vinyl records this product is for you perfect plays well sounds great love it smart purchase it was cheap but it works if you're just getting into vinyl first of all be careful where you buy this from i went to a certain place that starts with a u and ends with an rban outfitters and paid more than amazon is charging i can't say at all that this is a bad turntable sure compared to a player it is probably awful the built in speakers are just awful they sound rejected world war ii radios but if you plug it into an external speaker it sounds wonderful i have it hooked up to a beats pill and i'm loving how vinyl sounds through it the real issue i have with this turntable is that for something that is marketed as portable it can't be used with batteries why market it as portable if you have to have it plugged in that makes no sense it has a handle has a lid has terrible internal speakers and no battery compartment excellent this was a birthday present for our sweet year old our son has said she wants her records we also purchased for her played everyday now that says it all so easy to use and brings so much happiness to our granddaughters not so sure about our son though he's frozen out i got this for my little sister for her th birthday and she loves it the volume is perfect for her but i would external speakers if you want to control vocals and bass like that but this is a great gift idea the overall product is very nice it also looks cool just sitting there however i baught this for my boyfriend so he could have one more set of speakers to listen to his music out of by the pictures it shows you can hook up a phone and listen to it but this product does not come with the cord to do that function at least mine didn't luckily my boyfriend had one of these cords and it is used for what i intentionally baught it for awesome and affordable product great sound and adequate functions adapts to my iphone and sounds great i love it works well bought it to replace my ge wildcat this works like a charm love this little record player if you're expecting this to play loudly without any external speakers you may be a little disappointed but i'm honestly impressed with the sound even with the teeny built in speakers this is exactly what i was looking for and it fits my needs super well i'll eventually buy some cute bigger speakers when i save up the money but this lets me listen to my records without needing a huge starting investment i love my portable record player i can hook it up to the surround sound very easily great quality love it bought it for my grand daughter she loves it my first record player and it works really nice it doesn't skip and plays all my records in really nice quality works and is great love it perfect size for my smaller bedroom this producted was delivered quickly and without any problems looks great and sounds really good awesome we've had this for about months or so now and i don't really have a lot of the issues people have listed here yes the volume isn't grand but you can easily hookup speakers and it's ok works well glad we got it it's super cute i love this record player but the first one they sent in was busted and didn't even turn but i ordered a new one and it came in days early same and it came in a day early for the first one it has a great look and great sound great to have a record player again great case and love he color thank you got here on time girlfriend loved it glad i chose this one i am very happy with the record player the color is beautiful and the sound is great love the nostalgic tunes great quality very happy and love this product volume could be a little louder but its really good i really like it good quality sound the color looks a little cheaper then i expected but its still acceptable bought it loved it now it in my closet untill i decide to use it again i grew up with a turntable in a case purchased in disrepair from austin isd warehouse and repaired by mr wizard on burnet road i used it back into a second death and decided to purchase this crosley model my soon to be year old loves it just as much as i loved my old one anne murray's hippo in my bathtub never sounded better looks classic plays records flawlessly really cool retro look wish speakers went a bit louder but overall great buy wonderful the sound quality is not what you get from a big high tech surround sound system but it works very well for small spaces love everything about it although i am late sending in this review sorry this portable turntable is perfect it arrived on time and we had no problems thank you this was a gift the person it was gifted to enjoys it love it one speaker may be a little messed up great gift as a turntable works great fast delivery wonderful portable turntable works well great price and we are having fun listening to our old albums am in love with it can ask for anything more this the best thing anyone can have and enjoy the ths my sister and dad loved the gift thanks so much got this for my gf's daughter for xmas along with some of my favorite records sounds good for the price like a record should sound when i grew up as a kid she's actually listening to whole albums now my year old said this was the best christmas gift she got plays it all the time bought as a gift for my cousin and she loves it has had no problems with it whatsoever super cute love it bought this for my y o niece for christmas it's the end of february and she still

i love this it plays so well and is so cute i play it everyday and it can play or s i love them it's really a great record player it so cool works great crosley has been making appliances for decades they make good products loving this portable record player great sound and so easy to use great little turn table good functionality not so great speakers it works great for a dorm ended up buying two of these as both my brother and daughter loved it simple little record player works great daughter loves it love ti su much i liked that the color of the case is even better in real life than in the picture the fidelity is great and i loved the size it fitted perfect on my desk d bought for grandson for christmas he said it worked fine but the headphone plug didn't work great product sound quality is fantastic wonderful in every way she was thrilled with the gift great product for a great price would buy from seller again great record player thank you for sending something that works i loved this turntable it was exactly what i wanted i love the fact that i don't have to have extra speakers they are built into the turntable love it love it plays and sounds great for as small as it is which i also love because it does not take up alot of room would highly recommend it plays lps with a weird pitch i guess for what it is its ok probably something better out there for a little bit more our grandaughter loved it very happy with this exactly what i wanted the color is gorgeous it's lightweight and compact and fits perfectly in a small space bought this for my daughter i had one in pink back in the day awesome perfrct does it's job but the volume is really low quality it does have a port for a headset so speakers can be added it looks very cute and it's easy to store i like it but more importantly my wife likes it i gave it to her on her birthday and today we went to the record store and she bought several albums that she hasn't heard in years i can see that her love of music especially on vinyl will be renewed and increase p s note to seller seller the attachment was not included with our crosley bummer i love it i finally get to listen to all my vinyl after so many years and i love how easy it is to transport i truly enjoy having it to enjoy all of my old music chose same day shipping at checkout and came same day although it arrived and the inside in one area that ripped a little although quite unnoticeable it still would have been nice to have a perfectly new record player but other than that it's great nice sound quality too i got this record player as a birthday present and after seeing the style and color i fell in love and then i read the reviews i was extremely discouraged at first to even play a used record on it after seeing all the complaints when i put on the first record it sounded just fine my friend who once bought a turntable said that it sounded great even by his standards i was ready to go online and post an awesome five star review but then i decided to wait when looking at all the five star reviews it seemed like the writers just got the thing while all the one star reviewers had owned the turntable for a while so i decided to wait and see i have owned the turntable for two months now and it is still playing records splendidly with only a very slight decrease in sound quality even after playing the same used record for a month or so everyday on new records it sounds even better i never once had problems with skipping and the sound quality is great if you are new to turntables i would recommend especially if you are unsure if you like vinyl yet but if you have experience and and is looking for a record player to last a lifetime i would spend time else where my son loved this gift he was very happy with it it's perfect i purchased this record player after having read all the reviews saying not to buy it because it was a piece of junk with a little common sense i figured it wouldn't be a high quality product anyway you get what you pay for however for never having owned a record player before i am only after all i found it pretty easy to use and not a total waste of money people looking to buy a record player with amazing sound quality should look into something more expensive i bought this because i wanted that older lesser quality sound and that's what i got so far i haven't had any problems with the way it handles records a few records i bought have skips in them already but that is the fault of the record itself not the player the only problem i've really run into with this player is the lid it has to be open pretty far back in order for it not to touch the record while its playing but other than that use the control for the needle arm make sure there's not dust or anything sticking to the needle use the rubber mat it comes with and it's a pretty good quality record player for its price a we purchased this for our daughter for christmas she loves it i like the small compactness of it i can take it anywhere although the sound is not like a true stereo i have no problems with it it's nice to have something to be able to play records again highly recommend it to those that have records they don't want to get rid of but don't have that big dinosaur of a stereo anymore to play them on great choices of colors and price was right too my daughter absolutely loved it awesome perfect for my year old works well my year old niece listens to records on her turntable more than she listens to music on her iphone i guess everything old really is new again got this for my yr old daughter she is happy with it the included speakers are not very loud but they are ok for what she wanted she has said that when using headphones it does not sound that good so awesome we purchased this record player for our yo daughter she loves it but i feel sound could be a little better it is cute and a great choice for the new fad of vinyl records love it just what i want and need i bought this as a christmas present for my daughter imagine my surprise when my baby boomer husband brought out his old 's from back in the day this started a music fest that brought back memories and joy the crosley is adorable and compact and has a wonderful sound our daughter loved it easily the best gift idea that we had my daughter loves it great turntable but the speakers are not that high quality i still enjoy it but have to run a line out to another set of speakers to enjoy fully awesome product my package arrived sooner than i expected in perfect condition it had all the things i needed it was extremely easy to set up and use i would recommend to anyone who hasn't dealt with record players previously to read the instructions carefully because they are very delicate this record player sounds beautiful works better than i could ever imagine also it is definitely worth the money hope this helps the record player works well for some records we had to tape a penny to the record player to make it heavy enough the record player is used times a week and has not experienced problems so far even able to connect to surround sound system for quality sound product works and sounds great for size and price perfect for playing those old vinyl i have recommended to friends who have now purchased their own love the fun colors great gift for my teenage daughter great sound quality and super cute this is a very nice record player for the vinyl enthusiast it's small enough to store away or leave on a shelf my daughter loves hers and uses it almost every day sounds amazing with our bose this is a great portable player it's simple in function and the sound could be a tad louder but it is a retro style piece that it's not getting to be a super high quality machine all in all i love it cool looking works well and just can plug in external speakers love this item it was very good surprise gift my daughter was thrilled exactly what she wanted and excellent condition record player arrived in time for christmas was easy to use and had good sound my daughter love it works great i'm having alot of fun with this my wife loves it fast shipping child likes it perfect for my granddaughter to play her vinyl on it color match is also inportant great just what i wad hoping it would be its not perfect and won't be good enough for real experts but it plays great and looks just like the picture what a big hit for a little player this was order for my mom at christmas and she loves it the sound is really good for being a portable player could not ask for anything better super easy to use just plug it in put the record on lift the needle onto the record and it plays when the record is done you have to manually lift the needle off the record player awesome love it i ordered this for my daughter as a christmas gift she loves it my step daughter loved the gift i was very happy that it was well package when it arrived vintage this was a gift and the recipient loved it just listened to pink floyd's the wall on it and the speakers held up nicely the only oddity i can see is that when you play a the lid has to be tilted back to allow for the size of the album we bought this for our daughter for christmas she loves it it works great and matches her wall in her room perfectly she is and getting into vinyl perfect gift not too big speakers aren't the best quality but there is a headset jack to plug in headphones or external speakers overall perfect i think it works well i was scared at first because the sound was very off with regards to speed i just put the rubber plate under the record the player comes with it and it fixed everything fantastic my wife loves this unit and plays it every day we have a lot of old vinyl so we got to hear music we haven't in quite a while this was a christmas gift from my mom love it great sound and i haven't had any problems i'm in love with this little thing i've been wanting to start collecting vinyl for a long time but didn't want to do so without a owning a turntable and b starting off on the cheaper side to make sure i loved it before i went for more expensive models a few of my friends recommended the crosley cruiser to me and after thoroughly reading the reviews yes even the bad ones i went for it now that it's here and i'm listening on it i'm in love i started off by just purchasing two records pure heroine by lorde and the acoustic things by state champs and both sound amazing on this little thing if you want loud volume i will say that this turntable can be for you too i personally prefer my music at a more comfortable volume so the built in speakers work great for me but you can hook it up to speakers as well so you're still getting the loud volume if you want it came shipped so well and i had it out of the box and ready to use within five minutes i'm already shopping for more records thanks to this thing and i'm very happy i chose it as my starter model one day i'll get a more expensive and professional turntable but this little thing is doing wonders for me so far great gift along with affordability pretty good overall you're going to want to buy external speakers for it for better sound projection plays properly the turntable itself spinning part measures about inches and the record is stable and sticks out the edge comes with a adapter in it which is great if you are going to mix songs do not buy this record player if you plan on dj ing or just mixing songs you cannot turn a record backwards you cannot make it spin the opposite direction works great great sound cool looking piece of nostalgia sound is not very loud and speakers are so so but it's acceptable to play some vinyl audiophiles should and probably would look elsewhere my granddaughter loved it arrived in good packaging i just use this speaker at my bedroom and the battery life is longer than what i expected the bass is good this speaker is best for people like me who loves music and adventurous this id's a great quality speaker for the and arrived super fast the blue tooth connectivity isn't the best it will lose signal sometimes and the music cuts out if i have it clipped to my belt loop and my phone in my pocket on the opposite side of my body seems my body is enough to block the bluetooth signal i can replicate making it cut out every time if i position it properly other than that for the size and price it sounds really good and the volume is loud would definitely buy again it's awesome i use it every day out in my shop love it take it everywhere with me altough volume isn't that high works nicely pretty loud for the price good battery life durable as any jbl stars for sure nice and loud absolutely love it perfect for riding my bike and keeping myself focused on the road this little speaker packs a lot of power lasts a long time and is easy to use great speaker i use it daily great sound great sound best little speaker for the price super loud not only do have one i have two because i love this little thing so much i keep one in my car and one in my purse i have dropped them many times and they still work very well the only complaint i have is that they can be difficult to pair for a speaker the size of the palm of your hand it is impressive bass is lacking but the sound is crisp and loud enough to fill a large room love how compact it is and it seems very durable i have not tested the waterproof ness of it but it looks pretty well sealed works great the sound is solid for the size it's a good speaker excellent sound quality at the right price i bought this speaker for biking and camping and paddle boarding as well as to loan to my year old music lover when he s wants to take music outside in our house we are bose fans we own and love the bose mini soundlink and the bose soundtouch but i didn t like the price reviews or look of the bose waterproof soundlink micro i didn t want to spend for bose with a cold as one reviewer said nor did i want to hand over something that cost to my son anyway long story short i decided to give this jbl a try so far it s uh maaaaaaazing honestly i m shocked by how great this tiny speaker sounds also it paired truly effortlessly with both my iphone and my son s kindle i can t yet speak to its long term durability when it comes to biking camping and paddle boarding but so far for the price point i m super impressed by the sound and quality i say buy needed something for the shower and my gf loves it good sound not as bass y as others but good enough for its size this speaker is amazing it is loud and clear sounds like a bose go to settings on phone bluetooth and it automatically syncs up great sound for the size super easy to setup and use never been happier with a blue tooth speaker this device sounds better than the chinese bluetooth speaker i bought however it is a pain to use the usb charging connection is so tight and difficult to use that i just keep the charging cable permanently stuck in place since that makes it tough to take into the shower area this thing is a bit less 'waterproof' than it advertises i got sick n tired of trying to plug the silly thing in when it made it's little 'time to recharge' chiming sound sigh with the charging cable inserted it is bothersome to turn on off the device since the cable drapes over the on off indentation so sadly every time i turn the device on i have to pick it up move the cable aside then press the on off indentation great sound for such a small speaker amazing product the sound is loud and clean wow sounds great for such a small package holds a charge well easy to carry around no matter where you want to listen to music or use with your phone very pleased with this product and would buy more this is above and beyond what i was expecting i love it love the sleek and functional design it looks and feels really expensive plus the sound quality is just perfect and the clip is going to come in so handy and convient i haven't gotten it wet or sandy yet so can't speak to that great buy good sound for a small speaker this are great for outdoor i work on the construction field and this thing can take a beating the dust and water wont mess it up or at least it will holp up better than other bluetooths highly recommended works great seems to have long battery life better than several others i have tried would like longer charging cord my first one arrive today it worked awesome sounds really good in a tiny package i found a way to make the clip work as a stand for it as well so i ordered a second one i'll let you know when i get them paired it ok but it not as loud as the first series we hang these from the saddles on our horses for quality music played from our bluetooth mp players love it fantastic this is a powerful little speaker i took it with me on a cruise so that i would have something to listen to on the beach and it did an amazing job great product exceeds my expectations sounds good i use it while riding my bike worth every penny my husband loves this speaker the speaker works great for its size portable and i like it that is small and it has a clip so i can clip it on my pants specially when i am riding a bike i was surprised at the clear volume coming out of this little thing great product i love hearing toons in the shower it's just loud enough to keep me happy and it's water proof too wonderful sound quality this speaker is amazing it's compact has great battery life and is loud i use it in the shower and even tested it in a bowl of water and it still works totally fine the clip is very useful for when i want to clip it to one of my drawers while i'm doing chores i've also used it on walks where i clip it to my key chain around my neck the only con i can say is that of course for it's size you're not getting thumpy or heavy bass so if you're a bass head then this speaker might not be for you on the flip side the sound quality is clear and crisp with no distortion as high volumes i also bought a case for the speaker to keep it protected the speaker also comes with an auxiliary cable wrapped around it if you want to use it for older mp players overall i'd say jbl knows what they're doing when it comes to sound quality i can only imagine what the jbl clip would sound like fitsand tm portable travel carry zipper protective eva hard case cover bag box for jbl clip waterproof portable bluetooth speaker use this speaker for work i work in a loud plant but clip it on my shoulder and off i go for my shift usually last about a year using daily but well worth it to keep my sanity every day works really good great sound great battery life rugged enough to handle anything my year old son throws at it perfect companion to the echo dot this little bluetooth speaker sounds good i definitely recommend it loud and sounds great very surprising for it size i've tried ordering a few action speakers in the past and ended up returning them immediately as they were no better than the iphone speakers this little speaker packs a punch and it perfect i use it on my paddleboard while biking hiking or just hanging around on the deck exactly what i was looking for and at a great price used this today for the first time at the beach and it was great had to change the playlist due to young kids being around and even at a lower level it felt like the speaker was next to you cant wait to use tomorrow for the kayaking trip excellent choice good sound really like these think they are seconds because the charging droor is a bit hard to close bought insurance so it can be replaced if any problem with charge port or battery life plays about hours lost my first one ordered another both a great super clean speaker calls and surprisingly great sonics for music from such a small speaker connects easily don't think twice painted my house with this little guy hooked to my belt loop and it kept me totally entertained for the size it outputs decent sound i felt the best sound all around came from the equalizer being on vocal booster good play time perfect for hiking with the clip design as opposed to a round clip this fits molle webbing better great sound exactly what i expect my daughter loves it nice speaker great sound this works perfect for the beach easy to link two bluetooth sounds great okay i've literally never written an amazon review before but i had to come back and write one for this speaker that i bought almost a year ago its been great good sound quality for the size and price but the real winning factor is that it is totally waterproof i know because i just put it through a washing machine cycle by accident with my clothes it still works perfectly luckily i found it before i put everything in the dryer amazing would buy another if i had the money great speaker for the price i wish there was a little more bass but it probably wouldn't be possible based on the size and price at least the bass that is present isn't distorted the bass and highs sound very good but the mids might be a little low but again the speaker sounds really good the speaker is loud enough for a small room but wouldn't fill up a large room the speaker is definitely beautiful and the clip is nice and sturdy the material it is made out of feels nice to the touch and seems to be high quality one thing to note this may be different than some bluetooth headphones you may be used to regarding the built in audio cord cable the sony bluetooth headphones i have are not required to be turned on or connected via bluetooth to anything if i have an audio cable plugged in to them directly that is not the case with this speaker though even if i have the speaker connected via the audio cable to an mp player it must be turned on and it will automatically pair connect with your phone this can be annoying if you are using a separate mp player and a phone call comes in to your phone which was previously paired to the speaker not a deal breaker but something to make note of pretty good and convenient i love how i can hook it on to my back pack when i leave the house and also pair it with my other clip when i am home doesn t have the best sound quality when in a big room but gets the job done in the house love my speaker i bought two more for gifts has good quality sound and can leave it in my bathroom or take it outside this speaker sounds the best out of all of the similar sized speakers except bose it is pretty loud and has excellent battery life the bluetooth doesn t have the best range but doesn t drop while you are in range the clip on it is handier than i thought it would be nice sound love the clip i love it for it is just what my granddaughter asked for i had it sent to her address received well and on time the sound quality is amazing it s perfectly portable for any job site going to the beach and just being able to clip on to things i m very picky when it comes to speakers but i highly recommended this speaker exactly what i expected the package arrived in good condition i am very happy with the product i love it i will always be able to play a little relaxing music when i recreate at the park without my ears being blocked and my hearing diminished as my family and friends are relaxing at the park with me i'm sure you'll be delighted as well i love it i take my in my gym bags the size is perfect and the sound is aweson excellent sound quality excellent build quality excellent battery life overall like every other jbl product i love the speaker the quality of the sound is astonishing despite how small it is looks durable and i hook it up in the shower very nice great quality for such a small speaker fits the purpose in that i clip it on to my jetski worth the money i bought original jbl micro wireless years ago still works but needed an upgrade i've owned several other portable bluetooth speakers since this is my favorite hands down so portable fits in your pocket great sound durable doesn't have to stand up and fall over like other speakers highly recommended great sound quality amazing speakers definitely recommend it for anyone to buy d go jbl jbl clip is gives pleasant and loud sound without heavy bass i removed the clip substituting a short shoelace with lobster clasps at the ends to hook onto itself i placed masking tape over the controls writing the letters u d p bt to help me learn the location of controls the little indicator light blinks slowly for power with wire and faster for power with bluetooth i like the fact that the speaker does have a power switch i am displeased with the attached mm input cable as i think that sooner or later the cable will fail and i will have to throw the speaker away i have taped the wire to the back of the speaker inside its well to reduce strain i would love to see a mm input port as found on some other speakers this is a nice lightweight and full sounding speaker that i attach to my fire tablet or phone finger strap i am very happy with my jbl my only recommendation is a warning or message when battery is low perfect for golf good mid range sound great little speaker we take it golfing and took it to the beach i have two of these speakers they both perform excellent for their size and the bluetooth range is excellent i get on average hrs of use between charges at volume very happy works well awesome product durable great sound you won t be disappointed great sound quality loud for a small compact and portable speaker glad i purchased this love it i have been really happy with the durability the functionality of the bluetooth and the sound quality the compact size makes it easy to travel with and the carabiner built in makes this an easy carry along for field work when clipped onto a belt loop or backpack it's small lite weight and sounds great it's a mail man's best friend exceeded my expectations i did alot of research and read many reviews before i finally decided to ordered it this speaker is the best speaker i have come across the sound quality is great compared to the size of the speaker satisfiedcustomer these things are great very rugged and waterproof it gets used outside doing yardwork by the pool in the kitchen and even in the shower sound is ok not great but when the speaker is this big you can only expect so much plenty of volume just no bass this one was actually a gift for a buddy who is a vet hence why i picked the camo version he loves it this was a birthday gift for my granddaughter she loved it especially the color love this i clipped it to my towel rack and i use it every day great sound for an ultra portable waterproof wireless bluetooth speaker good battery life and simple to use great sound and easy to use would recommend to anyone great speaker sound is on point obtains the perfect volume level and makes for a great gift we take it hiking on our weekend family adventures great sound and very attractive great sound the clip is handy i love this product this is my second one but the first one only lasted about a year battery stopped charging other than that it's a great speaker bought this for my dad he loves it it's simple enough for a man to use a wonderful little speaker it packs a good amount of punch for its size while it does lack some bass i fully expected it to considering the size of the package but for an average music listener it's not too much of a loss the mids and highs are vibrant i love watching videos on my phone while connected to this speaker my main reason for my purchase of this little guy however came down to practicality i'm a fairly clumsy person so i wanted something that could withstand the elements and a handful of falls this speaker is perfect for that it's truly waterproof so i don't have to worry about it getting wet in the seattle rain or the shower and it's rugged as hell i have yet to drop it but i have confidence that it'll survive any drops from a reasonable height the carabiner clip and the built in aux cord make this speaker all the more convenient i may have to buy a second just to mess with the daisy chaining capabilities a very worthwhile product perfect speaker with great sound especially for the beach or travel the battery life was very good as well mine lasted about hrs this is the forth jbl bluetooth speaker i've purchased over the years as gifts and personal i highly recommend it i love this speaker so easy to use connects to bluetooth easily and sounds great great little speaker i received one of these as a gift for being a subaru ambassador i wasn't expecting too much but i figured it was a thoughtful gift nonetheless after opening the jbl clip i was really impressed with how they included a plug for anyone who doesn't use or have bluetooth it has some awesome sound for a small and affordable speaker currently i've been using it with my desktop computer since i'm in the middle of a move and it pumps sound out very well i'm really impressed with this thing and would highly recommend it to anyone this was a gift i did not purchase this speaker on my own wow there are cheaper options on amazon but i've also had a good experience with jbl so i spent a little extra to get a brand i'm familiar with i couldn't be happier the sound this little guy puts out is incredible the battery lasts forever i've dunked it in water and dropped it a few times and it keeps on going without issue i'll update this review if anything changes but for a portable bluetooth waterproof speaker you don't really need to look any further the product arrived just as expected i recommend needed a speaker that was small adaptable and good on the go great for clipping on a backpack for biking and hiking hell i'll clip onto a cabinet handle in the kitchen and listen to some tunes while i'm preparing dinner this little thing gets loud but not too loud to where someone yells what over the music amidst conversions the option to link two together is fantastic as well i haven't tested the battery length yet but this is fantastic for listening to music in the shower love it this is just as amazing as the pill i have them both and could simply use this and be happy bgood product with excellent sound using voice over on my iphone love this speaker great for both indoor and outdoor applications daughter loves it loud enough to annoy the crap out of me from two rooms away she doesn't really use the clip but it seems sturdy great quality for a small sized speaker it was a gift for my boyfriend to bring to work so he can listen to tunes he loves it so much that he also brings it with us to parties and hooks it to the stroller when we walk our son he also loves he can hook his old ipod up to it best little speaker ever i have been through many speakers trying to find one i was happy with and hands down this thing is awesome it s not loud enough to throw a party with but in the car and sitting at the beach or park smoking a j this thing is perfect a solid portable loud speaker great sound quality pluses good sound for its size reaches reasonable volumes no low bass but to be expected surprisingly lightweight and good build quality nice design touches for example the wrap around mm audio cable the metal clip and the audio cues for on off and bluetooth pairing easy to pair supposedly waterproof didn't test minus no carrying case included even a cloth pouch would have been nice that carabiner makes a nifty little stand and the power on and power off sounds are majorly funky music follows you around man goes wherever you wanted to go you want to get up and move music follows you this little clip is awesome i purchased this over a year ago it has been through alot of abuse still works and sounds the same as the day i got it definitely would buy another one this little speaker is bad ass packs a little punch for how small it is bought for my wife to add to the stroller in her favorite color now me and the little guy stroll with all our favorite jams super loud super nice perfect for the bathroom great price excellent product highly recommended seller great little speaker pairs easily and sounds great had to buy another one thanks this little speaker is amazing what great sound absolutely love this so easy to move from room to room i remember when the speakers took up so much room you can hang this anywhere and it blends right in to the background love this little speaker it worked so well i used it at a windy beach but it was able to play nice clear music over the wind and crashing waves i would buy it again and give as a gift very nice i bought this jbl speaker for my wife to take on walks she loves it i have had nothing but good experiences with jbl bluetooth speakers perfect shower speaker clear sound to great sound light weight great fell like the clip nice and strong but flexible nice look battery life could be better but you can't win them all right exactly as described sounds great thanks great speaker very loud bought this for a trip to hawaii so we could take our music everywhere the speaker is the perfect size and is louder and clearer than expected i will recommend to family and friends very good sound and the on off button works immediately unlike every other bluetooth speaker i've tried owned usually you must hold the power button down for several seconds which to me is annoying great sound small so easy to carry around or hang anywhere love this thing bought it for my son but my wife and i use it more durable enough for fishing and camping resists water sounds great music and podcasts are clear and articulate very good product my husband has a number of co workers that have these and all lived this little speaker purchased it and love it pairs easily love this thing clear loud music in such a small container high quality assembly and material feels sturdy and well made exceeded my expectations sounds great very happy with this purchase i use it at work for personal space in a large area and at my workshop close range is great and does not project offensively into other work areas best small personal speaker i have bought this is a fantastic product way better than what i expected i use it for bbqing road trips vacations its very solid and connects easy to your device i have had several people come up to me asking what it was and where they can find it it's super rad to have this literally in the shower for getting ready however it didn't come with a charging chord and the battery doesnt last very long or hours tops could be louder unbelievable sound my grandson loved it great speaker very good quality amazing sound from a such a little device i bought this so my mom could clip it to her walker the clip is noice and solid she takes it everywhere and i don't have to worry about it being dropped or getting wet we take it with us to her indoor pool she figured it out pretty easily and it paired seamlessly with her phone it would be helpful if the controls were marked with bigger darker copy because she has serious vision issues she is almost but other than that it's perfect for her have purchased two of these as gifts each daughter says it works great i loved it tested and approved purchased this as a gift and the recipient was very pleased with it i bought this as a gift for my nephew he loves it says it works great love it so far so good works perfectly amazing sound great for using when listening to music in the shower because the bathroom makes it sound x louder whole lot of sound packed in this fist sized bluetooth speaker and i absolutely love it it s a reasonable price for a name brand speaker but it wasn t as loud as i had hoped the quality of the sound is worth the price works and sounds great use it at work every night it last for hours short recharging time amazing sound and value i've contemplated bluetooth speakers such as bose but this fits my on the go needs better with its easy carabiner attachment for clipping to packs while backpacking camping and boating hence the waterproof feature is essential although i haven't really tested its h limits beyond the convenient bluetooth connectivity it also has an out aux sound chord for plugging into other none bluetooth capable devices such as older ipods i use mine for connecting to my iphone or older ipod for on the go movie time while camping there is a reason i see this device sold everywhere it's got more sound per pound would recommend and buy again quality speaker with a reasonable price strongly recommend this is the best bluetooth speaker i've ever owned since its super compact and durable i take it with me everywhere camping biking to the beach in the shower etc for its size the sound is great and never had an issue with the sound crackling or distorting even at high volume the built in carabiner is really convenient i also really like the aux cord built into the speaker so i can use it with my old non bluetooth ipod great speaker wasn't expecting it to be a bit bigger than the og jbl clip but it still doesn't taint my opinion on the product the only problem i have is that it raddles massively on high volume which i worry will blow out the device but i guess that's to be expected from a bluetooth speaker very good came faster then expected just as advertised no issues with product or seller big or small jbl is always the best these have great quality sound with good volume but that don't last long i received it as a birthday present and my mom was so impressed by it she wanted one for her birthday too which was a few days away this is such a powerful little bluetooth portable speaker love that is easy to use and the battery lasts for days between charges so convenient to take anywhere you can have your phone i bought this as a christmas present for my husband and he loves it it has great sound the sound is great and i love the color even with taxes this is still cheaper than any price at my love stores the only downside about this is how it makes a feedback noise everytime you turn the volume up even when muy buen producto recomendable love it good sound kid loves it good sound quality i bought this to use while horseback riding in the house it sounds pretty good however outside it's not very powerful i would say better than average indoors but not going to support anyone else riding with you will probably buy another for my husband's to use while we're out perfect shower speaker also a great size to throw in my bag to take along with me easy to use the only negative is i can't tell how much charge power it has so i feel like i'm never sure if i have enough juice but with that said i have never ran the battery all the way down the charge last for hours it was purchased as a gift for my grandson and he loved it i purchased the for my wife to have at home and it works great i purchased the for myself to have while traveling for work it sounds great travels great and has a good long battery life looks great feels great amazing bass power was surprised by the volume because i had low expectations but expect just that a small speaker with great power would recommend to buy at the same time this speaker is a must have it's portable volume is adjustable and its size makes it a must have love it thanks so much you can clip it on to your belt loop for multi room audio great for travel great sound i bet it sounds even better and louder with speakers paired simultaneously in stereo mode i can see why it won design awards i recommend the ltgem eva hard case for it love it i work outside and i like listening to the radio podcasts and just personal favorites i attatch this to my belt loop and its blasting music all day its so loud its not that uneven sound where the bass overpowers everything else or theres not enought bass no this speaker was built very well it actually looks a bit stylish too i havent tested it in the rain or anything yet i prettymuch baby it when it rains i cover it with my rain gear lol i dont want to hurt it but im sure itll work just as good i have had jbl products in the past and they always deliver works just like i expected it to i took to on my snowboarding trip it held good battery life in cold weather and sounds great i won t blow your ear drums out but it does the job love love love this speaker it has amazing sound quality and battery lasts a long time perfect i tried it under the water it has no sound under water but it doesnt break i love it and don t regret buying this speaker me as a custodian it gets boring not having music so this perfect size don t get in my way and it s pretty loud it has a great sound my only dislike is that there isn't any buttons to change to the next song other than that it's great muy buen producto for as little as it is it has nice sound and is loud sounds good for the buck the best very nice quality speaker love the sound couldn't decide between this and the bose portable but i think for the price this is a great product easy to use and connect to my phone great speaker for the size it is small and does not bother me when clipped to my pants also it gets very loud i love this speaker and would recommend to anyone as a gift they love it great sound quality size is perfect for clipping on my backback for hiking a great gift for my traveling brother in law he really thought it was neat now my husband wants one awesome speaker perfect for biking great sound and long battery life i'll definitely recommend this product for such a small speaker it has great sound and the ability to take anywhere awesome sound for such a small little guy fantastic sound daughter received this for christmas and loved it uses it all the time just received is loud light and so awesome is the perfect speaker for me sounds great fits in pocket well i haven't used the calling capabilities as of yet but the sound quality for music and videos is fantastic i used to just use the loudest setting on my phone but this sounds much better and is easy to clip on just about anything small enough to fit in the hook i'll use it to listen to music in the shower and the steam and water don't seem to affect it at all overall i suggest this product if you're looking for something portable to play audio i really like it i checked the price of this at airports or other retailers the price here is best and i love the product no negative feedback it satisfies my needs though i did not check against water i advise you to buy wow what a great little speaker don t let the size fool you this speaker is small but mighty you will not be disappointed in this speaker s performance sure it is waterproof but it has an unparalleled sound quality at a bargain price highly recommended for any music lover i bought two and they sound surprisingly good for their size i use them daily with my laptop at work and at home to compare i believe the charge sounds better but is of course very large and expensive on the other hand the clip sounds better considerably better than the flip for a case i recommend the ltgem eva hard case travel carrying storage bag works great nice and loud my son love's it great little speaker took out the box and connected to bluetooth easily sounds great for it s size highly recommended great sound and best of all great price my favorite speaker very clear great sound super portable super inexpensive good quality item from jbl its great present for boy years old this speaker is incredibly loud and is very well built i feel that if i drop this speaker it can take a hit excellent price and quality i love it this speaker sounds amazing very happy with it after the first week the built in wrap around component cord is a nice option and works great with my ipod shuffle sounds good awesome product will recommend to everyone thank you so much for the speaker i love it sounds so clear and loud for such a small thing it was a gift face cover kept coming off had to glue it almost list it several time b uh side that works well my girlfriend put one full charge on it then used it it lasted about hours of constant pandora playing when we took it on the snowboarding trip she uses it in the shower and hangs it on a hook so it has been wet and still does fine good buy it does what is is supposed to do the sound quality is lower than expected but i am not too unhappy for what i paid perfect speaker sound quality is a for you can't go wrong for the size it really puts out some good sound i use it in my camper on my bike and on my kayak the clip makes it really convenient to take anywhere fun color too loud clear and portable jbl for me has the best bluetooth speakers great for your construction worker use it everyday gave this as a gift and my dad absolutely loves it i love this it gives me just the amount of volume i need my daughter has the jbl flip and the clip as just as much volume great buy great i purchased this speaker for those times when the speaker on a phone or tablet is just not powerful enough and it is just perfect for this it has good volume and a lot more bass than you would expect for such a small speaker the fact that it is waterproof is a great feature so i have no worries using it in the kitchen or bathroom nice worked like a charm immediately love the sound i love this speaker i have had this for over a year and use it just about everyday i have dropped this many times and submerged in water and use it to shower and soap and it dries quick and is ready to go once agai the battery is quite amazing for its small size very handy accessory to carry around sounds great highly recommend it works great it was a good price and what i was looking for high quality speaker you can stream music for your phone battery seems to last only about a year with constant use but that means instead of a hour play time you get only about no other complaints this little speaker is phenomenal sounds way bigger than it is don t hesitate to buy this get it now awesome personal speaker amazing sound love it this little speaker sure puts out sound my son loves it in the bathroom love that it has a clip to hang on towel rack best sound ever don't buy anything else huge sound from little speaker a good durable speaker i have been using it every day for months in the shower outside all over my house lol it s been dropped thrown and splashed with water and it is still goin strong it stays charged for a long time review awesome sound and packs a punch for this little package sound is good quality higher great sound nice for my teen to carry in backpack a gift for my boyfriend's mom i love the color and its a very nice good quality speaker for the price i already had one of these speakers in blue and wanted a second one because you can chain two of them together via bluetooth for a higher volume it took me a little bit to get them working together but once i had it down it was easy great sound seriously waterproof usually our group uses these camping and on the water boats tubes jet skis never had an issue overall great blueooth speaker from jbl i love it it even looks cute it's easy to use and the sound quality is great plays good but the bluetooth is not working wanted small water resistant play pause volume control skip song this little thing packs a punch affordable and good quality i love it love this small bluetooth gifted to my grandson who slips it on his backpack for outside listening pleasure or just to carry around outside big sound from a small device the waterproof feature was to give a little assurance it will be around longer have had a few different style of portable bluetooth and this design is great you don't have to worry about it falling off a shelf that will break happened to the last one because you will lay it flat or find something to slip it to great product would recommend to anyone looking for a stylish portable bluetooth with a big sound excellent sound box it's the second i buy works well very good product it works fine this is the second one i bought as my brother liked it so much that took the first one handy little speaker to have good sound for the size you won't believe the quality of the sound coming out of this little guy it is so fun finding little areas that i can clip it to i even bought another one for a christmas gift great product for the shower camper next to the pool holds a good charger and puts out a fat amount of volume just got my speaker in the mail i opened it up and and was able to connect to bluetooth very easily i always have a hard time connecting other devices the sound quality is much more than i expected from a speaker that size i m excited to put this baby to use while very good amazing speaker jbl always amaze me good sound quality for its price working well sound quality is quite fair easy to use and to pair best choice to take on trips and good even for conference calls best option for its price purchased as a gift he loved it wonderful speaker clear crisp and loud very impressed with the sound this little speaker puts out pretty sure i'm ordering a second one i gave this as a gift and have received so many compliments on it i think i have to buy one for me now too great travel size good sound perfect for our trip and when we are on the dock by our lake gift love it i move it around the house as i shower get ready chores great product jbl is the best it's great can clip it on his backpack and go quick shipping high quality product very strong metal that hold the speaker everywhere easy to care great price for high quality product plenty loud and produces a great sound easily connects and love that it is so portable and has the clip sounds a little muffled but sound quality isn't going to be perfect on a little guy like this light weight and i love the fact that the aux wire is built in so you don't have to compromise water resistance if you're gonna clip it to your backpack strap near your chest or shoulders while activity ing i'd try to grab a smaller speaker as it's big enough for the flopping to get annoying bought it for on sale and i love using it while riding my bike definitely worth wouldn't pay nice very good product delivers exactly what is proposed sound is okay but it will do nice wait it is great gave as a pollyanna so not sure how it works but they seemed to have loved it very good speaker good with my phone this speaker is great i keep it in my car because my stereo isn t the best the sound is great just as if i was playing me stereo this is a very nice speaker it might be small but it packs a very powerful punch the quality and sound is great and it also has a nice clip love it dynamite little speaker with emphasis on small and versatile definetly worth the not great if you must have crystal clear highs and booming bass fantastic i love this thing and it is worth every penny i now listen to loud and non distorted music anywhere in any weather condition loved the speaker but became defective almost immediately sounds great for the size and it's crazy rugged without being bulky great for biking or hiking such great sound exactly what i ordered and works like a charm this thing is awesome i have a small addiction to portable speakers as my two favorite hobbies involve being outdoors and listening to music so when i saw this online for i couldn't resist buying it i really like the jbl brand they have good customer service and i personally believe they sound great and are great quality without the crazy price tag i have two jbl flip 's that i was using for hikes and fishing before i got this but ever since buying this guy i have left them at home for use in the back yard sorry neighbors the clip on the top makes it extremely easy to clip onto your bag or your fishing vest and the fact that it is waterproof and floats is equally amazing the battery life is pretty impressive for the size of the device and the amount of volume it puts out i believe i'm getting about hours if its fully charged and i have the thing turned all the way up another added benefit of the speaker is that if you have a friend with a nd clip or you are like myself and have multiples then you can wirelessly sync them together and play the music even louder if you are always traveling and want something that is portable or you just want quality without breaking the bank then check this guy out you will not be disappointed amazing sound for a small speaker i ve used this in the shower countless times it has fallen ok the shower still works perfectly this is a great speaker that can clik to a belt loop or backpack great sound too got this for x mas terrific little speaker i've had the original jbl micro for the past years and needed an upgrade my micro was not holding a charge for very long anymore after years of regular use not bad at all and no complaints the clip will double my old jbl micros playtime from hrs to up to hrs of play love that the clip is water proof shock resistant and very portable sound is perfect for my needs especially when you consider the size of this thing it's a very jbl sounding speaker meaning it is very bright with decent bass not a warm sound like a bose speaker for my use though this is perfect for cycling by the pool and outdoors in general as it projects the sound well only bummer is that the bottom is not flat like my micro so it does not stand upright nor does it have a kickstand to accomplish this i'll make due anyhow the clip is convenient as well attaches to almost anything great little speaker for the sound is spectacular in this tiny speaker much better than most speakers that size battery also last forever i love showering listening to tunes with it i got this speaker as a gift and when i opened it my wife ask is jbl a good brand a yes this speaker rocks great bass in such a small package and it was so easy to sync with my phone if you know anything about jbl you know it's quality this bluetooth speaker is exceptional it has bright sound crisp highs and balanced lows the clip and size are the perfect design because it allows you to take it with you easily when traveling and use it in a variety of ways for example i hang mine from my shower curtain to listen to music while i shower the battery hasn't needed to be charged yet after about hours of listening if you're in the market for a bluetooth speaker you should buy this i would pay for it if it were priced that high i bought this for my sister for christmas so she could use it on her kayak loud and clear either through the jack or the bluetooth some apps have issues with the bluetooth not sure why jbl is a brand i prefer price was fair shipped and arrived on time didn't have to battle at the mall of box store to get it the cammo design was perfect best one this is my first speaker but several of my coworkers have this one and we all love it they make bigger ones but this bagel sized beauty delivers a lotta sound pros reasonable price and worth it strong bass clear sound very mobile tough skin bluetooth or headphone jack connection usb rechargeable about hours charge connects to my android phone quickly and easily cons kinda rubbery coating gets dirty pretty fast looks dingy but easy to clean it doesn't do a great job of telling you that the battery is getting low it just shuts off only about hours of use per full charge at full volume with bluetooth connection overall i recommend this product i keep it in my purse so i'm ready to shake it off whenever the need arises d wow the sound is amazing for this little speaker we haven't tried it around water yet but so far we are totally pleased with this purchase i purchased this for my son it is very portable and waterproof my son likes sports the clip ring is suitable for hiking camping perhaps due to size issues its sound quality and volume are not as good as we expected one day i inadvertently found aomais ball speaker it is also portable ipx waterproof easy to use and have the same beautiful appearance and clip ring with jbl but what amazes me most is its superior clear sound quality and pretty good volume from the cheapest speaker stereo pairing function make you experience the true surround sound i love this feature aomais ball speaker package usb charging cable aux in cable carabineer and float accessory it has everything you want definitely worthwhile i highly recommend aomais ball speaker it will be impressed you great clarity and sound very easy to set up i am going to get another nice sound for such a small speaker this speaker puts out great sound if more than one person has has them you can link them together and get great sound very light and the clip is super convent overall love em i use this speaker every day and i love it it has really good quality and i honestly drop it and it still works the speaker doesn t go as loud as some speaker but for being compact it works amazingly all i know is that my grandson was elated with getting it amazing sound awesome speaker so loud and easy to setup i love this small bluetooth speaker and i like it has an aux cord for regular use great job jbl wonderful product easy to use my friend purchased this walked into his room the other day and thought it was tower speakers it fills up a room and easy to take anywhere good range and can't complain for the price good for bike rides too who knew so much sound could come out of such a small speaker i love how it's waterproof and so portable also you can link it to other jbl bluetooth speakers i wish the mm cord wasn't permanently attached if it gets damaged you're done battery life is great too i've written one other amazon review in the last decade that's how good this speaker is i was shocked the sound is crisp and loud especially for the size i ordered the jbl flip for my husband but it has not arrived yet and i'm honestly wondering whether or not he even needs one that large once i heard how amazing the sound is on this the attached aux cords is a good length but is easily tucked way if you're using bluetooth i do a lot of backpacking and i'm stoked to use this awesome speaker arrived very quickly such a great find i promptly oredered a nd one being delivered today great product this is the second one i got it is a great product high recommended this little speaker can move some air this is my second time getting this because my mom liked my previous one and took it away from me i wanted a speaker to use around the house so i can listen to podcasts or music while showering or cleaning my phone's speaker isn't powerful enough on its own i've bought like different rubbish no name bluetooth speakers in the past but we use a bigger jbl unit at my work and it's awesome sooo i splurged on this thing for myself and it's also pretty awesome it's not as powerful as the tube shaped ones they make and it won't make any audiophile swoon bass sounds a little blown out but it's easy to use and reasonably powerful for the size the hook is handy for attaching it to furniture or even a belt loop on your pants i will lose its connection if you wander too far from the device you're transmitting from like any such speaker but it reconnects very quickly when you're in range again i also like that it makes a little noise when its battery is running low daughter loves it soooo much says she uses it every day when she takes shower says it is great to take to the pool too this is an awesome speaker its loud and waterproof and pairs quite fast its recommended bought for my son in college great sound and he takes it in bathroom to listen to music when he showers and shaves etc leaves his phone in his bedroom no issues with steam etc he says it s a great gift and awesome quality for the money bought xmas still playing strong a year later as promised works great i use it everyday at work very good speaker for cell phone the microphone is weak so you need to speak very close to the speaker quality sound not the loudest but good sound pretty cool speaker the bluetooth doesn't work very well though i can only go a few feet away before the music starts cutting out might as well save the battery and use the built in headphone plug the speaker is waterproof but i wish it floated also the sound isn't as good as the bigger one didn't expect much though for the price this tiny little speaker sounds awesome love it i got this speaker a few weeks ago and have been using it a lot it is a decent amount bigger than the last jbl clip but is not too big or awkward and is also more sleek the buttons are setup differently as well but overall are better because you can feel them without looking the sound is much better than i expected from such a small speaker the quality is clearer and there is actually some bass that can be felt heard i mostly use it on bike rides while working out in the shower or just generally on the go and the sound is perfect for all those scenarios the carabiner feels sturdy and is bigger than on the last one so you can clip it to more things the battery life seems pretty good i used it a few hours a day for about days off the original charge that it came with i also like the fact that you can see the battery life on ios iphone s i haven t tested it in water but will update with any changes issues purchased as a gift for my year old son he loves it it's pretty durable and he likes that he can attach it to his backpack or belt loop we are all happy with the sound quality it works great for the golf course great battery as well a little bit lacking in bass compare my doss speaker which has same diameter but round like a ball but this one is loud though and much compact it's also great that it is floating in water very small in stature but kicks out some serious sound well made and very easy to carry around i carry it almost everywhere and it s pretty loud plus the color is just bomb easy to use connects fast and is great for travel projects loud and keeps the quality pushes the bass really well for as small as it is well worth the cost as described good sound excellent purchase at a good price got as gift for my mom she wouldn't know how to live with out it now great product took it on a float trip and it was dropped in the water many times and still works i've submerged it in water and pulled it out with music still playing although sounds a bit muffled but after water is dried out its better still not enough for me to not love this speaker i also use this in my garage when working and at full volume its too loud that i have to turn down a few clicks serves the purpose as a ultra portable bluetooth speaker gets decently loud and sounds really good for its size this is something you can carry in your backpack without adding much weight for anytime a small speaker is needed i have all kinds of speakers and needed a super portable one this one is perfect good price good sound great sound easily clips on my belt loop will make a great christmas gift price was great and didnt have to deal with black friday crowd to get it shipped quickly too great little speaker i got this several months ago and finally got around to using wow the sound is incredibly good i was pleasantly shocked do not let the same size fool you this speaker has big clear sound love the attached cord option good sound quality great price vs new in store i bought one for myself and now more for gifts this are one of the best speakers i ve had it s a small speaker but it s pretty powerful unless you re trying to use it for a person party it had a clip on the top so you can hang it from anything you want i always put it in my shower or in the door handle or my bag you can put it anywhere it brings an aux cord as well it s super versatile if you don t want to use your bluetooth you can just connect it through the aux cord awesome enough said this is the perfect speakers for our river trips i ve submerged it it works perfectly bought this yesterday and the sound is amazing for such a small device i love bass and this is quite impressive definitely recommend when you are teaching class and you have that one kid who is spun around in his seat and you have talked to him about it some fifty times and might need a little bonnie tyler to get your message across this is perfect i love this little speaker does the job every time turn around bright eyes turn around good sound quality and great portablilty which exceeded many other top brand in the market the waterproof feature is a bonus portable with clear sound bought for the laptop to listen to quite videos with a loud sound worth the money this speaker is great the charge lasts for hours and the sound is incredible for the size of speaker the speaker phone works really well and the built in microphone picks up my voice great this thing is grest just wanted the bigger flip from amazon this little thing is awesome i take it with me whenever i go camping and have yet to have any issues with it it puts out good strong sound and has kickass battery life it's a bit smaller than i thought but amazing sound volume and quality it fits in the palm of your hand and clips just about anywhere really surprised by it's performance stars no question love the speaker use everyday this is my go to bluetooth speaker it s louder than other speakers i ve bought plus it s cool that you can clip it and carry it easily it's really loud and you can daisy chain them it's waterproof and it's great product very loud one thing i would suggest is getting two to link them together works great dropped in ocean a few times and still worked holds charge for a long time speaker phone option works good also fantastic sound for such a small device it is pretty good it's loud but not as loud as i expected i recommend it to anyone who is thinking about buying it great little speaker waterproof too awesome alot of bang for its size i love this i use it at work i only wish it was a little louder because my work place is very noisy small with excellent sound power of watts rms the sound of this little thing is amazing it is portable and fits about anywhere with the handy clip it is a little pricey but worth it purchased as a gift he loves it love it this is one amazing little speaker great sound you have to consider it's portable not a home stereo i take it with me outside while i'm gardening bring it along camping in the boat kayaking etc the charge seems to hold well because i haven't had to charge it much at all there have only been a couple hiccups where your music blips for a second i have had other wireless speakers which worked great for a short while and then went crazy this one has been perfect so far works great wish it was a tad bit louder as i am comparing it the jbl easy to connect to bluetooth the clip makes it easy to take with you i continue to be impressed by the audio quality that comes from this little speaker for its size it sounds remarkably good it feels high quality as well i love the built in aux cable for when im in a pinch but hope it hold up over time this was purchased for a disabled person to communicate with it is very good with both speaking and sound there is very little delay so words come out clearly enough to be understood music is lovely on this speaker as well this little radio is amazing it's loud enough and perfect to take along to the beach or the ski slope love it it was a great buy great sound syncs easily to any device for the money and convenience this is an excellent speaker i got it for my daughter who is in college i was truly surprised by how good the sound is great item nice and loud perfect for taking along for a bike ride excelent product everything ok spoiler alert it is not as loud or full as the larger jbl and some other speakers however it does the job just fine for me i use it golfing on my own which is often i clip it on my golf bag behind my towel and facing towards me so far it out lasts the phone battery easily so i am getting a different charge case for the iphone if i had more room though i know a guy that just hangs his speaker in a mesh bag on the push cart or if i wanted to spend more money i would get the jbl that charges the phone as well that said i am happy with my purchase i often travel with my back pack sometimes only with a pack this will fit nicely clipped to a pack happy trails great sound its great to hang on a belt loop and bags but its not as loud as another speaker i have i love that its water proof that definitely makes up for it thanks is perfect working and perfect delivery and pakeging great little reliable and durable speaker best sound i could find in a small and affordable speaker love it for travel and also to pair with a laptop while watching movies got it for my husband as a present he loves it hes able to work outside and listen to all his music without cords it soynds awesome hw really cranks it up too i drive a lot during the day for work a speaker for bluetooth channeling of ipad audio is what i was looking for i wanted a powerful speaker and own a jbl clip already this little round speaker is listed as watts i got an oontz angle ultra oontz angle ultra portable bluetooth speaker excellent stereo sound rich bass watt loud volume ' bluetooth range play to two together splashproof by cambridge soundworks which is listed at watts same price at w vs w the little jbl clip is perceptibly equally loud and has better high volumes tolerance the sound is stable at maximum volume unlike the other speaker i've gotten it in the rain but haven't used it in the shower i like my electronics to be waterproof regardless this clip is ingeniously placed all mobile speakers should have handles great travel speaker most of all the sound quality is so far unmatched against the altec lansing mini lifejacket philips bt b and the ooztz ultra much clearer with less distortion with just w i'd like to compare this to comparably bose soundlink micro waterproof bluetooth speaker black if anyone has done a comparison leave a comment please i found out it's not worth using bluetooth at all and that just plugging a double ended mm headphone cord into the car stereo aux jack and the other end into the ipad iphone set the phone ipad volume to max and use the car stereo volume control to adjust volume it is hands down the easiest cheapest way to play music in a car with an iphone or ipad i'll use this one while hiking and transport it back and forth to my desk where it hangs the other's i'll sell great speaker this speaker was wearing beyond and above my expectations very good has very good clarity great speakers i started buying these small jbl speakers about years ago i have dropped and broken a few but this newer design is great very durable long battery life charge and good quality sound the clip is handy and i can go quite a distance from my ipad or phone and still maintain a solid bluetooth connection very good quality sound ok trying to jump into st century and this is easy to operate sound is great i have had a lot of speakers and this one is one of my favorites with it having a clip i can always hook it to my shorts and be able to be hands free and listen to music anytime since it is waterproof i don't have to worry about it being outside it is very loud and clear for its size as well the bluetooth sometimes fades in and out even when my phone is right next to it but it works pretty much perfectly other than that amazing speaker it sounds great feels really rugged the water resistance is an awesome feature i originally had the jbl clip which recently died on me i decided to upgrade to this considering how good the clip had been this only improves on the original the clip has an upgraded design and fixes all of the qualms i had with the clip these were namely the lack of water resistance and the poor quality clip the speaker sounds great and can fill a small room i love it and use it daily the only qualm i have with this one is that the status light is on the bottom not on the top like the old model this is probably because of water resistance purposes but i liked the light on the top more the box is named in was scratched everywhere but the speaker is great and sounds louder than i expected super happy with the purchase i bought it to be used exclusively in my bathroom as it is waterproof i haven't got an issue with the steam and humidity of the shower it sounds loud and feels sturdy jbl ftw best speakers i ever bought getting a second one to link with the first is a great idea for an almost surround sound room filling amazing bass have it hanging on my camelback while hiking live this product speaker is loud easy to carry anywhere i have had one of these speakers for two years it still works great but its gotten hard to get it to charge the battery still runs for ten hours at a low volume four to five at max volume i use it everyday clips to my safety vest or anything else near me so nice to not be hooked to wires great sound lightweight i work in construction and it takes a beating i got my new one from amazon deal stop it arrived before expected and is excactly what i wanted nice sound for such a small speaker easy to use feels nice to the touch i just love this very nice portable speaker yet sounds very powerful i take this to all over my house when i clean house or read book in the patio or during cooking especially long driving i must have this oh yeah i love this product so easy to set up with my phone and so easy to charge etc all exceptionally good great sound as well quality all the way for having only a speaker only needs words to describe it this thing rocks i take it everywhere in and out my house thank you this is the best small portable speaker keep it with me for presentations in small conference rooms all the time sound and volume is amazing well worth it have used many other speakers but this is the best for weight and room in the briefcase when i am traveling this speaker is awesome nice loud sound not earth shaking bass but loud enough for me to hear my music and talk radio while i work i've owned other small speakers on the past ie mini jambox and this one sounds the best plus the clip makes it easier to carry around glad i purchased this speaker i cannot get this to work with my samsung smart phone the volume won't work i apologize my fault sorry works great great sounding and my phone connected and the camouflage is so nice i love this thing i think it sounds as good as my flip perfect for camping canoe kayaking the shower etc everything s great star hold both buttons down for seconds like instructions say yep i m an idiot was great speaker but i bought two to sync together what a pain nothing on you tube for the clip nothing when you google only other jbl speakers and the method they use does not work for this speaker buy one but don t bother with cause they don t sync together frustrating stars because of the fact they won t sync love it great sound and battery life for its size i dig that it is waterproof and so far has held up to shower and use while washing the car this thing has a great battery life i clip it to my bike and to my shower curtain and it has never given me any issues the bluetooth connects exceptionally fast and this thing sounds great for as small as it is the only thing i don't really like about it is the sound it makes when the battery is low i would like to change it to something less annoying or at least be able to make it not beep as frequently but this issue isn't even worth removing a star i love this speaker i use for talk radio rush from my phone it's great awesome speaker great sound easy to pair clips right onto my bookbag and im ready for wherever small but great speaker perfect for pool parties and outdoor adventures base is pretty decent and the speaker gets much louder than expected my yr old did a lot of research before spending his money on this speaker he absolutely loves it sound is very clear and he said set up was easy easy to use and great for outdoor use particularly i use it when out golfing it clicks on the golf bag or on a handle in the cart very easily great product no issues very loud and durable i'm a mechanic and this speaker takes a beating the down side is battery life about hrs on loudest and a bit over priced good speaker have a great battery life and the camo one looks fantastic excelente such a convenient little speaker stars because the speaker cover fell off of it after months of use but i clipped it back on and it hasnt come off since little but loud speaker very good build i hung it on the shower curtain ring and used it during showering and no problem great little speaker would be better with the song skip options seen on the altec speakers no extra buttons needed i did buy it for using it on a jet ski idk what i was expecting buy you can only really hear the music when traveling at really low speeds it's loud for its size but i guess i was hoping for something a bit louder excellent awesome speaker great price we've had this at the pool use it in the house and outside at parties loud enough for everyone to hear and easy to control with phone or on the speaker itself works very well nice design bought this for my daughter to use on her jet ski she absolutely loves it i was surprised at the volume and sound quality great sound perfect for a speaker conference phone it s good and useful i lost it sounds good work really well with the echo dot i love this speaker and it s waterproof so it s perfect for biking just load enough for it s size and very cool looking and rugged arrived fast works great great little speaker fantastic sound with long play time highly recommend my daughter has one also which convinced me to buy one nice speakers works great easy to setup loud keeps power for a long time light weight in other words exactly what i needed for long bike rides it's much easier to ride with music top works great clip it to my golf bag during a round the music keeps me calm while i chase the stupid white ball excellent sound good quality i love the clip very convenient great speaker made for an awesome gift jbl pulled together a great product here great sound at a great price love it daughter loves it muy buena i bought this one for a friend of mine out of town so i was unable to evaluate it my friend was telling how unbelievable the sound was i bought one also they were right nice clear sound i like it all is good with this little speaker the only thing i would recommend to change is that even if my phone is set to silent it still rings through the speaker other than that it is a fantastic little buddy for bike rides climbs small cook outs and a trip to the community pool i love it just wish it was a little louder but it's very convenient and simple i also love how you can connect more than one device this works perfectly and projects great sound we use it on our boat in the summer and outside when we are working in the yard i haven't reviewed many products but this one deserves it it's easy to use easy to connect and we haven't had a single problem out of it since i purchased it months ago i won the jbl clip on an online instant win game and really wasn't expecting much due to the size of it boy was i wrong i paired it with my phone and i was shocked at the quality of the sound coming out of this little speaker it was crisp clear had good bass and was loud plus it's water proof up to ft of water it also floats i recommend this little powerhouse to anyone who likes quality sound i'm definitely glad i got one replaced similar unit that died works great sound is good especially at this price point its great sound is decent small yet powerful it was an added plus while on the beach can't wait to use it again great sound and the battery lasts a long time perfect for the shower i bought this speaker at best buy and i absolutely love it it sounds awesome for it's size and even better if you echo it the design is cute and it is def water proof and continues to work after being submerged for minutes would buy again love this little speaker easy and so portable i have had this speaker for a long time now i work outside in an auto shop in the texas heat and humidity and i've never had an issue the volume is nice and loud and the built in aux cable is a god send the bluetooth connection is good for up to about feet but the draw back is using the bluetooth will drain your battery faster it's about hours on bluetooth but when using the aux cable overall this speaker is a workhorse and a quality product crazy good sound comes from this little speaker gets really loud and clarity is amazing being waterproof makes it great for the shower or a day out in the kayak gift for my grandson he loved it exactly what i wanted a must buy it's a great speaker but i was thinking even for the price and size it'd have more umf to the sound other than that it's fairly easy to use it even survived a recent rain and several falls to the hard floor the sound quality is beautiful and crisp for its size i was expecting it to be slightly louder than it is auxiliary is even better sound quality but still just as quiet unfortunately there are no other models that are this size i might opt for one of the bigger models later this year as the one i have is still very useful and convenient to my needs it worth my wife loves this speaker really fun little speaker great to use outdoors and on trips perfect excellent product no issues so far great sound for the size hang off your bike back pack or golf cart great value for the price great great but bass isn't as good as the jbl clip disappointed in that everything else is on point it's worth buy it now great little speaker it's easy to carry around and has a good sound i use it out by the pool and in the shower and have had no issues excellent speaker it gets very loud and the audio quality is amazing much improved on the version great sound and battery life this speaker has been a fantastic very versatile bluetooth speaker i have used it almost daily for over years it sounds great with all genres of music and the bass is great for its size the big thing that makes the jbl clip so exceptional is its durability i have dropped it in a pond dropped it down a flight of concrete stairs and turned it up to full volume for hours on end and after years it's still going strong would definitely recommend amazing sound quality the sound is not high but the quality is amazing it's lightweight sound is great i was expecting a better battery life but i decided to be a little realistic i mean look at its size it's not a tesla looks good too and that carabineer wonderful sound from such a small unit great volumn absolutely in love with this speaker initially i was going to buy the ue boom for my bestfriend's birthday but after i compared it to jbl's speaker i bought this in my perspective jbl's speaker sounded a lot crisper and clearer than that of the ue not to mention the bass was far superior on the clip as well for a better speaker at a cheaper price i made the right decision great speaker bit the money it should have a ad slot to download music this clip is a fantastic piece of equipment the sound quality is much better than anything on comparable price the bluetooth connection is stable the microphone for using it as a speakerphone is especially impressive its only flaw is that when left connected to a charger for too long it will disable itself you know this has happened because the indicator light is flashing alternating between blue and red the only fix is to let the battery drain taking approximately a day and a half and then recharging more carefully the jbl clip exceeded all my expectations with respect to the overall sound quality and design of the unit the portability of the unit is also very convenient it may be small but it packs a wallop just buy it awesome speaker and lightning fast shipping great quality and plenty loud for my needs cute color too really happy with this purchase i love it so much louder than jbl plus and what more it is good for deaf can heard better with music i did put jbl plus with bluetooth and plug in aux that's two times louder in the car wow great speaker for the price not as loud as i hoped but for the size it is definately loud has some good base compared to others but personally would have liked a little bit more and gone for the flip for a little more but in the right evironment this will definately do this is definitely something i would recommend if you re looking for a portable bluetooth speaker that not only delivers premium quality but is also waterproof thank you this speaker is great nice and clear sound perfect gift loud and easy instructions husband love it i love my jbl clip worked wonderfully at the pool and beach this summer and though i didn't dip it in any water the fact that it is waterproof eased my worries during my time at a beachhouse for a week the sound is very decent no as loud as the jbl flip but still great sound quality would definitely recommend bought this about a month ago to have a portable speaker hang onto my tool belt works and sounds great i had a sound link mini which sounds fantastic but it was just too damn heavy to carry around and i also wasn't able to charge it via usb needs to plug into outlet so i bought this and plenty of other small usb charged portable speakers and the clip by far sound the best out of the other ones of which i've returned for its size it's handles bass very well with very little distortion even at high volumes all while having the clarity music deserve and believe me this thing get loud it's extremely light hr battery usb charged waterproof can also be daisy chained and all under bucks again for its size and price it's the best little speaker out there hands down great sound great price great mixer we have made a lot of smoothies easy to clean and use there's not really anything to be said that hasn't been said already it's a fantastic blender that is sturdy powerful and easy to clean i love this thing i couldn't imagine my life without it now awesome blender i received this blender as a gift about two weeks ago and have used it a dozen times since this is a great blender it blends well blends quick and is easy to clean the main reason i'm writing this review is to address the number of people complaining about the blade assembly popping out and cutting them this blender is purposely designed to make the blade assembly easy to remove for cleaning when the top is off the blade assembly can be lifted out of the container without any resistance the blade assembly is locked in by the top which securely latches to the container the top has a pouring spout so you can leave the top on while your pour your drink this is all clearly explained in the instructions no one should ever take off the top to pour their drink the blender works great great blender no issues easy to clean and use super best damn blender it doesnt completely emulsifiy it's not a juicer lol but it is amazing especially for the price awesome wish i owned one earlier i haven't tried blending ice cubes yet but it works great with frozen fruit and leafy greens way better than my old black and decker blender woooo look at them there blades spin if you are used to throw away units this will blow your mind i bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and he absolutely loves it he uses it all the time i love my new blender use it daily to make smoothies this blender works pretty good good buy very nice works great and blends fruit smooth this thing is incredible the stacked blades mix and blend like no other blender i own or have owned great job ninja robust easy to use easy to clean this was a good choice love this thing use it every morning best blender i've ever had i always shed a single tear because of how great it is excellent love love love my ninja it's the perfect size and grinds up great this thing is a beast crushes ice cubes and turns frozen fruit into a smoothie in seconds exactly what i expected everything i expected it to be and more use this alllll the time to make fruit veggie smoothies and baby food for our quadruplets never had any issues with the blade just make sure it's on there right and you will be fine very durable and reliable we bought this afternoon going through two bullet style blenders in two years the motors on those would burn out don't waste your time with one of those this one is much sturdier better design super powerful gets the job done excellent ice crushing abilities comparable to the vitamix brand honestly i'd take this ninja over a vitamix any day does exactly the same thing for a fraction of the price one thing to beware of it that the blades are super freaking sharp so be really careful when you wash them three people in my family cut their fingers pretty badly while washing the blender this thing is a beast probably good if you're making a large smoothie but not very good for small batches like a single margarita there is a place on the back to wrap the cord but if you do the cord will not last too long the cord is unstranded aluminum a cheap unsuitable alternative to stranded copper the best the very best blender i ve ever had and i m still impressed with the price the power the multiple blades and the performance of this machine leave nothing unblended nothing negative yet and don t expect anything one nice fillip is the impression the ninja makes on guests wow you need a pilot s license to fly this and several asked if they could make their own smoothies based on my experience you will not be disappointed with this ninja and i have to admit i like that it impresses my guests and it is real easy to operate hard to clean the glass because of the material but it's really nice for alcoholic milkshakes family loves it great at making smoothies and crushing ice just too loud still a stars for performance it's a mac daddy of blenders this thing is a beast and i love it i mostly use it for smoothies in bulk or puree stuff for soup like cooked squash this ninja is awesome i've always had cheap blenders before this is my first step up i have been making smoothies like a boss the blades are super sharp and i slice my fingers every time i clean it but i attribute that to my own stupidity we've been battling our blender's ability to crush ice for years since our kiddos are huge smoothie fans and we enjoy frozen drinks we needed a blender that could get the job done without leaving chunks of ice and a metallic smell in the air after reading the stellar reviews and watching the impressive ice crushing infomercial we decided to invest in a ninja when this particular model had a flash sale we pulled the trigger pros it crushes ice and frozen fruit like a powerhouse leaving no chunks behind the blade design is brilliant easy to insert and remove with one fluid movement just don't forget to put blade in before blending blade removal makes pouring scraping and cleaning easy be careful it's sharp secured top system locks out leaks and splashes flip spout allows small food items and liquid to be added while blending has the ability to pulse or run blender hands free holds a ton of liquid great for lots of people cons if not full dry items spinach will jump to the top and stick to the sides requiring stopping and stirring manually does not pair with individual blending cups as recommended by amazon cord is too short difficult to accommodate to outlet given the price tag this blender is well worth the money when entertaining and blending for groups it gets the job done quickly and efficiently and crushes ice like magic cleanup is easy simply rinse the extremely sharp blade and air dry on counter and throw the pitcher in the dishwasher because of the excellent top lock feature and no openings on pitcher base little to no residue gets on the base i love this blender but if i had it to do all over again i would bypass this model and order an all in one ninja blender that has the option of using smaller cups for individual drinks our smoothie blending would take much less time if the area inside the pitcher cup was filled with more food liquid so that sides didn't need to be scraped of spinach plus we'd have the added individual smoothie cups for our two children allowing them to choose the ingredients inside while they're battling over smoothie choices my husband and i could enjoy blending frozen margaritas in a bigger pitcher amazon please stop pairing it with the tritan nutri ninja cups they're not compatible with this unit bottom line ninja packs a punch i've never seen with other blenders it's my new brand of choice excellent blender for the price really grinds ice firm vegetables well however you must be extremely careful the blades are super sharp i cut myself badly on the first use love it my favorite kitchen appliance first of all this is my first blender that was manufactured later than the s thanks mom for the hand me down osterizer i am a product of the s so yeah obviously much improved i've been excited to get up this past week to make my coffee smoothies before work it is loud i hope that my neighbor doesn't hear it downstairs but i don't know if there is such thing as a blender that can quietly chop up ice one of my cats watches me prep my smoothie but runs when i turn it on and the other cat runs over to see what is making that noise so it's tolerable for a non fraidy cat i've read reviews of complaints that the blade doesn't snap in and people have cut their hands so i was nervous about that but i sat down and read the instruction manual all the way through and it states it a bunch of times that the blade doesn't snap in and to lift it out before you pour with the lid off so i've paid very close attention to that always be sure to read instructions reviews have complained that the blender somehow broke within weeks of purchasing it if you read the instructions you'll see to register it within days and they have a one year warranty i highly recommend this blender and it's super affordable my mom said her vitamix heats up whatever she puts in it so i was worried my smoothie might come out warm but it stays cold maybe it's a better blender for of the cost pro tip from mom after using fill the blender with warm water a little bit away from the top with a tiny amount of dish soap and run on high and it washes out the pitcher use it as a food processor as well and just love it makes a smooth smoothie and isn't too loud while doing it my granddaughter make smoothies every day after school and its works perfectly i will eventually use it for other things also very strong and really good price for it this is the first legit blender i ve ever owned we always bought the cheap ones at walmart and it did the job but took forever this one is amazing blends so quickly and thoroughly can add in all the ingredients at once without worry of clogging or anything i use it at low speed always because even at that setting it gets the job done quick now i m certain some of you are now anxious about the horror stories you re seeing on the reviews of cut fingers and toes i was too but my mom bought this for me and swore by it because she has one i m starting to think the injuries are mainly user error don t try hand washing these blades first of all you will likely cut yourself due to slippery metal i wash mine by adding hot water soap and blending it a few times never had an issue with residue granted i don t have a dish washer so if you do use that now as for the blades popping out yes they can easily do that but only if you re tipping the blender upside down without the lid on or properly locked on if you have to pour your smoothie or whatever out there s a specific opening in the lid for you to do this safely don t remove the entire lid and pour this will definitely make the blade pop out i just received the blender today and used it for the first time i love it so much it works exactly as i hoped it chops whole frozen fruit in seconds thank you works well if you put in spinach there will be bits seen rather than truly emulsified but works very well this blender changed my life i make smoothies milkshakes sauces and soups it's a great blender at a great price i am replacing a kitch aid which has the plastic cog on the bottom of the jar this is definitely quieter and blends much better i like the twist to lock and turn on if the jet is not attached properly the unit will not start the lock down top prevents any sudden splashes and the removable blades make cleaning easy do be careful the blades are very sharp love my blender this product was received in a reasonable amount of time it was very well packaged works very well and easy to clean up afterwards love my blender powerful machine great for making slushies and frozen treats easy to clean b c you just rinse it off with water immediately afterwards no problems easy to figure out if you are blending berries the seeds will still be there in the final product but not a huge deal works fast and very well very powerful blender love it super product works great fro my morning smoothies easy clean up super safety features the look is good the cup size is great blades are many but didn't blend my green smoothie like my old bullet i just happy i can make it in one shot and not have to mix half than the other have of items this blender is exactly as advertised i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a top notch blender at a reasonable price i ve had mine fort three weeks now and have used it almost every day just what she needed works great and chops up everything without having to shake the blender excellent product just what i expected this thing is a beast it will chew through just about anything you can throw at it excellent sleek look and performance is awesome well worth the cost loved it love it its exactly what i needed i read all the reviews before purchasing a ninja unfortunately it has not arrived yet and i am eager to try it out apparently being a ninja user makes you a comedian the reviews were a scream everyone in my office wanted to know why i was laughing out loud my advice is to read the reviews on this product for a good laugh this product arrived on time started using on first day received no complaints at all works great on smoothies as well as shakes no problem mixing anything you put in the blender have already recommended to friends perfection large square basin allows you to add lots of ingredients having multiple vertical blades allows it to blend everywhere not just at the bottom like most blenders super easy to clean i absolutely love this blender all my smoothies have been perfect consistency i haven't tried to make anything else though this baby is loud even on the lowest setting it startled you awake that's for sure so if you live in a shared space with a roommate or light sleeper you'll get complaints but overall this blender is the best i've ever owned so far so good just got it makes me smoothies the way they should be great blender everything that i hoped it would be just got this and have only used it once but it worked great this is a great machine for chopping up a variety of products price is right absolutely love me ninja it's so powerful and is such a wonderful blender great quality and perfect size for anything you might need to blend up coming from a year old sears blender this is just amazing the levels of blades are spread out evenly from top to bottom avoiding any dead spots when you engage the awesome power of this blender the multiple safety lockouts were keenly thought out even the top has to be locked in place for this instrument to engage shift it into gear and you'll be doing miles per hour ninja professional blender bl this is fantastic works great after some of the reviews i'm hoping it stay great works very well for fruit and veggie smoothies i love this blender i had a ninja blender from like years ago that i purchased for like and it never broke i finally decided i need to get a new one because the blades were getting old but they still worked already blended tons of shakes such a great product with a awesome price point i would never spend on some of these advertised blenders this one works just as well and for a great prices and yes i make tons of shakes with hard and frozen veggies excellent products i got this from amazon warehouse deals it's a bit noisier than i expected it would be does a fair job blending up kale smoothies i would think for the power and number of blades it would do a better job but it's just so so i don't find it hard to clean i rinse it out good then run it with hot water and a little dish soap and then scrub around on the lid and it comes out perfectly clean great quality makes fantastic smoothies and shakes best blender ever i bought this for my wife so she could make smoothies we had a different blender before and it burned up perhaps from using too thick of food this blender has no problem what so ever handling frozen foods thick foods or anything love it and would buy again if we ever needed a new one or a second one i've used this at least days a week since i bought it last year and i love it i have a green smoothis every morning and this is such a powerful machine no issues so far its a great blender this is the best blender i have ever had by far i think it may be better than the juicing machines the secret is the multi tiered blades the top blade is almost at the top no matter what you put in it grabs it and grinds it up frozen leafy hard soft whatever you never have to push the load down this blender makes perfect smoothies out of frozen fruit without any extra fiddling leafy stuff like kale can be added in at the top and it just sucks it down and grinds up amazing it has lots of power it does not slow down on a full load of frozen fruit even though the container is plastic it seems very strong i have had my blender over year and the container is in perfect condition no cracks or scratches when it does frozen fruit it makes a loud noise like rocks are being thrown around inside but then it quiets down after everything is ground into smaller pieces the best smoothy maker ever works wonderful blades very sharp so be careful how you handle it but works great i looked at all the different blenders and just wanted to make almond milk didn't want to spend a lot of money and this lookef like a good choice to start with i soaked my almonds and peeled all the skin off by hand like in the youtube videos and this blender worked great for the rest of it i can't speak of how it would work otherwise but i am happy with it so far it was just delivered today and i have only used it once but it was smooth powerful and all that i could ask for this point i am happy that i spent my money on this instead of spending a few hundred dollars with appliances longevity is a big part of it but so far this has worked well if you pulsed it a few times and then run it long enough for liquify it does a good job for smoothies and ice drinks one thing people tend to underestimate is the amount of time yo should run a blender for smooth drinks which we were taught in bartending school was usually minutes but i always see people running seconds and wonder why it s lumpy generally if ice or frozen fruits are involved you can hear when it s done i really like the locking mechanism both for the lid and the base and it s one of the best pouring blenders i ve used other than the really expensive ones great product works great the blades are very sharp i'm loving it recently had to look for a new blender when my vitamix started overheating and shutting down with very limited use i considered getting a new vitamix but thought for a fraction of the cost why not try out the ninja so far i have been favorably impressed it's not nearly the power of my vitamix w vs w but for what i need to do it has worked fantastically i mainly use it for grinding up fresh coconut meat to make coconut oil and for that task so far it has worked fantastically i like that it doesn't get air pockets like my vitamix used to get all the time the only thing i don't like about it is that i can't take off the top of the pitcher while it's blending like i could with my vitamix i liked being able to take a spatula and push the stuff sticking on the top sides down while it's blending now i have to turn it off to do this not a deal breaker for me though warning there are a lot of blades and they are very very sharp sliced my finger the first time i tried cleaning it incredible looks very solid and it is as simple as it needs to be just speeds the jar the lid and the base all fit very well i wish i had bought it at first time before our kitchenaid blender the way it is made makes it really easy to clean as you take the blades out of the jar so you don't hurt cut the fingers while trying to clean the botton of the jar great bargain this is the strongest blender i have ever owned worth the price best blender i have ever owned mixes up and smooths veggies and fruits perfectly and holds a bunch definitely recommend this this thing is a beast highly recommend this is absolutely wonderful having blades all the way up the shaft make this one of the best items in my kitchen i barely have to turn it on to achieve the perfect mix i haven't begun to use it in the many ways it can work the price was terrific i believe it was on sale well worth this well made appliance wonderful product solid and powerful i also have a nutri bullet i like it but the ninja is in another class altogether love it great for protein shakes and then for happy hour i resisted buying a ninja for years because i didn't believe that they were really that much better then a standard blender but when my old blender broke after a decade of use and i started looking for a new one i couldn't resist the deal i found on this now i understand the hype behind the ninja's they are powerful machines the triple blade is such an ingenious concept and i'm glad i decided to try it out i don't think i'll ever be able to go back to another brand blender after this so worth it this is truly a great blender powerful and sturdy has several layers of cutting knives no more stuck veggies that have to be pushed down to the bottom so far it is doing its job and we like it this product is great the top part is super easy to remove and it crushes ice wonderfully clean up is easy as well hands down the best blender i have ever used great product zero complaints i love it works as expected i've turned into a smoothie machine lol very powerful blender have had mine for months and it still works perfectly very simple and easy to use blades are sharp but if used correctly and safely you won t get injured just what i wanted this is a beast so glad i bought it love this blender i mainly make smoothies and it does a great job of chopping everything extremely fine works great kinda big and bulky so far it works and does it well not sure if worth it regular price on sale it is a great buy this is by far the best blender i've ever used the multiple blades make all the difference making creating smoothies etc so easy my ninja blender works wonders for my green and fruit smoothies easy to use and to clean great very powerful be careful when washing blades are very sharp this is the first ninja blender i've ever purchased i found it to be extremely well made heavy duty isle of the easily removable beater blades which are extremely high quality and how snug the blender sits on the base and how snug the lid secures to the blender plus it is very quiet use this daily works great quick to ship and product just as described awesome blender product is working well no complaints great blender excellent price wow this blender is great goes through ice and frozen fruit like butter i'm pretty clumsy and i have yet to cut myself on the blades you just have to be careful also it has a pour spout on the top so you won't cut yourself while pouring i love this thing it does it all powerful easy to clean and does the job i just got it and have been using it every day worked perfectly works great thank you good love this blender and great price works great i love that the blades are very sharp this blender is awesome blends very well very easy to put together and clean works great blends everything really well great product i use it nearly every day great price too very powerful easy to use i've been using this blender for months and it works great i use it every morning to for a shake carrot apple kale banana oats and liquids sharrrp i was concerned when i received it that it felt pretty lightweight but i've been careful and it still works excellently love this blender however the top of the pitcher just broke after approx uses seems like a common problem beware update ninja is sending me a free replacement pitcher thank you ninja its a great blender i will take it super easy on the new pitcher not sure why the locking tab broke the plastic isn't super strong try non to overfill the pitcher when blending great blender crazy powerful great blender we use it nearly every day item arrived as advertised very pleased with product i have used it once because i already had one it's as good as my other which is a ninja great ninja i've gone through so many blenders in the past most of them would crack or burn out quick this blender seems to be a monster though tested it out by making wine margaritas first and i am impressed we'll see how it holds up over time with smoothies and shakes this blender is magic i use this product everyday for smoothies the blades are strong and can crush through ice very fast its amazing best bender i have purchased by far best blender ever super quiet my husband loves it this thing will blend anything fast smoothies instead of coffee have made me a better person use it every day i am sure there are many different recipes out there and this blender will handle them i've been making a smoothie every day since receiving this and i love it it blends everything smoothly and quickly it is loud but it works great bought for my daughter and her family she reports this blender is a wiz at making slushies and smoothies best blender i've ever owned using it for keto a lot made mashed cauliflower chopped chicken in it low carb smoothies ice you name it love it i love love love this blender ice spinach frozen or raw veggies it blends it all so smoothly works great it is just really loud very good good quality with powerful motor this is a large powerful blender that works very well for its size however the plastic bowl is rather light and fragile which could explain why some crack under use a thicker plastic at least at the base by the motor would certainly help firstime users need to get familiar with the shaft and blade combination the drive shaft on this model has tiers of blades which come up halfway in the bowel the drive shaft extends entire length of bowl and actually pivots on the top cover model if the cover is not secure the blender will not operate safety measure also if turn over to rinse out shaft and blade combination will fall out not locked to base as in most blenders blades are sharp and must excersize care to hold and assemble the blades are so sharp and it s easy to clean i'm in love with ninja professional blender cream soup are the best with ninja and our favorite is lemonade with raspberry easily the most expensive blender i've owned as a former barista i was used to using a vitamix but refused to spend the money on it this works wonderful for my x a day smoothies love this thing works great read reviews and performs as expected this was a bargain deal very happy really liked this blender but decided i would not use it so i sent it back for a refund i love it's very powerful so far so good i ve been experimenting with recipes i m not disappointed i love it be careful of the blades it washes up easy and is easy to use definitely worth the money works great i use it almost every day and it keeps up with me simple controls cleans easily too i love this blender it is great quality and it is powerful the best great product love it the ninja pro blender is easy to use and best of all easy to clean without worrying about motor unit my previous blender required to tighten lid with blade and rotary unit the lid would leak and can damage motor unit i had problems tightening lid the ninja pro blender solved my problems when using a blender love it really does grind ice so worth the price the inner blades easily remove making the clean up much easier quickly crushes and grinds ice to make a smoothy truly smooth and not lumpy i love this blender plenty of power my husband is doing many new receipes wonderful blades up the shaft obliterates the ice fruits and vegetables instantly without a struggle i like the smoothness of the power it has it's touchy to handle the blade unit but very washable and good looking too i love making my green juice in my new blender this blender is incredible and worth every penny so happy and my kids love the green juice great product and super easy transaction thanks just as good as the higher priced ninja works great this guy is pretty bad ass we had a cheap oster for years and i was super excited when it finally bit the dust we were going to get a vitamix but i just can't justify spending that much on a blender this has held up really well to daily smoothie making the blades are really sharp and haven't dulled yet i wish the container part was glass though awesome power makes great smoothies very easy to clean this blender does that job it really blends anything the only thing is u have to care for when u clean it the blades are literally sharp other than that is a great product i am very happy with it good product exceeded expectations works perfectly i use this for seed milk and it works great very powerful use every day love this thing best if there is a model with volts i absolutely love my ninja love the spout that allows me to pour stuff out without having to take the top off it blends things pretty good not as good as a vita mix but good enough for my needs now i can make my smoothies for a week i love my ninja i use it a lot and sometimes with frozen foods it's not too loud i had an issue with the lock mechanism after months of constant use customer service was excellent and they provided a replacement of the broken part to me free of charge blends things like a ninja this is a very nice blender makes my smoothies with ease and clean up is a breeze i really feel like it is well worth the cost the blender is fantastic it makes creamy smoothies in just seconds and is very easy to clean and maintain we love it i've had this a few months and use it mainly for morning protein smoothies it does a great job and seems to have plenty of power compared to my old blender it's maybe too powerful because when i hit even low power it goes so fast and hard that it blends a lot of air into the smoothie now i try to just give it a few pulses of power so i don't get a blender full of air this blender is awesome use it primarily for smoothies it is a very powerful blender just be careful when cleaning the blender since the blades are very sharp finally i can make a quick easy smoothie effortlessly it s powerful does the job in seconds i don t have to take the lid off times during the process to shove the ice or fruit down lower towards the blades to make sure it all gets in this pulls everything together on its own and you have a perfect smoothie within seconds to a minute the blade isnt the typical small little attached piece on the bottom it s a long blade that is removeble which makes the whole process much easier and blends evenly no more shoving it all to the bottom love it easy to assemble easy to clean pieces you can toss it right in the dishwasher when you are done received on time and it is exactly what i was expecting great product and one powerful machine it is very good i love this thing i haven't had any issues locking the blinder you have to match up the two arrows to prevent spilling issues i think people reported spillages without evaluating the top all the way through this blender works really well it makes my smoothies so much faster than my old one easy to clean too this blender is amazing it crushes ice frozen fruit and nuts into my smoothies almost immediately i have never had such a good blender look no further this is the one to buy i love this blender why pay for the vita one when you can get this it's so nice and great price satisfied works just as advertised and very durable day four of using it and it seems to be pretty awesome chews up everything in sight this thing is a beast crushes ice like a hammer due to its two sets of blades one at the bottom and one set midway up hummus mo problem smoothie ain t no thang margarita girl i gots you great price for a blender i didn't blend my iphone yet but i will try once my wife goes away if it blends why pay dollars for a blender when you can pay way less than that anything can blend food im going to try and blend my phones and some bricks and see if the blades last love it i always wanted a powerful blender but all of them are so expensive anyway i bumped into this one and when i saw the reviews and the price i said i can't say no to this i am very happy with this as soon as it arrived or days maybe i wash it and the first thing i did was to do the ice test of course hmmm frozen strawberry margaritas smothies etc well with a little bit of noise my dog ran away to my daughter's room it passed the ice test in seconds i had crushed ice the next step was to instruct my daughter to never ever put her hands inside the container no matter what even if is not on she looked at me with big open eyes yes never these are extra sharp blades this morning i prepared my first smoothie kale carrots pear honey banana and ice i will not say the drink is delicious but the blender did his job in seconds all the fruits and veggies were crushed and blended you will not be disappointed go for it easy to use powerful and easy to clean very durable and doesn t struggle at all very great blender i do wish i would have gotten the most powerful version to be able to make perfect peanut butter but this does a pretty darn good job i can't really throw anything at this thing to slow it down except that time i accidently left a metal spoon in there but even then i took it out and it continues to run like a champ almost an entire year of using it times a day and it's a beast works great and it does what it says it will do very happy with it i absolutely love this awesome blender there are two types of blenders out there one that crushes ice and one that dosen t this blender crushes ice i upgraded my old blender to this one when i learned my last cheaper blender would not crush ice ice would melt before the old blender crushed it lol the blades come out to make cleanup easier as well just be careful if you forget to pull the blades out and turn it upside down the blades will fall out it dose not have a lock in place option i can see how someone can cut themselves if they forget i removed one star for this otherwise as for the blender itself it s incredible and if the blades could lock and unlock in place it s a five star product the lid started to leak after a year called nijna customer service and even though the warranty was days past a year i got a free replacement for the lid and pitcher it took five minutes to get the replacement love the blender just be very careful the blades are super sharp makes it hard for cleaning everyone loves a ninja this was a lightning deal so i got a great price i will save it for a wedding or graduation gift because both my children and i already have one it appears to be working fine the packaging of the blender was horrible and i am astounded it wasn't stolen the ninja box was not covered by wrapping paper or placed in a another box i saw it on my porch from the street and could clearly see what it was whose stupid idea was that not cool not professional in the least great blender blends like a motha best blender for on the market had mine for years now i use mine to make frozen drinks all the time and you really can pulse icecubes into powder snow not chunky ice slush fluffy snow i would like to review this product and promote it i have used this daily and have owned it for over years great blender that is very easy to clean with only parts i absolutely love it i love this blender i make morning smoothies regularly and it crushes through ice so quickly the blade is so sharp that i did nick my finger be very careful when washing it out i would recommend it the price was the least expensive i found really great love this thing its a beast blends well and doesn't take long doing it very easy to clean love it wish there were more recipes with the booklet but that's what pinterest is for three words buy it now the best blender i've ever owned you are going to love it great product very powerful and fast great for smothies and purres my mother who lives with us needs to have her food pureed now the blender we had could not handle pureeing many of our usual food items after some research i decided to try the ninja professional blender bl now most evenings when mom smells dinner cooking she can look forward to enjoying the same freshly prepared meal we are having what a joy amazing blender blends ice frozen food easy to clean makes good smoothies have to hold the pulse button a little longer than the vitamix but for the price i gave it stars for an blender it's amazing i bought this for my daughter and she loves it and uses it all the time for blended drinks awesome a great blender just be careful when handling the blade easy cleaning the hubby likes it takes some getting use to operating this is his first blender over he likes it but he's definately not impressed he would probably give stars the handle on the top gets stuck it is easy to clean great blender i'm in smoothie heaven this works great i'm surprised at the number of bad reviews by people who got cut guess what it has a lot of blades and they are sharp maybe you should buy one of the toy blenders this is for professionals i love it works really good it makes fantastic smoothies and goes through ice cubes like butter love it i can not explain how much i love my new blender yes the blades are extremely sharp and i would advise anyone to be careful with them when washing them other than that the motor is big and powerful and crushes anything within seconds it is pretty loud so i would advise you to make smoothies or whatever it is when everyone is up so that you do not disturb them this is a very good blender for chopping and other blender needs however it did not meet my expectations for making green smoothies creamy this blender has been everything i needed it to be so worth the purchase love this blender lots of power buyer beware if you want a blender that will fit under the standard size cabinet inches above the countertop this is not for you though the specs above state this is inches tall that is nonsense i had to return this because its actual measured height is actually nearly inches no way it would fit i gave it a decent rating because one look at those six blades and the relatively simple control features made me really wish i could keep this unfortunately misinformation on this page led to me returning it which amazon makes very easy for prime members i will say i did ask amazon to change the measurements but they probably have to go through a lot of red tape with ninja before they can it blends just about anything very powerful it makes big stuff into little gooey stuff good i make smoothies when i remember to go to the grocery store and actually use the stuff i bought before it makes my kitchen smell like a zombie apocalypse i put frozen fruits some bananas avocado and pomegranate juice and it turns it all into a nice smooth well blended drink oh i love this once i learned how to use its irreplaceable great for smoothies this works extremely well on our coffee bar for those frappuccinos highly recommend love love love this make smooth smoothies using many ingredients makes a head of caulflower rice in pulses use it all the time very good blender it meets all expectations with the cutting system of several blades allows to grind up to the ice it is a robust blender the use is easy and safe it is not heavy the jar is made of plastic the lid has several opening systems that make it easy to use the price benefit ratio is excellent the packaging box is excellent the seller made the shipment on time and the product was received on time the product arrived in good condition great blender but a bit large for two people love it but wish it was smaller best blender out there super sharp blades efficient blender multi useful this is easy to assemble and clean we have gone through a lot of blenders before we found our original ninja blender it lasted for years but eventually the little plastic spout cover broke we could've bought a new lid for the old blender but for not much more we could buy a brand new machine machine came and is really nice very good blender it blends just the way i wanted to especially my morning smoothies it is very well used at this point and i love it best blender that i have ever owned great blender great price this thing is a monster love it i love this ninja vitamix who you do not need to spend all that money this is a very nice competent workhorse for your kitchen i would recommend to all my friends and i have i make smoothies daily i use it to blend soups and stews puree icing cake batter you name it the only thing i have not tried is nut butters but i have no doubt it will perform like a pro good so far kind of a pain to clean otherwise good this was given as a gift they really enjoy the product i bought nuttibullet before and it didn't work well to crush ice and after a few uses maybe less than times it stopped working i'm really satisfied with ninja it blends everything without too much turbulence it makes some sounds when the motor is on but i think it's inevitable overally happy with this purchase best blender for smoothies i use this about everyday only complaint is how i wish there was an easier way to clean the blades but thats about it obsessed must have i replaced my nutribullet with this blender and i am in love it is so solid blends perfectly and very easy clean up i like to make shakes with frozen fruit and have always had problems this blender pulverized it in a matter of seconds i am thrilled it didn't even hesitate not very loud either which is a plus works really well smooth operator best blender i've ever had it crushes ice really well and i have had no issues love it this is the best blender i have ever had i know there are probably better blenders out there but for me i call this the best blender in the world i make a breakfast smoothie with ice bananas almond milk and a chocolate powder every morning i no longer have to slice my bananas i put a frozen banana in this blender whole and with one hit of the pulse button it is blown to pieces i could be done blending a smoothie in seconds as opposed to minute with a cheap blender i ve also used this blender for cooking i had a recipe that called for an egg with ricotta cheese blended together in seconds i had a creamy pudding consistency mixture one time i was out of bread crumbs so i took stuffing and pulsed it around a few times it turned those chuncks of stuffing to dust i can t speak highly enough about this blender everyone should have one i ve had it for several months now and i am obviously still so grateful to have it in my life lol lastly to reiterate on previous reviews the blade nozzle is not attached to the blender if your pour without the lid on the blade is going to fall out and you run the risk of injury however if you follow the directions you ll be good to go i love this blender but am a little disappointed with it for blending heavier things like cashews for vegan cheese sauce so far so good it is quiet efficient easy to clean i used it once to grate coconut not that great for smoothies it is fantastic very good product the ice crushing blades make short order of the lumpiiest ice chunks i really do like this blender but despite only putting it through the dishwasher on occasion i've gone through pitcher in years because the jar warps easily i use the blender daily and love the results but wish it was made a little tougher i'm debating if i will buy another ninja the next time around or search elsewhere loooove my blender so glad i upgraded the arrangement of the blades makes handwashing the blade piece itself a little tricky gotta watch those fingers but nothing a trip through the washing machine can't fix i tried blending some ice after i took it out of the box and i had instant snow in just seconds i've used this almost daily for several months and it's still going very strong this thing is a marvel of smart design and high quality precision manufacturing they do not lie fill it with ice cubes run it and you get snow because it has blades top to bottom this baby kicks out my breakfast smoothie in less than a minute everything is good the poor spout stays open when pouring by magnets or magic i can tell but it stays up yet never opens when blending the pitcher locks onto the motor logically and effortlessly clean up is easy warm water and a drop of soap run on high for a minute and rinse done it's even really easy to clean the base sealed and wipe able all around bummed i didn't get one of these long ago very good quality so far so good love the design and power this blender puts out i'm able to easily crush ice as well as a number of different fruits vegetables i would recommend this blender to anyone only time will tell how long it lasts and i will revise review if it ever fails to soon perfect it's exactly what we wanted love it it's a beast tons of power and easy to use and clean up bought this to make whole food smoothies because my ancient model couldn't handle the load works beautifully noise level is similar to most other blenders i've used before recommend cleaning it relatively soon after using it if you let the food dry on the blades and need to scrub them your hands are at risk those blades are sharp awesome best blender i ever had love it and a great price best blender i've ever purchased i had previously purchased a cheap blender and had all sorts of problems with food not chopping up and dripping all over the place when i tried to pour my smoothies the six blades on this ensure i have a well mixed and smooth smoothie it is super easy to clean but take care when pulling out the blades they are sharp however they should be they are chopping up sometimes hard and or frozen fruit or veggies i love the pour lid it makes it so easy to pour straight into a glass without too much stuff pouring over the glass i have to say i still have a habit of placing my hand on top when blending the locking lid ensures that i don't need to do this but some habits are hard to break well done ninja i use this primarily for my morning smoothies love this blender so much power to it i absolutely love my ninja blender i use it for making smoothies salad dressings and sauces all the time i have had absolutely no issues with it at all very good blender for the money it's as powerful as more expensive ones and does a great job grinding up frozen fruits for smoothies bought this as a gift works great she loves it couldn't beat the price either saw this blender mentioned in men's health magazine it is the bomb never had such an awesome blender has pulse and low medium high speeds crushes ice like crazy smoothies come out professional we are amazed can't say enough good things about it just glad i have mine now before they sell out i like everything about the new blendet this is a pro looking blender fits nicely on the counter and i feel a lot better about spending less than on a quality blender as opposed to a vitamix my mother in law loved it blends super well and is very easy to clean highly recommend was not sure how this blender would do but have been very happy i do green smoothies daily and it chops everything up really well amazing blender love it highly recommend great blender has a lot of power to it i made so many smoothies this summer the best investment i've ever made this blender does everything it can make smoothies hummus chop oats into oat flour crush ice puree vegetables everything i've had mine for over a year now without any problems and just now bought one for my parents who also love it highly recommend best blender for the price given as a gift as an alternative to a vitamix and mother loves it this thing is awesome we ve been so happy with it for smoothies best blender ever this was a gift for my daughter she loves it still doing a pretty good job about a year later i will say you should avoid putting the main canister in the bottom rack of the dishwasher if you turn heated dry on because it partially melted the top of it this blender rocks and i got it delivered super fast buttons are smooth so easy wipe off i'm a healthcare professional and bought this after researching the competition i e vita mix after reading through a gazillion comments and reviews including cr who rates the ninja i opted for the lower priced ninja i have used mine twice a day for the weeks i have owned it i use it for making smoothies i blend for health i have a morning fruit and berry smoothie and i have an afternoon veggie smoothie blending is a really convenient way to get in all your servings of fruit and veggies each day without removing the very important fiber so far i love my ninja i have had stuff made with a vita mix in the past but have never done a side by side comparison though i can think of a few differences that are meaningful for me one the vita mix generates heat they use it as a selling feature that you can use it to make soups but i like my smoothies cold so it's not something i look for in a blender secondly vita mix seems to win in all the comparisons with ninja on smoothness or thoroughness of blending the only reason i knocked one star off the ninja is because i have noticed that my smoothies are a bit chewier after several weeks of blender use i attribute that to the fact that ninja relies apparently on their sharp blades which naturally dull with use especially when blending frozen berries or ice which both of my smoothies contain i've noticed a subtle change in texture no chunks but definitely not a fine blend my understanding is that vita mix has dull blades that work for years they do not rely so much on sharpness as they do on speed the other thing in addition to heat that you get with a vita mix is aeration foam which i do not notice with the ninja my smoothies are full of fruit and veggies so they are full of fiber if you are okay with having some noticeable fiber in your blend over time the ninja is a great deal at about the cost if that matters to you expect that you will have it in time i started to notice it after about blends the blender cleans very easily and is simple to use i've never had to remove the top to tamp stuff down and i use cups of leafy greens like kale and arugula as well as whole carrots celery apples and never have chunks overall it's a great machine i cannot rate longevity since i've only had it weeks but so far i'm very pleased update it's january i owned the ninja about months and ended up getting a vita mix i still stand by my original review but there is a difference the ninja starts out pretty great but then over time things do no blend as well i drink smoothies a day one veggie one fruit so i use it a minimum of x a day over time i started calling my ninja smoothies grainies the blades start out very sharp and the technology depends on that but they dull with use and it shows in the results the vita mix does not depend on blade sharpness but power it pummels everything to pieces itty bitty pieces i am amazed at the flour i can make with it also the heat i mentioned is not a factor but a feature most things are blended in less than a minute seconds often so nothing really gets warm unless you leave it on in order to generate heat the ninja is a good blender especially for the cost but i don't think one can fairly compare it to a vita mix it's like comparing apples and oranges with three blades this blender can do the job it's easy to clean in the dishwasher and it really did turn ice into snow in only a few seconds i've never been more impressed with a blender this has been a good blender so far has performed well for every task that we have used it for months in and we use this blender almost everyday we use it for milkshakes and smoothies and to make cashew cheese it never disappoints bought this for my mother and she loves it she uses it almost daily this was a very good price and we made this was a very good price and we made wonderful smoothies with it amazing blender lives up to reputation and then some i ll update after a bit of use but right off the bat i m very impressed with this blender first of all it came days sooner than expected very happy bout dis second it s easy as hell to use and clean and does a great job for smoothies the one reason i bought it highly recommend this was a christmas gift for my nephew he uses it every day as far as i know he has had no problems i received this blender as a gift for christmas i love it i blend protein shakes five at a time so the ounce container is perfect the blender fits under my cupboard so i don't lose any of my counterspace i also love the built in safety features of a locking lid and container it is not a loud blender at all it is very good at destroying the super frozen items i blend weekly this blender is plain out amazing i am so glad i received it p s using the blender properly is not difficult there is a reason why it has locking features if you don't know read the instructions strong and stable my cuisinart of years finally burnt out so time to give this ninja a try has not disappointed yet through smooths and cooking so far it s been a couple of months and i ve definitely loved it if a demon emerges from the depth of this machine i will update my review love this love it very strong the blades make it a step above this thing is a monster so far works great blends ice and frozen fruit easily and the blades are still sharp after a couple years of occasional use if they love it i love it love this works great for smoothies and veggie drinks so far all we've made is smoothies in it works well for crushing up the ice the blades are super sharp and a little awkward to handle because there are several on it be careful when handling i already managed to cut my finger on it best blender ever this also doubles as an excellent salsa maker all hail the ninja christmas gift excited to put it to use i bought this for my wife and she loves it can chop through frozen things no problem thanks i am very happy with my item thanks for fast shipment don t listen to the negative reviews that s what almost convinced me not to get this blender but i m so happy i chose to still buy it because i trusted the ninja brand it didn t disappoint me and it won t disappoint you i bought this specifically just to make my protein shakes and a smoothie here and there however it comes with a small booklet of various types of creations you can make with the blender anyways it s very easy to use clean and damn all my shakes taste x better than before get it you ll thank yourself later this was a wedding gift for my niece she and her husband were using it the day after the wedding and loved it so much power blends pretty well ok good amazingly well constructed thanks ninja for making the lid closure more sturdy i use this to chop ice for frozen drinks and it works great the best love it works for everything i love this blender it came quick and everything was nice and packaged it works really great and great for smoothies used on only one occasion so far seems excellent large capacity fast better design due to blades extending all the way from bottom to top instead of just at bottom very even blending immediately instead of just on bottom tough construction easy to use safe this thing is freaking sweet it cuts chops and blends like a freaking pro my favourite is to make cashew cheese my boyfriend melted the bottom on my toaster oven but kind of fixed it and it still works great product totally works me up and gets me wet love it the blender works amazing my only beef with this package is when it was delivered to my house the outside of the box said exactly what was on the inside so much for a secret for christmas i live with my parents and i got this for my mother she was the one to grab the package so be prepared that if you decide to get this as a present for someone who lives with you don t let them get the package best blender very sleek looking as well this is fantastic and by far the best blender we've ever had no problem with crushing ice we love this blender for making smoothies best blender i've had a few blenders over the years there was a krups that was a wedding present and lasted about years followed by a much nicer breville that lasted maybe years total it was the cheaper of the two similar models but out of the box i could tell that the motor was under powered especially at it's higher settings it smelled smoky even new and eventually it burned out so for it's replacement i landed here didn't want to spend several hundred dollars but went for wattage hp this time and it shows confidence inspiring and i'm sure will handle whatever i throw at it i make smoothies almost every day with frozen fruit and it handles with ease the blades are crazy sharp and stack up through the pitcher and seem to pull the contents down so everything gets crushed blended the pitcher locks to the base and the lid locks down on the pitcher and the motor won't run unless both are locked into place i think this is a safety feature because it could easily mince up a hand full of fingers if you got them in there the blade stack lifts out which makes cleaning easy after about a month of moderate heavy use i'm impressed and happy this is a very good blender first off i'm giving this blender a star review even though i'm saying be careful this is why when i first used it i was amazed how powerful and fantastic this blender was i was making ceasar salad dressing for a family dinner it made quick work of a usually long process which is exactly why i bought it however with other blenders i usually take the lid off and pour my substance out of the container when i did this the huge blade fell out and cut my finger very badly leaving blood in my dressing i too was traumatized like others had said but i was so impressed with the results i went back and figured out what i did wrong the main problem was i needed to remove the blade from the container as it is not affixed to it it is just sitting there once i was aware of that everything was fine and i love it now only thing is the directions should have large lettering or warnings about this and they do not so beware simply awesome easy to use and very easy to clean afterward so that's a big deal around our house we ran through things in this blender that literally made our old one smoke and smell like it was on fire i'm really happy with the machine so now we'll see if it stands the test of time for sharpness of blades and length of service this thing is a dynamo awesome not sure if its what i blended but the plastic broke on mine after a few uses i love this blender i ve gone through so many cheap blenders that have only lasted a few months and this one has lasted more than that so far granted it s pretty loud but i love how you can take it apart to clean it easily i got this blender because it is recommended by consumer reports i am very pleased with it i use it every day to make protein shakes it cuts through ice very easily i also like that it is dishwasher safe i put the cup in the bottom rack and i put the lid and blade in the top rack of our dishwasher bought this for my wife s birthday believe it or not she loves it awesome power simple controls and eeasy to clean best mixed drinks ever it works amazing noisey but does the job larger footprint than i expected exactly what i needed fast consistent results and is well built even though a lot of plastic highly recommend great for smoothies great product at good price very easy to operate with all the safety features built in to make delicious smoothie juices pureed food for my year old dad for every meal perfect every time arrived in perfect condition i use this to make my own laundry soap good overall use sturdy machine my only complaint is that it doesn t render a perfectly smooth result great product blades are heavy duty i make fruit shakes or protein shakes almost every day with ice so far so good it s noisey but that s to be expected and it s not the noisiest i ve heard my shakes come out splendid and all who drink love them wonderful multipurpose tool love love love this device this is the next level when it comes to blenders perfection and for the price this is a steal high quality i am somebody who likes to research quality before purchasing an item this blender is constructed very well and has a triple layer blade and processes food very well that the price also purchased the splendor you cannot go wrong go right past vita mix and expensive kitchen aid and go for this one it is better than the magic bullet purchased as a gift but i have a ninja and love it wow it was good keep the kids away as this will chop up and blend anything only thing i don't like is the height keeps it from sliding under the counter cabinets unless you take the top off otherwise a does everything i ask it to quite pleased with the horsepower behind it scratching my head why anyone would ever pay x as much for a vitamixer now it does a great job no complaints there the lid cover is a bit strange it traps water so take it out teh dish washer and next thing you notice its dripping water all over minor issue but irritating blends my smoothies very well blades are razor sharp love it been surprisingly happy with performance will have to see how it lasts over time good design easy to use and clean very good high speed blender for the price however maybe i'm not use to the noise but i found it to be extremely loud like really loud oh well i guess i'll get use to it in any case it's great for smoothies soups and dips this blender works at watts it only takes a few seconds to blend practically anything this blender works perfectly for my needs the blades are a little sharp and can be tough to handle when hand washing so be careful it works really well i just wish it didnt have to be locked into place in order for it to begin blending but it is safer that way this blender is like a weapon the way the blade runs down the center pretty intense but good love it i only use this for smoothies however so i can t give an honest review for general use other than that though i love it this blender is amazing it blows the doors off my oster blender that is losing steam from old age yrs it is louder but it blends in of the time that the oster required i also have a hand blender from bruan that this ninja outperforms the speed and the six blades make all the difference additionally it received solid reviews from cr my brother stands by his vitamix i will take the ninja for everyday best blender ever power love the blades extremely sharp cut myself a few times cleaning them this was a gift and has been used a lot they were very happy with it i love my ninja and absolutely cannot say enough about it first off the power of it is amazing compared to all the other blenders i've used such as oyester black and decker and a couple others it's power is far stronger than all the others i've used but what's more amazing about it is that it's so much quieter than the others it's a win win situation for sure this blender is also a food processor so the range of things that can be done with it is limitless i enjoy juicing fruits and vegetables but don't like typical juicers because it throws away all the pulp and that is where the vast majority of nutrients are with the ninja i get the best quality of fresh juices smoothies and protein drinks i also really enjoy making my baby's food and with the ninja it truly makes it a breeze only the best for my little one i have also made soup with it by blending my steamed veggies and then heated on the stove the cleanup is so much easier than any other blender i've used as well i have been using my ninja for already months and it works like a charm this product is something i would recommend to anyone we use this mixer for smoothies love it this beats any standard blender just be sure to clean up right after your done and it's very easy to keep clean the super sharp blades slice frozen fruit ice bolts just kidding but in any case the blender is awesome this is our second one we used to own an older model and the only reason we needed a new one was the old one fell off the counter and broke the container manufactured solid and with good quality parts best blender ever i love it powerful and easy to use best blender we've owned not easy to clean though this was a replacement my other one fell off the counter somehow and i like this one even better it seems to make my smoothies thicker love my ninja fast and effective this will pulverize just about anything you put into it i had a regular type of blender before this and made smoothies i used to use a strainer to strain some of the pulp out and the strainer would catch a good amount of pulp i tried doing that with this blender and there is barely any big chunks of pulp left i also use this to make almond milk and it does a great job margaritas are also no problem as well as crushing ice this thing is a beast it's perfect even crushed hard ice its a blender and works like a blender amazing ' ' who knew a product specially made for blending actually blends things i blend frozen strawberries and blueberries and other things just for fun works well blends well hard to pour liquids into it though due to the height of the blade this blender is a beast and i love it i am not sure why others complained about the design it's extremely well made we've had this blender for about years it's held up well blends everything we put into it ice frozen fruit and vegetables still looks good and has a really large capacity most smoothie prep is quick and consistent least glass pitcher would be more reliable based on previous ninja purchase made really well and does a great job with my smoothis blends perfectly i've owned this product for about six weeks and i've used it pretty regularly no complaints no food getting stuck at the bottom of the blender cleans up pretty easy and no i haven't cut myself with the extremely sharp blades because umm well i know they're sharp i would definitely recommend this blender for others looking for a great blender at a great price works great excellent price logistics is great in my home is necessary it is worth the money they seem to be higher than the original quality very kind and best selling it works great and it s big enough to fit all my fruits and vegetables for my smoothie perfect smoothies chops even ice cubes get big glasses out of it works great where have you been all my life sharkninja i didn't realize that i never owned a good blender in my entire life until i bought this one this blender makes short work of ice cubes and blends my protein shakes to perfection my sister made margaritas with it and was blown away by how easily and smoothly it mixed and blended people always ask if i'm using a vitamix and they're surprised when i say no and tell them how much i paid for this gem it's so easy to use and clean if you're intimidated by washing the sharp blades buy a good bottle brush with a handle it cleans the blades perfectly this blender is amazing and very powerful i haven't owned a blender for many years although i have every other kind of kitchen appliance known to man i decided that i might need one occasionally so purchased this one now a few months later i find i use it all the time it works beautifully cleans up easily and is well built and sturdy it is incredibly strong and stable and will handle anything i throw at it or i should say in it purchase with confidence after years of using and burning out cheap blenders i finally decided to upgrade to this quality blender and i am so so glad i did this has a very sturdy base which does not shift while blending the carafe locks into place with ease and does not shift at all while blending either the lid also locks into place and does not move while blending or pouring so there is no need to hold the top of the blender while it is going the carafe holds a ton of stuff as well so fewer batches are needed when pureeing large recipes such as soup the blades are super sharp and slide into place quickly and easily they are not mounted to the bottom similar to a food processor blade so it is easiest to keep the lid on and pour through the pour hole on the corner and then remove the lid and blade unit for washing afterwards contrary to other reviews it does not pop out for no reason it does however fall out if you hold the unit upside down with the lid off due to gravity this is incredibly powerful as well i very rarely need to process anything for more than seconds no matter what it is i puree soups and make smoothies and milkshakes all in under thirty seconds of blending ice simply gets eaten up and there are no large chunks as i've found with other brands and models i also use this to puree food scraps for my worm composting unit and it fully purees a full carafe of eggplant peels pepper insides and celery ends along with some water into a v consistency in thirty seconds overall this is one of the best additions to my kitchen this year and worth every single penny i highly highly recommend it great and powerful blender the best one i've ever owned i cannot wait to try margharita's in it perfect blending every time very easy to use don't expect super smooth jamba juice texture but for the price this is excellent really like the opening flap built into a corner of the lid to pour out flap snaps in place while opened so the opening lid does not fall down while pouring love this blender it does a fantastic job of blending i've made smoothies soup and even snow cones using this blender and they all came out awesome the key is to let it blend for a little longer than you think the ads make it seem like it gets the job done in a few seconds but on average it takes about to seconds to fully blend something great blender for all of our needs makes smoothies and sauces in a snap be careful with those blades while cleaning they are sharp whoa so strong watch out for the blades take these scary looking blades out first then pour out your contents if you only put in fruits without any liquid its not a slushly icee level but i mean it is pretty darn close i love the pulse because it helps all your food just meddle into one big mush crushes ice like a monster the best makes the greatest smoothies ever very professional blender best blender for frozen protein shakes with frozen fruits love this blender cleans easily i've only used it for my protein powder drink with frozen strawberries and it does the job in seconds i did use ice in it once just to see how it worked and it did the job quickly it is exactly what i wanted it does my shakes and smoothies well i love amazon carries these type of products this is a powerhouse it does ado much more love love it very pleased with my ninja blender and it's performance just tried the ninja for the first time amazing my old blender a machine was a real dog compared to this one the ninja can handle large chunks of frozen fruit with ease compared to my old blender where i had to put one strawberry at a time it just blasts right through and purees in seconds considering that this model wasn't much more expensive than my old blender it's a wonderful value watch the video on how to clean your blender so that you don't have to come in contact with the blades they are sharp as razors but if you use the soapy water method immediately you shouldn't have to touch them this blender has some nice safety features but you need to be aware so that you don't get cut as others have mentioned in their reviews i love this blender i haven't been let down one bit yet great purchase love it very strong easy to use love this blender and it was affordable i use it often love it just what i needed i originally bought aimores pro blender because of great reviews but returned it since it was huge and had some functions that i would never use then i decided to try ninja instead and so far i like it the size is normal easy to use and the function is not overwhelming however the blade is dangerously sharp call me stupid but i washed it with a sponge in my hand before the first use and i got five cuts on my hands including one deep cut all within seconds the sponge looked brutally abused too the manual says to use a brush yes i know i should have known but i am so traumatized that it scares me every time i wash it i could wash it in the dishwasher but i use it frequently to make smoothie food and baby food love it she loves it thank you this is a great powerful blender but warning the blades are insanely dangerous to clean if you don't have a dishwasher you will slice open your fingers trying to clean it it's amazing works perfect would definitely buy again best blender i've ever had this blender actually pulverizes chile seeds which was important for me since i make hot sauce instead of having to scoop out all the seeds and lose that delicious heat i can now blend them right into my product and you would never know they were in there i'm very happy i also made pie dough using the pulse button and it worked very well to keep small chunks of butter intact this is an amazing machine it makes great food and cleans up real easy smoothies are great and helps in making delicious soups and hummus i had another ninja product for a bit and am glad i upgraded to this one awesome performance for those who want to do some serious blending the three blades readily turn stuff into a smooth puree has a small but handy feed slot on the top seems pretty rugged but time will tell this is the best blender we ever had my wife didn't break it yet i love it i use mine for smoothies in the morning and also some baking purposes like crushing cookies for dirt pudding impressed by the high quality i did not think anything would be able to measure up to my vitamix but this blender comes pretty close a pleasure to use bad ass blender great blender durable this is my third ninja and i'll keep buying them until their quality dips now you may ask why i like them so much since i've had three of them you may be thinking they keep failing me but you'd be wrong they're actually tough as nails my family just uses them so much that they get all 'gunked up' and a bit unsightly to look at the end result is that i buy one about every to years but all three are still working we use the older ones for things outside the house such as friend's parties anyway the buttons on this one are very easy you really don't even need a user manual to get started but you do need to know how to afix the blending element into the motor base correctly this is a top notch blender and blends everything you can throw at it like every other blender on the market it's pretty loud at higher settings but that's because it's doing its job it eats up ice in no time and blends fruit and vegetables with ease the handy reclosable spout on top of the container is great because you can store it in the fridge as is until you've used all the product in the container then you just wash it back up and put it back into service ninjas are relatively expensive but they are well worth the extra money in my view get it and you won't regret it works good use it every day perfect thanks by far the best blender ever i had a normal blender with the tiny little blade at the bottom and had to use a spoon to push the food down to get blended and it still didn't blend thoroughly not any more this blender has blades all the way up the shaft so in half or less of the time it was taking i have a perfect smoothie that is completely blended love my ninja blender the spout on the lid is awesome for it helps with no spilling overflow over the edges mixes great this beast is loud as hell but it does its job beautifully i can't use it past pm because i feel like i'm assaulting my neighbors try this cup of nutella cup of peanut butter cup of whole milk cups of vanilla ice cream it tastes exactly like a reese's peanut butter cup shake you get at friendly's you can also add a dollop of cool whip and a little splash of vanilla extract to really elevate your shakes i just love power in an appliance this blender is very efficient not so noisy as i expected and easy to operate and clean i also like very much the huge capacity it has i really like it my old blender did not have the power that this one has the blades are relly sharp be careful i bought it as a christmas gift for my daughter in law and i know she will love it powerful and economic great for making juices uses quite a bit of power but not enough to trip circuit breaker good to use daily there s usually no problem with making sure everything it s blend it the only issue is that you have to leave it on high for extra long to get a more smooth smoothie this one left me happy though i did not have the extra money to buy a vitamix best blender ive ever owned great machine by far the best we have ever had love it the ninja is perfect for green smoothies and was a great value for less than a hundred bucks i ve had my ninja for nearly four years and it s still going strong my average use is about times week it still blends great i ve never had the plastic break i ve never been cut by the blades handle it with care and you ll definitely get your money s worth out of this investment it is everything i expected and more i really does turn ice into snow for example i crushed ice for a smoothie and it turned into sherbet i do suggest starting on low and then going to med and then high when crushing ice or anything with chunks i started on high and it left some dime chunks of ice but when i start on low it seems to get them all and crush them would definitely recommend this product love it not as powerful as i had hoped but it works fine much better than a regular blender that's for sure great product for the money solid construction and good power easy to use love it so excited making smoothies satisfied order as a gift and recipient very happy ordered another for myself and we use almost daily extremely happy will order again if i need to send a gift wow this thing is a beast i don't know how you could make a blender better it's perfect for my protein shakes that i use with frozen fruit that i had to defrost for my old blender that i store in the fridge for a few days no need to defrost my frozen fruit anymore this thing make it perfect without the need for that works great harder to clean because of the blades love it blends fruit nicely and also makes a great slushie best blender we've ever owned used so powerful and quick works well and is less expensive than the vitamix love just about everything this blender does no problems love the power very good fantastic omg i love this it makes my smoothies creamy and smooth blends very very well this is a fantastic machine for the money makes perfect smoothies every time very easy to use easy to clean very well made this is a great blender it is to replace my old one i love them there was a line in the bottom of the blender that i thought was a crack so on the replacement blender it has the same thing so i believer its a line in the mold for the plastic blender all is good and the customer service i received was excellent cant beat amazon for service works flawlessly totally more intense powerful machine then my oster really fast great clever safety features to prevent injury from large blade much better machine than expected unfortunately it did not create a fine creamy shake the shakes were coarse in texture with chips and pieces no longer how long it ran my oster took longer but produces a much much finer creamier result works great as soon as i got it i filled it to the top with ice cubes and turned it on it made snow not chunky ice but actually packable snow i made three snowballs and threw them at my kids in the house in the middle of the summer so it totally works pretty quiet too for all that muscle love it works like a champ light but well made plastic pitcher easy to maneuver in the sink to easily clean great price very pleased love this blender easily crushed ice and frozen fruits a little noisy but it's very efficient and fast so not a big deal pretty easy to clean this blender is fantastic extremely powerful at a very reasonable price this thing is great super fast and powerful plus it looks good too i like that it's easier to clean and not a lot of pieces to pull out and clean i love the corner pour option as well so you don't have to undo the top and have the blades fall out i'm impressed with this blender especially for the price there were definitely more expensive ones out there glad i went with this i love it don't be put off by the plastic jug it is solidly made and works a charm the blades come out easily and cleanup is much easier than my bottom bladed glass blender great value really good blender easy to use and clean would recommend for anyone that once a highly efficient powerful blender sounds like a 'chain saw' but makes primo smoothies at a fraction of the cost of a vita mix excellent great purchase easy to wash and crushes everything like no other so far it seems to be working fine for our smoothies i haven't tried to use it for anything else be careful cleaning it it is easy to cut yourself first ninja product wow lives up to the hype not disappointed this blender has been heavily used for the past months and still works great easy to clean and blends well the pouring flap on top sometimes flies up so be prepared to hold it down i highly recommend this product it is a staple in our kitchen excellent performance bought this as a present for my mother and she loves it great value smoothies are on lock down first kitchen tool i have brought my wife that she uses everyday this will conquer you i love this blender the cup capacity is far more practical than the lesser cup blender distant cousins it will be perfect for margarita time three blades to blend whatever the hell you shove down in there the lid locks into place as does the pitcher no more blender mishaps with the ill fitting flimsy lids a solid blender that makes a fine addition to all the kitchen gadgets that one needs for a good time so far great buy by far this has been my favorite blender very easy to use very simple looks great and overall operates better than any other blender i've had so far i'm happy with this one i've been putting this blender through its paces with a chutney recipe that requires blending fresh ginger which my previous blender failed at miserably wow is this ninja ever a star it also has several layers of very sharp blades which cuts down on time one of the best features is that if you don't have it securely put together it won't run it's easy to use easy to clean blades and container are dishwasher friendly and the lid usually only requires a soapy water rinse and works like well a ninja you will not go wrong with this blender it is cool i don't think it works quite as well as they show in commercials cleaning the blender to end all blenders i drink a lot of frozen fruit smoothies in order to get enough fruit in my diet this one as all the other reviews state is a breeze to clean just carefully without touching any of the blades lift the center spindle blade attachment from the center of the pitcher and rinse the pitcher out to clean two pieces the blade and the pitcher operation press power button after plugging in hit one of three speeds or pulse basic and gets it done no confusion the lid has a secure release handle that has a button which must be depressed in order to remove or lift the lid from the pitcher otherwise it's secure solid rubber gasket seals it tight and there's a pour spout that has a closable lid everything locks up securely and easily instruction manual not even needed loudness the quietest blender ive ever owned compared to basic black decker and oster models under those sounded like chainsaws i was sure it would be even louder than those given the power of the blender but no it is as loud as those typical blenders living a better life with this product high quality and great value use daily and going strong such a powerful blender the best i have ever had comes apart easily and everything goes right in the dishwasher works great i don't know how i've been opening my wine all these years this thing is amazing effortlessly opens bottles without a corky mess if you're a frequent wine drinker you have to have this took us a little while to figure out the controls on it but once you figure it out you're good works wonderful my wife loves it so much easier for me to open my wine bottles we love this opener it is so easy to use and the price is so reasonable do yourself a favor and purchase this it s one of our go to gifts for fellow wine lovers my old one finally broke after about years of accelerated and very consistent use i am buying another one because i loved it so much i don't need the neon pretty models that do all sorts of extra stuff i just want my darned wine opened and pronto i am happy to report this opener is even easy for the wine opener operator to use after consuming many many bottles of wine in one evening just put it on the bottle and push the button and the cork is removed then if you have any left over energy and motivation you push the button in the opposite direction and the cork pops out of the opener one night it was even tried it on a can of beer however it does not work as effectively on beer cans it wasn't me that tried opening a can of beer with this wine opener i am writing this review for a friend wink thank goodness for amazon prime and day shipping easy to use and works as described don't like that i have to leave it plugged into an electrical socket rather than just charging occasionally but opener is efficient and easy to use charge lasts a while i charge it then unplug and leave on counter i have to give it a good twist before it starts to enter cork but once its in the cork comes out of bottle and reverses out of opener very easily love this wine opener sure makes life a lot easier for my wife she has ra and can not open a cored wine bottle this is her favorite birthday gift love it easy to use love it just could not figure out how to remove the paper love this item we have two of them works real well it works great i wished the instructions were better press the down button until it stops and press the up button until the cork is released if you drink wine you should have this opener this has a classy look and works perfectly i even gave them as gifts really like this opener had a different product that would not hold a charge this works great easy to use an elegant it s fantastic best wine opener i ve ever had can t say enough good things

and has lasted forever what more could i want works even better than expected will recommend to everyone works awesome love this i absolutely despise opening cork wine bottles so this product makes it hassle free theres also a wine bottle cutter that comes with it to remove the foil covering easily time saver and so easy to use tool to last a long long time we have had one of these for over years we bought a new one because the old ones battery started to not keep up after about years you will love this if you drink wine perfect for people with hand issues very good device great product just what i was looking for great product great price works great no foil cutter included i had another brand that just wouldn't open the tight corks without a struggle this ones operates perfect uncorks smooth it works properly but the batery doesn`t last too much i love this opener having arthritis in my hands this makes opening the bottle containing my favorite beverage a breeze i ordered this over years ago now and its still working great yea a cork gets stuck every now and then but it still took a cork out of every bottle love this product this is my favorite toy i drink a lot of wine and now it's a conversation piece whenever i open a bottle with friends also easier on the wrists now that i don't have to twist and pull anymore it s a solid wine opener and i ve had a lot of use out of it i ve never owned one before and have nothing to compare it to but this makes opening wine so much easier the manual ones can be frustrating i ve broken several of them by either bending the handles or the corksrew getting messed up my favorite opener to use after a long day the battery holds a charge well for months i had to buy a new one when my last one fell from a high shelf and broke i had the previous opener for years this makes a fabulous christmas present it's a little loud comfortable and works well i don't know how i got along with out it this works perfect love it this is our second

as a gift my wine enthusiast friend loved it i can't speak to the long term quality because i gave it away but haven't heard any complaints great price holds it's charge for a long time wife loves it love it sure makes opening the wine bottle easy bought this years ago still works like new so much easier to get the bottle of wine open and to get the cork out of the opener works great i bought this product over yrs ago it is just now on it's last leg it is still running i keep charged up but the strength of the turning screw is so slow low it doesn't completely work trust e when i say i used this product frequently i just ordered this exact one as a replacement you can't get a better product works perfectly and was delivered when promised holds a charge for a month or more very handy and would make a great gift for friends i bought two of these for christmas gifts one for my mom and one for my daughter they both report that they use these all the time and think they are fabulous now i've ordered one for my sister for her birthday great product works great and the charge has lasted weeks good price with some corks the extraction is dificult work great this was a treat for our family we got tired of breaking our expensive handheld wine bottle openers i can't believe that it was so affordable this is a great idea for those wine lovers as a gift it was a gift i assume it's working great good replaced one that lasted years this is a great wine opener yes there is a bit of a learning curve but once you figure out you hold the bottle still and let the gadget do the work opening the wine is nearly effortless a super purchase love these i bought one and liked it so much that i bought couple as christmas gifts great job neat tool wifie can open it works as designed no issues going strong after months and bottle of wine a day i like not having to change batteries does the job if you drink wine and we do you must have this so easy and nice quality looks fine sitting on our bar too works as advertised easily opens a bottle owwf wine especially valuable for people with arthritis in the hands i own this and it worked so well i bought one for my boyfriend and he loves his i ve had mine for several years and never had a problem with it this unit works great have used in to open bottles so far and no problems love that its rechargeable saves me the cost of batteries item shipped and received as promised excellent product so good looking and easy to manage specially when you don't know or are too weak to use the regular wine bottle openers also the price is great used it for over a year now it still works wonderful no parts has broken highly recommend it for the wine lovers it is ok but it is difficult to hold the bottle and the opener at the same time the bottle spins i was using the old fashioned rabbit opener til a friend told me about this wow what a difference i just love how fast and easy it is to work have had this for years and works great it seems to hold a charge for months my only complaint is that the plastic surface has become sticky tacky and nothing seems to remove it even tried using armorall to no avail not a big deal but an annoyance the best wine bottle opener and price is right have opened more than bottles without recharging works great the wife loves them happy wife well you know the rest i have had this product for a while and use it all the time very durable and the only rub is that sometimes that cork does not eject and it has to be held while operating to get it out good product for the money i reordered for a gift somehow when opening bottles i always manage to mess up i've watched youtube videos wikihow you name it i always manage to pulverize the cork inside the bottle break it or even chip a bit of the glass of with the normal openers it made me not want to drink wine from the bottles sad i know this somehow managed to solve my problem it has worked every time i have used it and shows no sign of giving up yet helpful i love this device so easy to use whenever my friends come over they end up buying one bought it as a christmas gift for my best friend for her personal use and our wine nights literally so happy with it will be buying one for myself this is the best wine opener ever one of the easiest ways to open a bottle love this product extremely user friendly and efficient when i learned how to get the screw dead center the cork comes right out if not then it needs help with a knife overall i love it i can actually open a bottle of wine without my husbands help now works quickly and easily works great good price nothing more to say bought as a gift they love it easy pizzy the first one broke on me on the second use but they promptly send me a new one i've had it for a while and it's still working great this thing is a godsend works wonderfully the instructions were not clear at least to me so it took a little time to figure this out once i did this tool is a must have for any wine drinker just pop it over the top of the cork and hold the down button until the cork is completely removed that simple i can't believe how long it took me to get this in my life i have one of these and love it so much that i ordered one for my dad perfect size doesn t take up too much counter top space easy to use and works great i will be ordering more as gifts in the future i purchased this for my fiancee and she loves it i love it because i never have to open another bottle of wine for her yay we love it very easy to use and does not break the cork this was a replacement for one we had for many years it works great works great and stays charged wife loves it works great great gift item tt got this for my mom who loves wine but arthritis in her hands makes using a normal corkscrew difficult she really likes it and uses it all the time it took her several tries to get the hang of using it but now she's all set she also really likes the foil cutter that came with it stars for product awesomeness minus one for learning curve might buy one for myself now too useit every time we have wine and it made our lives much easier stays charged and have had no problems at a just easy wine drinking this is our second wine opener the first one simply died battery and you can't replace the battery or i couldn't find a source these things are great excellent wine cork remover nice did not use it yet bought this for my sister who is a wine lover as am i would definitely recommend took me an embarrassing amount of time to get the hang of this thing but once i did i love it we've had it almost a year and haven't had to charge it yet despite our above average wine consumption this has been great works great so easy to use love the foil cutter being handy and stored to be ready to use had another for years and when it broke we had to immediately order another works great lasts a long time holds a charge for long amounts of time great value for the price if you drink wine this is a no brainer love it the easiest and effortless way to open and enjoy a bottle of wine love it would buy it again as a matter of fact i already did for a christmas present last year works great great price and great product it's very light and works perfectly many reviews warned about not letting the opener die as the corkscrew could become stuck in the device with no way to recharge we've heeded this warning and charge it overnight about once a week just to be safe using the opener is insanely easy quick and fun hold the down button while securing the wine bottle until you feel the cork pop free move device away from the bottle and push the up button to back the cork off the screw done works perfect i opened bottles on a full charge maybe my most used kitchen appliance haha great and easy to use bought it for my wife she loves it given as a gift to my sister who has terrible arthritis in her hands this allows her to open a wine bottle with ease fast delivery ease of opeeration effortless the opener works as it should i got it to replace an old non rechargeable model that finally gave up the ghost the opener works as it should and seems to have enough power the only two issues i have with it are the stand has just a red led that lights while it is charging and stays red no indication that it is fully charged inconvenient the opener has no window so you can see it work i didn't think this would bother me but since my old one was clear i guess it does otherwise i would have given this unit the fifth star hopefully i'll be irritated by the two little issues for a long time this unit has good power even opens synthetic corks with ease father in law loves it i can open my wine faster then i ever did before works great love it bought additional one for the neighbor as a christmas gift perfect and super easy to use very nice wine opener have used it several times works great work well works well right out of the box it's a bit noisy like a cordless drill which it basically is so you definitely aren't going to sneak a bottle of wine open with this i bought this item while on sale during black friday bought one as a gift and one for me so far so good very easy to use no more straining to open up bottles hope this last for a while product as described easy to use convenient wine bottle opener we have had ours for a year and just bought this one for a christmas gift highly recommend i bought this as s house warming gift to myself this actually makes about the th one in our family as every one has one of these it will not disappoint you at all we haven't had one die yet it is very handy and takes up very little counter room works like a charm with no effort required cork is deposited into your hand when you put it in reverse if you have arthritic fingers with a loss of power and strength you will find this product a blessing received this as a housewarming gift a few years ago and as a wine drinking it is wonderful let my mom borrow it for thanksgiving dinner for people and it never made it home now my mom and i both have quick and easy access to our wine love it aaaa this wine opener makes opening wine bottles effortless i have arthritis and it is sometimes painful to use a regular cork screw this works so well i don't mind being the one to open the wine at all so far so good i m enjoying this wine opener works great this is easy to use and works great just what we needed i was surprised at how well this worked i m obsessed it is a little light weight so i was skeptical when i first got it but it s so much easier than any other wine opener i ve used got this for a friend and they love it they ve bought several for gifts so easy to use and the design is sleek enough to be able to keep out on your counter birthday gift daughter in law loved it is hard to open bottle with a harder cork but still works great on the other corks best opener ever i purchased multiple of these for christmas gifts worked very good it is a bit large however cut that pain in the backside foil seal that the wine bottlers use with ease i could get more use out of it if my wife let me drink more not happening however everyone fought for this at the holiday gift exchange works very good makes it easier then using cork screw this is my go to bottle opener it is very easy to use and portable enough to put away if not wanting to keep it on the counter amazing was reluctant to buy since i'm more into the traditional wine openers but this is so easy to use the only downside is the noise but that's just me being picky it really is a great product especially for the price no more painful nights where you just need some wine but the only wine opener you have is a ineffective one that basically just requires brute force with this new electric wine opener opening wine has become an entertainment and part of the enjoyment of drinking wine zero force needed just an easy step process of pushing the button down and then up super easy to use even my grandma can use it it s designed so well that no user manual is needed i also love the seal cutter that allows me to beautifully remove the seal love that it fits right into the back of the stand the only reason why i docked star is because it took several tries of pressing the button up and down to get the cork out for me it s not a big deal though and it s definitely the best wine opener i ve used so far no good it only lasted after less than a year my father absolutely loved it great gift works pretty well i was wary of buying a contraption such as this but i stand corrected very easy to use and takes the cork out with ease makes it much easier for me to open bottles i simply don't have the strength to pull a cork out of a bottle i got this for my mom for xmas and we both loved it it is so easy and convenient to use she got me one for my birthday last week i love it it's a must have for any wine lovers especially if you have carpal tunnel arthritis or your just tired of fussing with bottle openers great product it actually works got this after a ridiculous hour spent trying to open the bubbly on christmas morning a very good deal and work properly i like very much a little frustrated at first but that was only because i hadn't read the directions hold the button down until stops and the cork is out this was a replacement and works great i love the wine opener i had bought of them and gave the other two to friends they are also pleased about using them were all wine drinkers my husband loves this gadget and uses it all the time this is the second one we ve had i think we wore the other one out i believe this is my wife's favorite appliance in the kitchen she's broken every wine opener has ever had usually within a couple of bottles not this one this was the perfect gift for her and gets regular use in our house it sitst a little tall so finding the right place might be a little challenging it hold a charge well and is quick easy to use love it purchased as a gift for my mother product works great as advertised this is one of the best electronic devices i own it opens bottles of wine and everyone thinks it s magic why the red light when charging it does not look good as other products with the same purpose but well i'll wait until this one wears off i gave it to a wonderful friend for christmas and she hasn't complained about it so it must be really good i broke my last one so this is a replacement easy to recommend as long as you don't drop it on tile floor and crack the unit like i did works great works well and looks good too love this wine opener bit large but great for the cost runs out of battery fairly quickly great for opening wine easy peasy given as a gift as a replacement for identical item the recipient says it works well and he couldn't live without it it is streamlined and takes up little room on the counter these last a couple of years and work really well works great very happy with it love it love it works great my second one the first was old and weak works well and compact we had this wine opener for about years and then it died so we purchased another one and would recommend it stayed at a friend's place and he had a different manufacturer but i loved the idea my hubby has arthritis in his hands this opener is easy to use and quiet love the weight and the foot print great purchase absolutely the best product for the money i bought this for my son and he loves it and works very well and it was a very good price i love it plug ti the wall excellent opener we have had this for over years now and use it every day occasionally a cork will crumble but it is a rare occurrence we had a problem for a couple of weeks where we thought it was dying but found a small piece of split cork trapped inside once removed it was as good as new i used this opener times and it was absolutly amazing it took only seconds between grabbing the bottle and drinking the bottle but on the th use my world changed suddenly the button to remove the cork stopped working and i had to go back to my old bottle opener no more struggling with the manual cork puller extricates the cork from the screw semi automatically also wine opener i love this device it's easy to use takes up little room and does exactly what it's supposed to do in a quiet efficient manner i'd definitely buy more for gifts item shipped timely good quality product item as described it does its job and works really nice the product looks really expense as well so if you need to impress someone this may be a good gift great wine opener although it lasts about years for the price that's totally fine with me this is the second one we have purchased super great and easy to operate what a painless way to remove wine corks i love this product great price unlike others i ve purchased the cork never gets stuck inside this one plus it comes with a cutter that opens with one easy twist a great buy in my opinion love it makes wine opening much much easier well worth the money love it this is so easy to use previous manual openers have been very difficult for me with a bad neck no strain using this at all love this works grreat got this as a gift for my friend and he really likes it he insisted i leave a review it's probably a bit on the bigger side but it's the easiest wine opener to use if space is not a problem this is perfect the opener is similar to other brands on the market it looks nice so it isn't an eye sore on the counter you have to be careful if the cork is stubborn the motor is strong enough to keep turning the corkscrew and it may just rip up the cork liked it so much i bought one as a birthday gift for my friend works well first gadget my wife loves works great a little tricky to get used to the first few times but i love it now i got this for my aunt about years ago and it still runs nicely the cutter works perfectly to get the wrapper off to reveal the cork love this product very easy to use sleek and stylish looks great on my bar this is my rd oster cordless wine bottle opener over the years always come back to this model nice gift idea also i got this for a friend and she absolutely loves it she enjoys drinking wine and i thought that she might like to have one and she loves it thank you so much works great nice this is my second one of these i absolutely love this wine opener it comes with a cutter to cut the foil and then you can easily remove any court without any pulling or breakages that's it's cordless this is the best product i have ever purchased the description and performance are so far beyond my expectations it is amazing i will never open a bottle of wine again with out this it's that good i'm purchasing and sending this opener to all my friends get one i promise i promise you it's that great bottle opener arrived as promised and works perfectly no problems good product i like to keep a simple on my reviews and only answer what people really care about i do not do pictures or videos as i have a job and this does not pay my bills it is just a way to help the regular joe like me make an informed decision i do not get free or discounted products for review you will get my unbiased review of product does it work yes i bought this for opening wine bottles and it does not disappoint is it easy to use yes pros works as intended cons none note drink responsibly great and easy to use i love it gone are the days of messing up the cork i've been using this wine opener for years and it opens wine

out of using an old fashioned cork screw works great have one myself and given as gifts so far works well great addition this works great but you definitely need to leave it on the charger as it loses charge quickly love it so easy to open up a bottle of wine now my absolute favorite works like a charm and i love the wine cutter that's included in the set makes for hassle free easy opening it works thou i find it a bit awkward to use i always end up puncturing the entire cork which doesn't thrill me works well motor has impressive torque directions could be better however i have to say that i had a little problem with this item after using it times it failed to eject a cork i was able to pull out the stuck cork the next few corks have come out perfectly hope this was a one time issue that self corrected great product and simple to use cut foil with supplied cutter press down button while the device is on the cork to remove it the device stops when the cork is off press the top button

loved it very easy to use super we love this wine opener this is actually a replacement for one that we received as a gift several years ago we tried going back to the old wine key and found we had become far too lazy so when this popped up at christmas time i snatched it up bought one for my wife for xmas she was sceptical at first but loves it now i also bought one for her our friend the winos are both delighted seriously the product works great looks cool and a super gift especially for the price this wine opener is user friendly and makes opening wine bottles a breeze i really like this product just wish i could physically see the cork come out easy to use must have for wine lovers great product easy to use does the job very satisfied love this i haven't charged it in months and still works great nice to have around would buy for a gift great quality would buy again good works smoothly and easily replaced one i have had for several years and it showed me how much the tired the old one had gotten i can again open sparkling wines and champagne the old one had given up nothing to say i received this as a gift and i was skeptical about it however after using it a few times i fell in love with it it opens bottles quickly and easily with no destruction of corks the charge can last anywhere from several months to a year depending on how much you use it i loved mine so much i purchased another one to give as a gift one word of caution if you are opening a wine bottle that has a plastic imitation cork it can destroy the opener easy to use works great works great it works no more hassle to open a bottle or to unscrew the cork from the manual metal thing wow if this wine bottle opener keeps working like it did the first time i used it i'm in heaven i'm and it has been hard for me to use all the various wine bottle openers out there some i'm just plain not strong enough to use others i have to put on the floor between my feet to get the leverage to push the ratchet operated screw into the cork this opener i just have to hold the bottle and it doesn't take very much strength to do that and the opener whirs away it opens the bottle and then pushing on a different part of the button releases the cork i'm in heaven gave as gifts i have one and love it holds a charge a long time i love mine so much i bought another for my daughter we love it good nice wine opener great wine opener we love it and looks nice on your counter this replaced one lost in a move and we are very satisfied works so easy and opens several bottles on a charge this is the fourth one i have had of these they work great and get plenty of use this is the best cordless opener but they only last a couple of years i use mine all the time though it is small compact and i just leave it on the counter it will open quite a few bottles before it runs down i would buy it again seems to work well and doesn t take up a lot of space love this wine opener this is my second one i had the last one for four years my only issue is that sometimes the cork gets stuck on the cork screw and can be difficult to get off nd one i have purchased this one as a gift both work great and have had no issues i use it for bottles a week and still going strong had one of these before and this is it's replacement it works well but the last one only lasted three years easy to use and fast nice powerful motor removes cork quick and smooth battery last long time looks good on counter too you have to cut the foil or it gets caught in the device and will clog up the cork from coming back out christmas gift great useful bought this for my girlfriend for christmas great product makes opening wine bottles a breeze a must have especially if you go through or bottles a night instead of it getting harder and harder to open bottles the more you drink its just as easy every time very easy to operate and comes with a tool cutter too my daughter and son in law love it thank you just got it works great great love it can't imagine my life without it an awesome product it helps us moms party better lol ok works fine but a bit tough to return to holder i can t imagine my life without this product super quick and easy to use can't believe i held off on getting one of these for so long makes life a lot easier than the old fashioned wine openers so easy to use can not go wrong ordering this i love the ease of opening bottles now christmas present a gift to myself i love it great christmas gift used once so far seems solid no issues looks real nice on the charger good purchase but after a year the charging base stopped working bought a different brand this time works well love this i have been looking for a good wine opener i only had it for a few months and already brought one for my mom i love my bottle opener this is my second one the first dropped the battery after years of use love my new toy i should have bought this a long time ago so easy to use will be giving these away next year for xmas thanks very nice product a must have for any wine lover great gift for any home i've had mine for years and it still works perfectly i will never go back to a traditional corkscrew was very happy with this purchase as i gave for gifts from a recommendation from a friend who has one and swears by it works and looks great works better then we were hoping charge lasts a long time so much easier than any lever type opener works easy to use great price it broke in about a months but we abused it it works great we will buy another have one of these at home and bought one for my mom for her birthday really effective and easy to use for what you pay worth the buy i have had one of these for many years maybe as long as i forget it has worked reliably stayed charged no issues yesterday i tried to open a bottle that as it turned out had a stuck cork never had that occur before the cork didn't budge and i wan't paying attention and i didn't let off the button bang crunch crack the cork screw went down in the cork as it should and drug the guts of the unit with it the case halves parted the case screws broke off and the opened like an aligator's mouth and passed over the top of the bottle what a sight guess i'll buy another one i only knocked off a star because well it did break so far the perfect thing to open the wine we all struggle to open them but with this it just got easy this item looks and feels solid opens bottles wonderfully great product makes opening wine bottles so easy i drink a lot of wine so this saves a lot of time so i can spend it drinking this is a replacement for the one i wore out over the past years so far so good bought it as a gift it works and we love that it charges and can be taken on picnics with us love this product we are not huge wine drinkers but this product might entice us to drink some more it s very easy to use and stays plugged in at our house on the counter especially during the holiday season once i got the hang of it i can't stop using it so much better than the manual ones for all my wine drinkers this product is so easy and convenient back in my younger less hangover prone self purchases this on impulse in a rural walmart in nd yeah nd long story i convinced my then roommate that this was an investment and i had to have it for the it was back then as the years past i laughed and laughed about my investment remark because well it was this thing was fearless i must have opened hundreds of wines easily with it and it has always been a conversation starter when brought out in front of company fast forward years later i retrieve it to open a bottle and my clumsy hands drop in on the floor now like my phone i ve most likely dropped it before multiple times and the button broke off no harm no foul it did last me years and if i held the button in the correct place it continued to work which was great in the moment yet sad so sad my bf knew how much i loved it and so did he because he found it fun to open bottles just as much as me and was gracious enough to purchase me another for christmas maybe santa who knows but it was a different brand it was hard for me to part with but i will always have those investment memories my girlfriend had an aneurism that handcaped her left hand pretty good since her doctors told her she never walk again so i bought this for her and it does exactly what it claims to she is happy and that makes me happy don't know yet works great so simple and works great works great works great very easy to use and works great exactly what i wanted love it works perfectly have this item loved it so much bought my friends easy to use looks great this makes opening a wine bottle effortless we keep it on the charger when not in use and just grab it as needed it works really well on a variety of bottles purchased for my mom n law i already o an one and love it great wine opener gave this as a gift to my mom who struggles with weak hands due to arthritis she was really happy with it and so know she will use it frequently for entertaining in the future i would highly recommend this as a gift for anyone who loves wine and doesn t have an electric opener yet i love this wine bottle opener the product is really well made and works perfectly i expect to have several more of these over the years works great perfect if your a wine lover i bought one as a gift then one for myself everyone that comes over and uses it ends up buying one super fast and easy to use makes a great gift thanks best opener ever well made easy to use i've had mine for years and recently bought one as a gift for my brother he loves it not bad but in ugly box good price compared to similar electric wine bottle openers working fine after opening dozens of wine bottles it has replaced my rabbit as my favorite way to uncork a bottle easy to use opens my wine faster than traditional methods this product is amazing i feel totally spoiled though because when i'm in a situation where i have to open a bottle without it i miss it i ve now purchased three of these because they re such popular gifts i gave one to my mom years ago and both of my sister in laws wanted one as well so i bought two more and they re a hit it s so easy to use and if you place the opener on the bottle incorrectly it won t try to take the cork out instead it will reverse automatically to allow you to readjust for a straighter position on the bottle so it doesn t puncture through the side of the cork it s so much more convenient having this on the counter within reach rather than going through every kitchen bar cabinet drawer trying to locate a cork screw to manually open the bottles easily the best money i ve spent she loves it very easy to use bought as a gift for my grandmother to make it easier for her definitely recommend product received as advertised very smooth quiet does the job i would recommend happy with my purchase so far so good nice design and great price works great i ve had one of these for over a year and i loved it so much i bought another for a gift i use it all the time this little guy is worth every penny seriously it comes with a foil cutter works great and i've never had an issue with it not completely extracting a cork makes life so much easier and i've had numerous guests ask me where i got it they make excellent stocking stuffers for those wine lovers in your life bought one for a friend after receiving it as a gift opens wine bottles with no effort and very easily holds charge very well it's been a year since i last charged it i swear lol it works it's easy it doesn't get stuck works well priced right total game changer for me i don t know how i functioned before this this is my second oster cordless electtic wine opener i had my first for years and loved how easy it was to use got this as a birthday gift for my friend and a year later she still uses it all the time great gift i will for sure call this one of my best investments for myself even with the newer crap corks i have yet to have this thing not get me into a bottle once you hit that couple bottles in night where you're worried about embarrassing yourself in front of your friends pull this guy out and be a hero i got this for my husband and he loves it really worth it this thing actually works and everyone who uses it at our parties want one so i make them gifts without fear and very reasonable in price i bought two of these as a gift for my father and father in law these openers significantly eased their job since they were not happy with their corkscrews therefore i would give stars love it works as described easy set up love the cutter too i purchased multiple of these and gave them all as present and finally decided to get one for myself after having so much trouble opening wine bottled just place the opener on the cork wait a couple seconds and poof the cork is out no need to struggle to get grip on the bottle or making sure it is screwed in correctly with a manual corkscrew this opener does what it is made to do no need for frills of the fancy more expensive openers bought at xmas presents everyone loves great item highly recomend works well very sleek look easy to use and works well easy to use no more broken corks amazing super easy to use great gift looks and feels like it is good quality works great this is a cool gadget still get confused with pressing up or down to remove cork need more practice going out to order another case of wine great for christmas present no more suffering when it comes to wine time this bottle opener makes all my wine dreams come true with ease all right works perfect and great price i love this wine opener i've given several as gifts love it better than what we had we got this fo my mom after she broke corkscrews in a row including a more expensive rabbit wine opener that was years ago and it still works like new and she drinks a glass of wine of day so it gets its fair share of use would definitely recommend for simplicity of use and longevity i love this product so much i bought one for my parents it is easy to use and convenient enough that it doesn't take too much room on the counter it also comes with a foil cutter to get the foil off the top of the wine bottle i like how quiet it is when i am using it and the cork comes out whole of the time i have had a few times the cork has gotten cracked but not sure if it was the wine opener or the wine bottle having a dry cork it takes the hassle out of opening wine bottles does exactly what i expected and was a great price it does take some effort on your part to keep the device in place which makes me think it wouldn't be ideal for older people however i could be wrong and it might be great for older people it's a hell of a lot easier than the corkscrew thing with wings i've broken two of these and seems like it would last longer no more corkscrews openers this little handy thing is amazing i can t believe i live without it this long it s easy it does everything itself amazing thank you i love this thing i've had it now for a few years and it's the only thing i use when opening a bottle i don't have to charge it often either so it's usually unplugged highly recommend i leave it sitting on the charger all the time so it is always ready once the wife failed to place it on the charger correctly and it eventually ran out of power and wouldn't work i determined that it just needed to charge that's all it took this little device just works as expected better than any other i have ever tried love it someone gave us an upscale oster blender years ago for our marriage both still work fine awesome product purchased one for my parents as well although theirs broke after alot of use they were happy to buy a new one due to the low cost and great value works like a charm had for over years and its still going strong love it and works great i have had the oster electric corkscrew for a few years and it has performed flawlessly for the price it is a great deal however in the last year or so the black backing has begun to soften to the point that my hand gripping the unit comes away with black residue that can only be washed off by heavy scrubbing not good an alert to oster customer service was ignored i live in a year round warm weather climate that might have to be factored into the weakness of the item thanks awesome i love this product it also makes a great gift we keep extras in stock i ve had one for about years given it as gifts twice a super gadget that works very well has been very dependable great wine opener and very easy to use love it also i gave this to several friends they love it too exactly what i wanted perfect the best of the wine openers we have tried over the years quick and easy really nice christmas gift this is a replacement for a much more expensive brand that finally wore out it works just as well looks better and takes up a bit less space at first i thought mine was broken but i was doing it wrong cut the wrapper with the cutter that it comes with little loop hooked onto the back of the charger stand push down on the wine opener with pressure while pressing the down arrow button as you hold the bottle as well once the wine opener feels a little loose that means the cork is out remove the wine opener to reveal the open bottle press the upward arrow to release to cork cheers i bought of these both friends enjoy the ease of using i have an irrational fear of corks this is my favorite product ever wife prefers these over competitors i love the idea of a gadget to remove a cork since using a manual cork screw is difficult for me however and i m sure it s just user error i have a tough time getting the thing to line up properly and remove the cork the first time around perhaps practice makes perfect does the job but not all that speedily replaced an identical unit that gave out after five years or so it works great easy to set up perfect works perfect easy and doesn t hurt my hands we use this couple times a week and recently bought a second one to have on another level of our home we got the second one and it didnt work but they refunded us and we replaced it works very well just like the first very convenient great product super durable it shipped fast we ve had several electric wine openers this is the best yet it stops automatically when cork is out of bottle highly recommend works great this is our second oster wine opener our first lasted ten years and we didn't hesitate to buy another one they are great this thing is really cool works every time comes with its own charger trick is to hold the opener down while pressing the switch and hold on to the bottle below after press the up on the switch and poof out comes the cork great present love the compact style the foil cutter tucked in the back is convenient and easy to use great value for the price i have used this wine opener for several years and love it when my old one finally died i had to replace it with the same thing it is so easy to use and there is no effort involved in opening a bottle of wine best item i ve ever bought love this so far works great and we open a lot of wine worked great for a year and a half then started making odd clicking noises but still worked today only the reverse action works but not the removal action this is the nd electric wine opener we've had and they do quit after awhile guess we drink too much wine since the price is reasonable i really don't mind purchasing another one after months we love this so easy to use works great this is my go to gift for people i got this for my hubby and he s loving it so easy to use i gave this to my grandmother since its hard for her to use a wine key for bottles with corks in them she loved it so much she's actually bought at least more to give to her friends as presents two years later and it still works beautifully we bought this wine bottle opener to replace our previous automatic wine bottle opener which was a different brand these things are so great fast and easy to open a bottle with zero effort just hold it over the cork press the button and let this tool do the work we bought another one for my in laws so safe to say we would definitely recommend this and buy it again for gifts this is the second one of these i've purchased because i can't imagine life without it love it and it has proved to be durable the last one lasted more than years then just got tired great product easy convenient affordable and stylish love it the price very good trading money highly recommended this is a very useful tool very fond of it it is not as useless as other brands but this may be a good thing good product high quality pulled the cork out with no problem allowed us to partake of our favorite beverage without delay so amazingly easy to use it holds a charge for a long time and i like the foil cutter in the back con the charging light the top always stays red i have no idea when it's fully charged we leave it in the cabinet unplugged for months at a time getting it out when we need it occasionally i plug it in for a day or so though it's all guesswork as no fully charged indicator i have this and love it bought for gifts works perfectly love it i have no cartilege in my right wrist and i am of course right handed this product is a god send no exaggeration love my new wine opener it works great and quick and easy packaging was great instructions included charging base is small enough to stay on my counter top as well or it can be easily stored nice wine bottle opener easy to use and works perfect its cute but i haven't gotten the hang of this yet i keep blaming the issue on the cheap bottles of wine but it never removes the entire cork i end up destroying the cork trying to get it out i now have two they hold a charge for a long time like bottles or more i love it it's easy and quick to use gave two of these as gifts recipients loved them and i loved them too whenever i visited and needed to open a wine bottle something no wine drinker should be without takes the work out of dealing with bottle corks great tool at a modest price btw don't use it on screw tops lol excellent product i could not love this more easy to use and makes opening a bottle of wine super easy no more corks you can't get out broken corks easy to use works perfectly as advertized this works perfectly attractive to look at and does a great job just what i wanted great gift i bought it many times many of my friends like it it's very useful very easy to use performs great love it a must have ditto wonder product wonderful gift nice unit came with no instructions but was easy to assemble grips are super comfortable feels sturdy and stable works great this pull up bar is a staple all my friends have it and it is easy to use you just prop it up on the door frame and do pull ups then look out for them gains in the coming weeks it s here great just barely doesn't fit my door frame oh well i'm sure i'll have a frame worthy of this thing at some point it is still great for push ups and dips though perfect product with cheap price this product is awesome easy to assemble easy to put up and take down and it works great too hard for me but my son love it good to have very easy to install but not in an older house doorway i use it all the time worth super easy to put together tested it inmediately no issues grips were good firm bar this is the second wall bar ive order in my life not the same company this one is just as good price was good and no issues does the job great the bar is quick to assemble and fits over standard interior doors with a trim i like letting gravity stretch my back discs vertebra out after doing too much lifting easy and convenient it helps when don t have time to go to the gym glad i bought it awesome i ve been scared of these things breaking and falling down etc but i went on the reviews and i must say for the price i like it yeah the quality is a bit naff and it doesn t sit perfectly together but it hasn t fallen down and really helps with my training works great holds my weight and i am around so i am happy about that works well but it s a two piece bar and i m lbs so it feels flimsy but no marks on my door just can t get to aggressive with it this is a great product the price is amazing as well the instructions make putting it together a breeze i workout a lot and this was something i have always wanted now it is a invaluable need in my workouts aight it didn't fit the doorway i intended it for but that way my own fault it fits a standard door frame i'm about lbs and it holds me just fine i bout it to use for an indoor swing for my kids it works great for that one drawback is my husband ' hits his head if he tires to walk under it holding up great son still loves it and uses it often my son is happy with this workout bar we have it in a stair bedroom doorframe instructions are a bit unorganized but still very easy to install it works like a charm my bf loves it easy to assemble it even has foam to protect doorway doesn't fit all doors i didn't expect that i would use it for push ups as much as i do either i like and my kids like it too easy to assemble secure love the booklet it came with i use this every day as described sadly doesn't work on my doorway love it super easy to assemble and use use it everyday this product is the most useful and solid item on amazon i would highly suggest this to anyone very robust construction and very easy to install setup was very easy and it feels strong i am a lbs guy and it feels very sturdy i think this will last me for a very long time works great and i use it almost every day like one person said i would not use it if over lbs make certain you check door width older homes this cannot be hung on the door worth it good product pretty good for the price one of my resolutions for this year is to be able to do consecutive chin ups this bar is going to get me there i ll update in january in the meantime this piece of fitness equipment is easy to build install and use making regular practice an attainable goal it s also a great price word of advice make sure the top frame of your door also called casing lentil or header is not more than tall or this unit will not fit if you have decorative molding or a cornice on top of the frame see pic it will not fit no matter the size the molding will prevent a strong purchase between the wall and the bar our vintage home has these types of moldings throughout except in the renovated third floor space with door frames with doors with or without the metal clip you can remove the bar to close the door as well as to use the unit for floor exercises like pushups we bought a folding step stool so that our tween son can reach the bar without jumping up that kind of motion will definitely dislodge the unit leading to injury the bar is listed for up to pounds our individual weights are half of that but i do not allow the boys to use this without an adult spotter if you use this bar with care and caution especially when used by kids this pull up bar may be a good addition to your in home gym it is wonderful very good to use it works as described it's easy to assemble and didn't damage the door frame my back was hurting this is good things for my recovery it does everything as described the only one drawback is that for larger door frames this product will not work if it were adjustable to fit larger doorframes this would be better there is only one door frame in our house where this will work grandson is wearing it out simple and effective instructions as well as stable and durable when finished properly wish i would have bought one sooner working as intended excellent no problems encountered i am a big man lbs big when i decided to improve my physical fitness i wanted to include pull ups into the mix this bar was extremely easy to set up has born the weight and is still in great shape good job iron gym better than a cheaper one i had but i wouldn't call it near premium at all it's solid the wide grip is hard to grab because of the door frame though works good so far strong and multi purpose love love love thank you mgf i love this fits in my doorway and seems very sturdy i am pounds and was nervous at first but i love being able to practice pull ups from the comfort of my home very sturdy been using it for about weeks now i will update and let you know how it holds up in the months to come as expected but directions are awful i bought one of these for one of my sons they all loved it so when he moved out i had to buy another good quality product easy to put up and keeps my boys fit they love to challenge each other holds up on older smaller door frames good reminder to do a pull up each time you enter exit the room i was not expecting something so sturdy for it was super easy to set up and hang up with no tools required removal is easy as well it holds me and my husband who is lbs the bolts need to be better labeled so you know which to use where does the job well once assembled bought for my boys second one we ve had the first one lasted at least five years fits perfectly in the door arrived in a compact box very easy to assemble even if you can't follow instructions to save your life very sturdy construction the different hand grips make for a great way to work on your core also is great for push ups it can also be positioned for sit ups cool product works well does what its supposed to do great product if you actually use it this equipment was pretty strong useful but i can t practice yet why because my all doors are wider than length of the iron gym question how to few inches extend it works good has left a little bit of black scuff mark on the inside of the frame where the support rests against the top of the door jam this isn't a big deal for me it's very sturdy and easily supports my lbs i'm sure it would support more good seems sturdy and fulfills its purpose nicely does the job well easy to put together lightweight and can carry good amount of weight doesn t leave marks on the wall either it works and was easy to assemble me get very strong using this many workouts happen with this it stick on wall like fine wine no holes no drilling portable make bryce happy feels very sturdy in doorway little confusing to set up but me not very smart me workout in home now no one to rush bryce off the machine now thank you iron gym great item i ordered this for my husband he had one before and kept mentioning that he wanted another one so for i ordered it right away he said it's very easy to assemble and just what he had before no complaints from us this is great easy to put together and really easy to hang in doorway without damage bery sturdy works perfectly i'm able to get my pull ups in everyday now using this for tricep dips works out perfectly too i ve used it everyday since my purchase with no issues solid love hanging it on in my door frame makes me do pull ups every time i walk through went from barely hitting to doing a day years later it's still going strong good stuff helped me prepare for savage races very sturdy works perfectly in my door frame been using it everyday and i'm doing better already easy up quality strong much sturdier than expected it is simply four bolts and you re good to go three quick sets from each set of grips and i am sold i m not a crossfitter so no kipping just nice slow full range of motion and this thing is solid so far will update in a few months not bad i have a suggestion before you buy this product you had batter measure your door width and deep i have four door in my house but only have two door can fit this bar love it does pull ups for you i don't have the sturdiest door frames but it still hangs well and is completely steady i hang it up and use it every time i walk through the doorway day one i couldn't even do a full proper pull up and it's incredible how keeping at it helps you improve as silly as that sounds it's helped so much with my upper body strength but doesn't take time out of my way like a normal workout does it's perfect for what it's meant to be used for i don't have a doorway that i can leave open all the time but this takes literally a second to put up and take down as it just hangs on the door frame i bought this for my daughter who has always loved to scale the walls but she was getting too tall to really enjoy it anymore to satisfy her need to climb hang i got her this pull up bar and i am really glad i did she loves this thing i put black socks over the ends that touch the wall since some people complained about it leaving marks on the walls we have no marks and you can't even tell since the ends are black as well i would buy this again and recommend to others very well designed and built great for the price perfect for at home workouts good product easy to assemble and use great product simple to install and use as described holds a lot of weight sturdy easy to assemble stays in place limited only by your doorframe i'd imagine the iron gym is sturdy and put together well the only problem is that the box had no frame clip to hold in place i weigh lb's no damage to my door frame yet the dips are a no go unless you rig something lower on the door does the job stays put very sturdy i weigh and it does not even bend my son loves this and works great over a doorway no damage done to door casing i bought it for my son he loves it my son absolutely love this excellent quality definitely well made and easy assembly set up was easy it seems secure and it works well i'm up to reps of wide grip pull ups compared to the i could do when i first got it about a month ago it's pretty self explanitory it does the job pull ups chin ups and push up support not much else you can really say about these kind of things easy assembly and fair pricing as expected this has been great for my teenage boys it is mounted in the frame of our laundry room door they use it all day long as they pass by the door no issues at all super easy to put up like it and enjoy using it super light super resistant and extremely manageable for the level of performance it provides i'm over lbs and this item has no problem whatsoever taking my weight i love it works great just wish the cushion could be adjusted because my grip is that as wide as men use it everyday love this item very good quality my wife likes it works great for the price definitely doesn t seem as durable as some of the pricier ones but like anything you get what you pay for seems like it ll last a good years and i m satisfied with that for only worked way better than expected when i first opened the package it came off flimsy and looked like it was going to brake i was proved wrong this product works great for my needs and had held together well works great very sturdy and easy to put together because of the size and door fitting it's hard to do wide pull ups but regular pull ups and lower leg raises makes it easy to use at home or wherever i have owned several of these and they're great you just have to make sure it fits your door frame and surround area many bedroom and bathroom doorways are really too small for this and the unit is not adjustable i've found that doors along the size of exterior entryways are more suitable perhaps a side garage door etc that being said if it fits your door or is close enough there's a bit of wiggle room using the outer hand grips as pads it's a very solid and usable unit you will get many many years of use even if you use it all day long my son loves it i can already see upper body definition after only a couple of months quick and easy set up good materials i love this handy healthful contraption requires no screws to affix to the door and it seems very sturdy to hold a bodyweight the only glitch is that you can no longer close the door at all so plan on not being able to it's lasted me almost years still sturdy never had an issue works good in the bathroom doorway to get a quick back workout when needed recommend to everyone out there it arrived on time came with all the parts it was easy to set up and i'm liking the results from using it i got this for my mom so she can stretch in a way that's normally very difficult for her it's easy to assemble and seems very sturdy though i have never personally hung from it she specifically mentioned some of the ones she has seen when she's out shopping didn't seems as good as this one she likes it so i do too it was a great price i am happy with this purchase i ve purchased this same item twice after giving one away during a previous move strong and sturdy the only downside is it left some minor black marks from the foam on the trim in the doorway can be buffed out but was an unexpected flaw in the product great pull up bar for the money installed and its been solid since works great price is amazing great does it's job easy assembly no issues i'm ' ' at lbs it's very sturdy and i've had no issues doing pull ups chin ups it basically does the work out for you pros easy to assemble sturdy easy to use i m lbs and and i can use this comfortably cons don t over tighten screws hand grips have organic chemical smell after weeks still there not designed to swing from it is that i want thanks product as described no issues works as advertised sturdy i got this for my daughter who is i would not trust my wall door jam to support my weight while using this bar though love it but the grips wore off pretty quickly easy to put together and works great put it in the main hallway and my boys and i both use it all the time works well im and it supports my weight good got a little loose after semi regular use no abuse but was still functional my son wanted this for christmas and he's just loving it he enjoys doing pull ups on it very secure great product can't beat it for the price we've been using our pull up bar for about a year now and it's still going strong easy to hook on any door we have it on our closet door definitely recommend totally convenient and strong too i stopped lifting free weights and use this daily instead i think it's better exercise all around when added to my treadmill workout works as advertised great price and great quality i am a ' lb guy and it holds up well very easy to put together sturdy build with quality soft grips fits nicely on the door even kids love it sturdy and useful pretty sturdy grips are comfortable and well positioned assembly and installation took around five minutes very nice perfect for what i need easy to assemble and use works great it works amazing and very stable i'm working on my pull ups and abs and it does a great job give it a try easy to assemble and install perfect this is really the best piece of home equipment you can buy for starters got my pull ups to increase dramatically with consistent practice very sturdy and solid doesn't make me feel like it will fall apart as i use it did its job stars but the plastic bar eventually broke in half so stars i just got this today and it s very easy to put together maybe min and it fits on my door fine i had one of these years ago and it worked great bought it again for another residence but there's not enough space above the doors for it to anchor so i can't use it most doorways don't have this issue but if yours does it probably won't work this iron gym provides you the opportunity to have a full body workout in the convenience of your home which is awesome the only reason why i cannot give stars is because the package did not include assembly directions so i had to look it up online overall a really good piece of exercise equipment for an awesome price no complaints i needed it to make my sex swing portable so i attached a d ring to it now i can work out anywhere i want or have some fun anywhere i want lol this was just the thing we needed i didn't use it at all for pull ups or work outs whatsoever i needed something to put in my door way so that i could use an autistic swing for my kids as well as other things for my adhd child to climb up so i got this and since the bars are a little to wide for swings to be attached to it so i used ankle straps for cable machines that had metal hoops on it to make the swing be able to hook to the pull up bar we also use a child's climb rope which nicely hangs their as well and has never budged from the area where it rests on it was easy to put together and since the weight limit is i feel safe that my kids and their toys that are on there will not come down it is very sturdy and i am not going to lie at first i put all my weight on while it was on the doorway there just to make sure the molding wasn't going to come down just because i am paranoid about things like that when evolving kids and it has never budged once i weigh about pounds so over all great for our needs this is great it's easy to assemble easy to use easy to move when needed and it's great exercise easy to put together very sturdy easy to assemble quality product i thought the plastic pieces and center connection might be a problem but so far so good bought this for my son years old for christmas he uses it every day i was concerned how well it would work hanging in the door but it handles everything he gives it we have a small home so it is excellent because he puts it up when using it and then takes it down when not in use works excellent for him lbs and holds my husband lbs grandson loves it easy to put together and use in doorway used up to lb with ease it fits easily over the door however it does scuff up the door frame a bit great for my teenage daughter working on her core grandsons mass present he it works as intended good for small workouts before or after bed sturdy and easy to install and use no nails or hardware required fits right on our doorjamb we use it every day and it's been great to supplement our routine with a little body weight resistance training pull ups chin ups high quality no wearing out of the grips or pads yet this thing will last forever and nice that we can take it with us if we move great product easy to use easy to install on the frame of the door i would recommend it love doing the pull ups but never had anywhere to do them with this perfect item i can do them straight at home and very sturdy i really like this item having in a main doorway constantly reminds me to do a few whenever i pass by it was easy to put together and is very solidly constructed the pads and brace don't damage the doorway at all and despite how light it seemed it's sturdy the only concern i have is that the hand grips seem like they might wear out before the rest of it but we'll have to see so far so good i bought this for my yr old but my husband and i both enjoy using it it's great for stretching and super easy to install easy setup and works great my kids use this virtually every time they walk by it i use it as well with great results easy quick install and easy to move to another door frame gift he loves it was pretty easy to put together its pretty sturdy i have no issues with it whatsoever good product great to have i purchased this in august of and it has served its purpose well assembly was easy if i remember correctly it took me less than minutes i don t use it for anything else other than pull ups and chin ups but i m sure it ll be good for pushups and sit ups i question how effective dips would be on this since it seems a bit too low to do a full movement dip it has handled my weight lbs well and has not started to bend or sag i do have a couple of complaints the padding on the bar where it meets the door frame should be thicker mine degraded without me noticing and the actual solid bar started to push against my doorframe now my doorframe is damaged i recommend putting a sock between the doorframe and the bar to provide more padding for protection my other complaint is that the flat piece that goes against the wall above the doorframe could discolor your wall it did mine i recommend putting something in between the wall and the flat plastic part to prevent against this other than that this is a well built product that performs as advertised i've had this now for about weeks now and i love it it is my first pull up bar and i currently have no complaints i am ' lbs and feel safe with it the only reason i am giving it stars instead of is because i am not sure how long it will last i've read other reviews of it breaking but read more positive ones that say they've had theirs for years hopefully that is the case for me too if you're ' or taller this wont work in a regular door way for you very happy with this purchase my year old asked for a pull up bar for christmas and i ordered this one bc it had mostly good reviews and wasn't very expensive it's been used daily by all three of my kids it seems to be very well made and does what it's meant to do perfectly very good thanks love this thing definitely has been great for getting a quick workout in no matter what easy to put together and sturdy perfect workout for a small space works very good and doesn t mess up walls at all bought his for our son he loves being able to do pull ups with this on his bedroom door it it s easy to put and and take down so it doesn t get in the way when the door needs to be closed great thx this bar by far surpassed all other gifts not only has my son used it everyday and is increasing his endurance and muscle mass but so have i love this product great convenient product don't need to go to the gym as much and it fits most doorways sturdy product works very well with my workout routine it was used so i can be angry nice fit in my bedroom door now i have an insane upper body physic i love it my apartment has various sized door frames and it only works on one of them it would work on another if the sidebars weren't so long or could be adjusted but it hasn't damaged the door frame at all or the paint or anything my friend uses it and has swung around on it and it all holds together it has sturdy rubber pads that rest against the door frame have had issues on the past with similar products that had only foam for the pads great if you can't get out to a gym and want to loosen up your back works as advertised and price is good works great got this as a christmas gift for a family member he loved it so much he started to use it right away one yo yo of a story it helps me up and lets me down awesome i love it i work out by this everyday before taking a shower good product compare to priceeee so gooddddd great bar strong and solid i've used it for everything except for pull ups another win for mom the boy didn t even say he wanted this for christmas but i got it i can read minds apparently and he loves it he s preparing for navy rotc and every pull up counts he uses it everyday good enough decent product solid stays in place and works well my only gripe is the foam which wears out rather quickly my son received this as a gift but this was the second he received which is why we returned it great workout bar for both wall and floor exercises bought this for my boyfriend and it fits in the doorway of the kitchen perfectly works as good as the expensive brand name ones he loves it perfect for home gyms home workouts really gotta buy this awesome product nothing negative to be talked about it's got tools to assemble what's necessary for the product and got a hook to hold the product when you try to hang it to the top back of your door and that way you never worry about this to be fallen apart i was worried about this one from being fallen apart from the door however upon receiving it it just went away and noticed it was wasting time worrying about its safety in uses you will know when you receive it my son loves this contraption he really gets a good workout and we have family competitions on who can do the most pull ups super simple to put together bought for my year old son he loves it this is a great high quality pull up bar my husband and i have used it for a couple weeks now and it is still working great definitely would recommend i'm lbs and this item works as advertised just fine i use it with the support slings for abs as well my only wish is that the handles were angled for lat' pull ups build quality is about out of good enough for most but heavy guys may want to pony up for top o the line models fits great on my door easy to take down and put up again sturdy my husband assembled it in just a few minutes i pull it down for push ups then easily hang it for pull ups great way to get in extra exercise no damage at all to my walls or doors easy to assemble and works great it does leave marks on the door moulding however i taped old clothes around the areas that would touch the door frame and hopefully that prevents indentations color leaking the other comments mentioned it was easy to put together sometimes the bar moves when i grab onto it which scared me the first few times but it hasn't broken or fallen from the door so it's probably fine got it early easy to put together works i love it i've been using this bar for about a year now and it's held up well i'm at lbs so i can't say how it would hold up for heavier weight but i'm very pleased with the product works with any door with molding and space on either side you can do quite a few exercises this was a christmas gift and was liked by the recipient works great love it this bar solves a problem with having a chinning bar that doesn't require screws or other damage to my door jams the l shaped brackets do interfere with the hand spacing i like for pull ups but it's not that big of a deal it's more important that i be able to stow it and not modify my door ways to install it please note that this is not a heavy duty chinning bar i can see the bar flexing in the middle when i use it and i'm about so i'm not going to let my relatives use it i like it just with it could have a different design so i could do pull ups on the other side of my door where the ceiling is higher my husband and i love it it supports both of our weights very well me lb and also my husband lb we use it almost every day and we did not have any issues with it so far i was skeptical at first but this is actually a really good product it actually fits in the door and it does not fall off it looks scarier than it actually is it is very safe my boys love it sturdy safe easy to assemble install would you believe we ordered this for our yr old future ninja warrior he was esstatic when he opneed it for christmas very sturdy construction fit great in his door way i expect the whole fmly will have stronger biceps in the new yr love it great chin up bar very sturdy and worth the money very easy to assemble very strong works on pretty much any sized door and can hold a good weight i would totally buy it again great product it's holding up well after months of use i expect it to last years or until i can't do pull ups anymore that said i weigh only lbs i don't know how well it would hold up and perform for someone who are heavier easy set up good quality this was a gift for a friend he said it works well and he uses it often my son wanted to get better at pull ups for school testing he's using it in his bedroom and there have been no marks on the wall or door frame very solid design and super easy to put up and take down love this product and it was priced reasonably it serves its purpose would recommend just as expected works great very good piece of home gym equipment great for chin ups pull ups and leg crunch raises for abs doesn't fit any of my doorways but that's my fault for not measuring i guess it went together easily and looks sturdy does what you need it to do no complaints works amazing i love how it fits any standard bedroon door perfectly it is a little loose in the middle but it isnt there when you put it on your door it fits perfectly and feels very sturdy this is a awesome one sturdy stays well fun to use sturdy and does the work very cool been using it on the ground for push ups and i'm already seeing results when i first bought this bar i set it up and used it maybe one time after trying it out i couldn t even do one pullup but i kept at for about week and by the end of that week i could easily do i made a game plan every week i would push my max and add five more pull ups a few minutes after since using this routine i have noticed serious changes i increased muscle mass lost weight and was even able to tone some pre existing muscles since i ve bought this product i have lost a majority of my gynecomastia gained inches on my biceps toned all my upper body muscles and even set a path for a six pack after using this bar i can confidently say that i have increased my max amount of pull ups from to comfortably i would absolutely reccomend this to anyone who wants to get ripped without leaving home i've been using this workout bar in my apartment for the past six months with great success for one thing it's ever present so i have no excuse for not using it and it is easy to attach to the door frame with no apparent damage for another it works i went from one pull up to six pull ups after three months and can now do eight pretty good for an year old codger robert c ross december gets the job done great bar for a great price don't expect anything fancy schmancy here i will say i feel as though there could have been more of the foam covering on the bars but i would recommend this for anyone looking for a cheap workout solution i have owned this pull up bar for years in that time i have weighed up to lbs i have used this in several different homes and it works as advertised i do pull ups chin ups leg raises elevated push ups tricep chair dips it has held up perfectly i like the idea of using toilet paper rolls on the ends to prevent indents on door trim however the foam pads do well as long as you're not swinging or kipping fits standard doors or skinnier worked as expected sturdy and cheap what more can you ask for good xmas gift for him the original is best for the main reason it s effective easy to put together place it and work out no bs thank you my grandson loves it very easy to put together yet extremely sturdy once you have very lightweight to carry fits really well over the door frame highly impressed with this product great product we all love it great product works as advertised great price it does what it supposed to do especially when i dnt feel like goin to the gym works as expected it s good quality sturdy fits great on my door lets hope it helps me tone it has been great for pull ups and push ups works well in the door frame surprisingly good quality very strong material probably the best pull up bar i ve tried makes you army strong it's caused some damage to the door frame but holds well was easy to assemble easy to take on and off the door frame works as i'd expect stars very sturdy and stable will fit to any standard door frame just assembled and tested it today what a game changer love it i have had this a while now and have used it regularly besides pull ups i put in on the floor and use it for push ups which is actually my favorite thing to use it for so far i have not had any black marks as some have mentioned left on my door frame but time will tell with that bar is sturdy feels like it will hold up to most anything and the materials are strong this is a great product that i would recommend to anyone works as advertised simple design easy to put together the rest is up to you do those reps get stronk i like how i can feel the burn all the way down to my abs so the bar is fine and works great but the piece of metal used to keep it attached to the door broke after the first use now i am going to have to try and find a replacement part or just make one myself otherwise it's a good product just watch out you might hurt yourself from the fall like i did very good product for work outs it's a must have sturdy does the job easy to assemble and install perfect interdasting how it hooks over the door trim figured my fat would have tore it down but so far so good get swoll it's been pretty good so far few months now everything it needs to be sturdy that's all you can ask for i love it really quick to assemble and latches on to the door securely without having to drill holes in the wall it leaves a few marks but very hard to tell love it very good quality getting swole this is a great bar but i live in an older house with a ton of large molding please be aware that you need a normal doorway to be able to hang this up if the width of wood between the door opening is more than inches you will probably not be able to use this otherwise product seems to be well made i love this thing best home gym equipment you can get be careful for the door you put it on as it can damage it slightly easy to use does what it's supposed to do super easy to install nice product works well super easy to assemble and so far so good no issues love this this bar is fantastic i put it in my basement and hold regular contests with my friends as to who can do the most pull ups typically we're in our boxers but nothing romantic goes on this club founded mostly through craigslist is all about dat fitness lyfe newbeginnings when i was in prison i didn't get the opportunity to work out on such a bar but thanks to the iron gym total upper body workout i am five pounds heavier and can lift large boxes are my job at staples thanks amazon i greatly appreciate it sincerely diego so easy to install love this thing thanks strong sturdy and still makes me feel weak just like it should easy to put together and use our only difficulty was finding a doorway in our house which would suit as our door trims are quite deep it has now found its place in our kitchen and gets regular daily use the various handles allow for a good range of different exercises and the padded sections provide extra comfort and reasonable grip it's okay but you're better off finding a bar where you have to jump to you should be hanging on the bar for a starting position it is what it is holds my weight of feels secure during use exactly as described great product this thing honestly gives me motivation to workout just by its presence on my door this motivation got me some serious results too just by using it for a month you can also use it to do push ups on the ground the materials used to make it are ok you get what u paid for on this one i weigh and it works for me assembly was easy if ur not a simpleton would buy agian it is very strong iron bar fits good in all standards frame doors this was recommended by my acupuncturist to stretch out my muscles in my back it works great for that it goes together and mounts easily without making permanent marks to your door frame or wall pretty good very useful i have been used it for a month and it seems quite durable now i can work out when i am at home easy assembly this is my second one had to buy a new one because the foam on the handles was starting to crack i had my old one for a few years different brand same concept seems like quality material fits perfect in the door frame pretty strong and sturdy although i only used this to practice pullups on a door frame i am lbs although i would put white socks and a white t shirt between the contact points of the bar support and the door frame and wall so you don't create black smudges due to the friction between the the plastic and the wall fits very securely and is solid in quality only drawback is that the width isn't adjustable used this for travel and some of the hotels had wider doors for their bathroom which made this unusable for pull up workouts but there is a lot of versatility in what you can do with it fortunately much better than a straight bar good as discribed wish i was determined to workout more with this guy but it has helped train me to do a pull up or amazing it helps my son grow he s ft in already it works easy set up and very sturdy fits well in door way sturdy and my children love using it works very well can hold your weight very well and sturdy have used it on about occasions so far doing p x and works pretty well using it on an inner doorframe older house and seems to hold up good very sturdy and worth the money only thing i see missing is it said dvd workout video inside i did not find anything inside nor no links to get that easy installation after two months of use it is still holding up good but leaves a black mark near the edges of my door where that horizontal bar touches the door frame so i am reducing one star works great very helpful at home we use it almost everyday great quality i haven t been able to find a pull up bar that fits my oddly sized old italian houses door frames anywhere i was so excited when this one worked i love it would recommend very practical easy to assemble easy to install great product also the ends where it connects to the wall have rubber witch is definitely a plus the old one i have didn't and the grips started to split and come off this pull up bar is excellent i goto the local gym maybe times a week due to my schedule and just having a reasonable goal to accomplish therefore i sometimes have an itching to get in a workout but not spend hours in the gym the pull bar does the trick after i brush my teeth or if i'm waiting for water to boil when cooking i throw up this bar on the door and crank out maybe to feel the burn i could use it more so for a full workout because of the push up handles but i think i like it the most is because i can really get the body working in a short set of pull ups it's also portable and easy to store some folks leave their bar up at all times but i have my girlfriend in the house and i'm sure she wouldn't appreciate the vibe of a pull up bar in front of the bedroom that's why it's great that i can easy take it off and store it in the closest without taking too much space overall not a bad tool for a decent price son loves it works exactly for what i need it to it's stable in the door frame and sturdy enough to support my weight product is nice and all but received a damaged one has some scratches and one dented area still working after months works great my teenage son loves it uses it daily easy to put up and take down using it pretty often and still holding up perfectly i purchased this as a gift for my teenage son who has recently gotten into weight training the directions were clear and it was easy for him to assemble after a quick safety lesson he has been using it daily and is really happy with it it was a great alternative to an expensive piece of equipment and is really nice for days when we don't have time to make it to the gym i highly recommend it arrived on time works as described the set up was simple and it worked i'm lbs easy breezy assembly and installation it seems a bit on the cheaply made side i think it'll dump me on my ss one day but so far so good after about a month out of the box took just a few minutes to put together takes only a couple of seconds to install in a doorframe feels sturdy and solid with comfortable hand grips wide grip narrow grip chin up grip and neutral grip i prefer this type of pullup bar to a larger metal frame sort of design as it fits easily in your closet for storage this bar would be perfect to take in your car trunk so you can always work on your pullups i love it it fits perfectly in my door and has never fallen down it is good made and resistant it is also very good for push ups i don't like to do pull ups at the gym unless they're weighted i can do all my bodyweight pull ups at home now fantastic love it perfect for pull ups it's amazing i love the functionality of this product it really does what it promises this is a must to anyone one who is starting or wants to starts to lift or do calisthenics so easy to install and i love that i didn't have to screw holes into a wall holds the weight wasn't as universal for doors as i hoped but does fit one door in my house the issue is the thickness of the molding this took about minutes to put together and it sits on the top of the door trim it's nice because it doesn't have to stay in place and can be taken down after using or used for other work outs as shown in the instruction manual i like it easy to install and use still need to be better at using regularly i love this thing pull ups every morning for a year now i bought this for my stepson and he uses this religiously i bought one for my adult daughter too it fits in a standard doorway nicely this looks great on my door frame it gives people the impression that i work out up until they see my body my wall was too thick to actually mount it around easily i had to do some carving and quick fixes so just double check the depth of your frame great product compact and easy to assemble i love my pull up bar it hangs gloriously over the door between my kitchen and utility room looking at it every day makes me feel more than just athletic i feel like a strong and powerful woman i can only imagine the surge of invincibility coursing through my veins after sets of pull ups i can only imagine it 'cause i'm still pulling up whilst standing on a stool nice addition to my fitness regiment perfect for what it is intended for i have even hooked up my trx straps and used them with this very comfortable to use super sturdy and easy to build easy to install love it works great and with no holes in the wall this is a must for your home workout very versatile it is very easy to set up grip is very comfortable although you still end up with callouses feels very secure when mounted it should come with a warning warning you are not as strong as you thought you were this bar is amazing very sturdy and my three kids are doing pull ups daily no damage to my doorframe my little one loves it and wants big muscles i am using it for more than months daily use no problems faced easy to assemble and quite durable this pull up bar is amazing it was very easy to assemble and even easier to hang up on my doorframe i started off not able to do one pull up and one month later i am able to do every time i walk by my room i do pull ups this product is for sure the best pull up bar out there and i highly recommend it to anyone i think it absolutely worth its money the only downside i see that deserves less than stars is weak center of the horizontal bar where two pieces connect to each other plastic gasket immediately broke there it works little assembly required i've owned this product for years and use it several times per week the hand grips are starting to show some wear but overall it has held up well if you hang gymnastic rings from it you can use it for dips as well perfect fit easy to assemble great item if used properly ships in just the product box but mine made it damage free really great piece of exercise equipment i recommend highly to all i totally recommend you buy from amazon directly as other sellers outsource inferior substandard knockoffs i bought one from a u s seller from ebay and noticed the difference in quality between that one and this genuine pro fit amazon version iron gym works great just a little tough getting into and out of position in doorway exactly as picture very easy to assemble simple and sturdy enough it was easy to assemble and easy to set up and remove from the door frame so we use it love it wonderful product would do business with again it's amazing great pull up chin up bar attaches to doorway with ease the best workout bar available for the cost hard on my walls but that's not the products fault could be wider it's durable and stands up to my weight lbs everything i expected it to be easy assembly set up and use not particularly expensive and i'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a bar easily assembled and my son loves it fairly sturdy make sure you have solid doorways good purchase sturdy and ready to use right out of the box easy to put together and very sturdy works great for in home and for the price all the guys in the house really like this and use it everyday definitely recommend excellent quality for that price great tool to work out home nice and sturdy my son loves his new toy great but not perfect very easy to install fits perfect on door this works as its supposed to i'm lbs if i weighed more i'd be skeptical as it doesn't seem very sturdy i love it i've had it for a couple months and still use it almost every day it isn't leaving scuffs on my door frame and it's great for doing sit ups and even pushups with iron gym's pullup bar is a top of the line the durability and convience of the bar allow you to have a great workout just about anywhere i've seen great improvement in my biceps back and lats ever since i started consistently using the bar this bar is a great value for the price it took about minutes to put together and i use it every day it shows no signs of breaking after owning it for a few months if you are into working out or would like to start this is a great piece of equipment delivers what it says very stable set up in our laundry room door frame way better than paying for a gym subscription good quality product excellent quality improvement from previous model don't look at other options this is what you need love it the box said my boyfriend would get ripped quick it did not disappoint within in minutes his upper body was ripped he almost tore his shirt we're both very happy with this product good product hold well in my doorframe no issues if you gotta door you gotta gym fat d crew works will haven't had any issues with this very satisfied with purchase another item i should have gotten years ago supports my pound frame ez supports up to pounds claims the directions i believe it i'm already more toned fit from doing pull ups for less then a month now granted i can only do two pull ups at a time but i couldn't even do one when i first got it just hanging as long as possible tighens the body great for anyone serious about working out ez to assemble dissasemlbe which will come in handy for traveling bought this for our son for christmas he uses it everyday loves it i was worried my cheap plastic door frame wouldn't hold this thing up there is some wood involved in the structure though and that's been enough to hold it up so far i am currently lbs and not torquing on it if i was a big dude i would be too nervous to use it solid investment my grandson decided he wanted to build some muscles this summer so we bought him this workout bar it is positioned over his bedroom door i was doubtful about putting it over my door frame afraid it would pull it down but we've had it a couple of months and there's been some pretty big boys using it and my door frame is still up i do like the way it attaches and i wish i could explain it there are no nails or anything to attach to the wall so i can take it down and shut the door in seconds works as intended fits all my door ways in my house using it for past one and half year and still sturdy it's very good only little problem i didn't see any specifications of the wall size anywhere and mine are way big for the bar it really works is amazing perfect thanks in terms of bang for the buck this is one of the best fitness values on the market i'm about lbs and the bar supports me comfortably without any problem it affixes sturdily to most door frames just measure your door before purchasing to ensure it fits it only takes minutes to put together and so far it has made no marks on the wall or door frame i was initially skeptical but the leverage concept behind the design works great pull ups are one of the most under rated exercises to build strength and your physique you truly do not need to do anything more than pull ups pushups squats and sit ups ab work to get in great shape add in cardio and you're set i have not belonged to a gym in years and i think i might be in my best shape since my youth final bit of advice take it slow with pull ups find a simple program that has you building up slowly over time don't be discouraged if you can't do any to start be patient it may take some time there may be some workouts initially where if you squeeze out one or two pull ups that's a victory pull ups are hard but don't give up and stay with it you will be rewarded easy installation works great the best home gym pull up bar no drilling needed all you have to do is setting up this pull up bar on the door frame sturdy build does the job and a great price it doesn't fit every door and it won't work for me the molding above my doors is thick and that's too high it appears this product was designed for smaller molding the top horizontal bar must rest on top of the molding otherwise it won't stay up when you're pulling up on it while a lot of your weight will be redirected into the door frame there's still a downward vector which the molding above the door absorbs the photo demonstrates how the unit hangs and i'm about shy of fitting sigh also this product probably won't work on anything other than flat molding the top bar is only and probably doesn't provide enough offset for decorative moldings which would probably get crushed these size limitations aren't on amazon's web site or in the manual which i read before unpacked the product this is clearly a vendor miss other products from this vendor note a molding size restriction of update vendor contacted me and offered a completely satisfactory solution so i'm boosting my rating customer service matters very well constructed does exactly what you would expect its nice and perfect love it serve the purpose working just fine for me it's useful it gets the job done if you have the right sized door frame i bought it to start getting back in shape i bought this with a pull up assist band and it works amazing easy to set up and locks right in sturdy and easy to assemble it works the way it's suppose to work it's sturdy and works out the muscles well good fast delivery i have used this product for years and i have never been let down nice construction it seems to be better than older versions and since it doesn't have all the extra hand grips it's really portable and easy to store works great easy to put up and take down there is a slight scuffing above the door but i can live with that perfect solid piece of equipment works great functions as advertised my son loves it solid just don't be dumb and do pull ups every day like i did now dealing with strained tendons in forearms but this product is solid and works well it was easy to assemble i feel confident using it but it still removes paint from the three door ways i have tried the portion that comes in contact with moldings seems soft enough but still pulls paint with it when removed it comes with a small book explaining different exercises but doesn't tell the muscles affected by each exercise nice it works only thing wrong is you can't add just it most pull up bars i had came undone this one is sturdy and versatile definitely worth it i love this workout bar it took three minutes to install and didn't leave any holes in the walls very sturdy and strong for being so light easy to put together and works as expected light weight enough to be moved around when needed and material quality feels very durable and solid put it together last night and did a few pull ups and chin ups on it it is very sturdy probably the sturdiest door frame pull up bar i've used hopefully over time it doesn't get as loose as the others only time will tell little flimsier then i anticipated but works well great item perfect for home workouts it does leave some damage on the ceiling plaster but this can be filled in easily also after months of great use some of the padding started tearing off however i use this almost daily with a weighted vest so it's had good mileage i use gloves so not an issue although i just bought this it seems worth every penny only thing i say is a downside is that it doesn't fit in some doorways but other than that its good not so much for beginners to use connect to door frame good price and this is a very flexible and easy move from door to door product one of the cheaper more effective items for a home gym works great i am a female preparing for a navy boot camp i used this workout bar together with the pull ups rubber bands it took me about month to learn how to do pull up one month after i can do pull ups we have large molding new house with upgraded trim it didnt fit but myh nephew lives it at his housr great pc to keep around the house when ya can't make it to the gym was delivered on time and in good condition easy to put together i'm lbs and have used it a few times with no issues been using this for a few weeks now could be a little more solid in it's constructed but it's to be expected for the price hasn't marked up my wall or door yet works well great product but it didn't come with all of the bolts it needed four only came with two i had to go to home depot and get two more bolts works great throw it up when you want and put it away when you're done unlike other big bulky gym equipment doesn't fit over our extra wide door frames but that's not the sellers fault worked perfectly love the ease of install and ways to exercise my wrists hirt during pushups and dumbbells so this was the perfect alternative workout along with treadmill nice looking too can't believe my wife didn't gripe about it since it is near our bedroom great product been using it for several months now easy install and fits over the door frame so far my work out is going well i pull a few times after i wake up and after i come home from work i feel the results thanks ok had this for years and my doorjamb is fine it does creak ominously sometimes if i get too crazy great for working out kinda wonky but you get what you pay for great product so far i have had it for about a week good for a quick workout however it is missing a couple bolts necessary for assembly still working on how to acquire them months i went from being able to to more than pull ups thanks to this simple device youtube videos and assist bands designed for pullups this worked great though i needed to install l shaped brackets to properly support the bar on the door frame i chose to use it on no biggie i highly recommend this easy to install easy to use very easy to assemble i put it on a door fram that i thought would break but i had no other choice the frame did not brake and it's working perfectly seems solidly built it supports my son pound high school football player i have only used this for a few months about times a week i can't attest to any long term damage to doors or anything like that i didn't measure my door frame but pretty sure its standard stuff this thing works and allows me to do pullups at home the one thing missing from my workout occasionally i feel it get a little loose and i just need to tighten the nuts on it for the price even if this thing broke in a year it would be worth it works very well and easy to put together this is a great product sturdy my year old son loves it super efficient product could be a bit better made but for the price cannot complain product is as described and at a fair price the one big problem is that it needs at least or so inches of wall on either side of the doorway to fit properly i didn't notice it before but all of the doorways in my condo are in corners so it doesn't fit anywhere now that i'm aware of this i notice that most doorways in condos apartments are in corners so you really need to check to see if will fit my granddaughter is in gymnastics and needed to improve her upper body strength this is a great product for that she can put it on her bedroom door frame and work on her chin ups and leg lifts it is easy to take off and put away works great for a cheap door pull up bar nice very sturdy and works very well sturdy so to be completely honest this product looks exceptional i didn't get to test it but it does look like a great product i should have checked the product dimensions before buying it because my door frame was actually too thick and high the reason i give it four stars is because you can't necessarily contact the seller and you will be expected to pay shipping to send it back no matter what even if it's defective so i decided to sell mine on ebay to get my full refund back so i guess just make sure the dimensions make sense before purchasing it this is where i personally went wrong does what i expected slight problem in finding a doorway narrow enough high quality and built to not harm the door jamb other similar bars do create wear on your jamb over time i have been using this for a few months and it has not created any wear marks it seems to distribute the weight better simple to use and allows for various hand grips if you are a tall guy remember to take this down after use or you will remember it's there in middle of the night this is definitely one of my favorite amazon purchases great product and you can't beat the price i would buy again it fit my door frames perfectly and feels sturdy e works perfectly great product great product as advertised i was tentative when i saw the tool and bolts that you would be able to tighten them enough but i can confirm it is solid feels secure and assembly is breeze great product did not darken the walls as bad as other reviews we made sure to place the equipment too roughly on the wall i loved the versatility it offers and durability as well had it for months works great i use it for sit ups pull ups push ups and tricep dips very easy construction i've had one before about years ago and i was happy with my purchase again it's nice to have it around makes for great spontaneous workouts i weigh and i never doubt it's sturdiness i also love doing push ups on it simply awesome did what it was suppose to do excellent i use this all the time great cost for such a good product easy to install works great on the arms does what it's suppose to genuine product a not much to say here it's a filter that goes in the fridge to filter our water and ice it's very easy to install just open the small door pull old one out line up two notches inlet and outlet push in and close the door very simple to install don't forget to run gallons of water before use it's just to make sure any lose material runs out and isn't ingested taste like water

water is great for a few months before the next change as advertised good product at a good price no problem push it in you are done so easy works as advertised but i dont know about the replace every mo part since i hardly use the water ice dispenser of the fridge esp during winter months it should have some kind of gauge of how many gallons passed through it and recommend the replacement intervals on second thought forget it it would just cost twice as much this product seems to be hit or miss for my whirlpool wsf c exf sometimes when i install them they make a jackhammer sound and trickle water other times i'll order this filter and it works great it's a fridge filter what more can i say it filter my water and makes the water taste better it s the original one all good great product and very fast delivery just what i needed great price and fit fit perfectly and cheaper than order in ng through the manufacturer's site will order again it last awhile will be ordering again great value works just great easy to install great taste does just as expected providing clean water for drinking and ice cubes it's by whirlpool you can trust it this filter works good it's the factory recommended one for my fridge the water and ice taste great with it it is a little expensive in my opinion change it every months or when my fridge tells me to you can feel the weight difference between the new and old havent used this one yet but know it works well just very expensive i was skeptical about buying the water filter after all the negative reviews but it surprised me my fridge was new and this is the first time i had to change the filter whatever filter was already in the fridge had a terrible plastic taste so i was concerned that it would stay around with the new filter to my big surprise it was much better i only drink spring water and have drank from the filter and liked it it had no after taste or plastic taste anymore i did have some air bubbles following the filter change but it does go away after a little while i made sure to run the water before the first use as directed although i didn't measure the water so was it exactly however many gallons no idea i am very happy with my purchase and will only order this filter for my whirpool fridge thanks i've found that if you buy the knock off brands they do a good job of filtering the water but do not seem to last as long i've had this one for months and just last week i got the filter indicator light come on this one lasted longer than i was expecting will definitely purchase again good product finally got the right one won't be staying on the auto ship as i found a sight that you can buy for the filter was delivered on time easy to install and will last our family about six months water tastes great i have purchased three or four of these and have no complaints perfect fit but a little costly exactly what we needed for our fridge filter at a better price than in store quick and easy water filter change high quality and works very well third time buyer and will continue to buy we received the product as expected serves it purpose good so far so good have been using off brand filters and all were giving me errors when installed so far everydrop has flawlessly worked no drips no errors will stick to this from now on worked like a charm will order again perfect fit and works great just like what i'd been over paying for at lowes quick and speedy delivery and just what i needed keeps my ice from tasting all funky recommend great price my water tastes better with a new filter great filter as this is an original whirlpool product have purchased other brands in the past and the filter kept on leaking so i had to go back to purchasing the name brand exactly as shown and received promptly unfortunately this brand is no longer offered by amazon prime the substitution for everydrop is much more expensive bummer easy to install works great purfect fit great perfect fit and decent price as adverrised fits my double door whirlpool fridge it is the recommended filter for my refrigerator and works great i have used them for a couple of years now works well fits and does the job great we skimped and got an off brand water filter last time around and we could honestly tell this water filter costs far less than the one at bigger box stores but it works very well and we will continue to purchase it good book works well this is the new direct replacement for our new kitchenaide krsc ess side by side fridge when i pulled out the original filter this is the same model of filter that shipped with the new fridge so yes perfect fit and operation and meets the most nsf criteria of all the other filters out there however i'm taking off one star because it's made in taiwan a couple of steps up from china but these really should be manufactured here or in canada always goo til the last drop perfect fit i haven't had an issue yet i once switched to the cheaper models third party company and had nothing but issues with clogging leaking and other such things everydrop i have yet to have any issues whatsoever i highly recommend this product i did a quality water test on the filter and they came back nearly clear great product worth every penny good product will put it on auto delivery fitted my refrigerator exactly perfect as described i'm not sure why some people have given nasty reviews we've been using this product for two years and it works great as soon as the water starts tasting odd we replace the filter and follow the directions works every time and water tastes like water easily installed great item this is the manufacturer's own filter it's hard to not like it or hard to like it i can't decide i feel like i need it because the tap water here tastes like disappointment and old dirt i just hate that the filter is so expensive our other filter also bought new but from target lasted roughly months we were hoping it'd last closer to a year but i guess we drink a lot of water the filter is very expensive but it is good quality it s a water filter and it works i like that it says clearly which it is so it s easy to know what filter you need when it s time to change it out good deal and fits easily filter does an excellent job for the refrigerator did ad expected it s a water filter for my refrigerator good product used to buy the kenmore model for my amana fridge now that we tried this brand my wife and i love it highly recommended perfectly fits my whirlpool refrigeratorm no problems at all works great its' the only filter on amazon that doesn't make our fridge sound like machine gun when dispensing water exactly what was recommended as a replacemet works great and cheaper here than in my local stores factory original flawless operation you can t go wrong when you order the correct part for the job fits perfect and works grear cheaper than lowe s and home depot that s the point right this filter works fine as a replacement for w or w a lots of confusion on model numbers and what fits so i am putting a photo here to help clarify p rfwr w a and edr rxd are all the same fit wise just installed in a maytag msf d xaw so time will tell how well this one performs rather expensive for a filter however price is high but the other knockoffs do not filter as much junk been very happy with this this was the exact same filter that came out of my new refrigerator very easy to replace works well i think we did discover that the fridge works on a timer tells you it needs changing in months no matter how much you use it this one removes so many contaminates this worked great and was easy to change and the water is great it was delivered on time and was what i needed works as advertised good works great and we have a lot of silt in our water thank you fit in my fridge and our water tastes good again i had bought the off brand from hd a couple times and they don't last anywhere near as long as the whirlpool brand i have purchased this whirlpool refrigerator water filter many times it works perfectly and has no down sides great replacement filter thanks for the information to provide us with the correct filter genuine whirlpool filter fit's and works great replaced the old filter and seems to be working as advertised i certainly notice a difference in the taste of ice cubes since replacing this filter the filter fits fine it arrived in good shape same as filter good value delivered what i ordered it exactly what was displayed best deal wise i've found on this expensive item just as described great but seems i now only have this one most expensive option for my refrigerator why so expensive i hope it lasts awhile quick delivery simple fit never can find our size at lowe's or home depot so we buy these good value last long arrived as expected undamaged packaging exactly what i needed for my refirgerator does a great job been using these for quite some time no issues fits both our refrigerators works as expected and fitted perfectly installation was a breeze excellent product at the best price i could find expect to flush out a couple of gallons of water first right after installing it but that s standard for all filters wish it wasn t so expensive the convenience is great though as advertised it makes our city h o taste like bottled water filter works great does the job but pretty expensive i went through about six different water filters from various brands trying to find one that would work for my four year old kenmore refrigerator on my last refill up until that point i had been successful using rd party filters this time there was a change in the design for the filters by all manufacturers each one would fit fine but i could not get any pressure at all just a hammering sound this official whirlpool filter worked right away producing better water flow than i have gotten with any of the other filter manufacturers i didn't notice any difference in the taste of the water the filter was troublesome after the first night and i had to adjust it a few more times before it was just right to keep the water flowing no problems in the month since i knocked one point off since it is a little pricey item as described and arrived on time fits and works would like to see it less expensive or discount on purchase of two or more great product as described and fits well but expensive this has been the best tasting water filter for our fridge but i hate the price i've tried the others and the water just doesn't taste as good i will say that our whirlpool refrigerator has never worked right and has broken in so many places it's ridiculous so i'll be glad to get rid of it when we can already had to throw out the whirlpool dishwasher it was the right part for my refrigerator's water filter and it is soooo easy to install into my unit just like the one from the factory destroyed in hurricane so never used it also fridge very quick delivery and exactly as described exactly what i needed super fast shipping great product and great price fit perfectly and the water tastes great easy to install it fits my whirlpool fridge it lasted about months our water contains a lot of chlorine the tap water smells like bleach and calcium removes the icky odor and flavor of our water so that's worth it the price was a little steep just ordered a pack of another brand this time for just a few bucks more than what i paid for this single one hopefully they'll work just as well and last just as long works great great tasting water water tasted better than had in a long time this product is exactly what the description says it is it was easy to replace my old filter with this one and i'm very happy with this purchase fair price better than ordering from kitchenaid fits like a dream serves its purpose works great and it was delivered within hours i'm tired of trying the rd party parts though expensive water from this one is clean and tasteless came in days and am happy this filter was very easy to install and fit just like the one that came with the refrigerator it seems to do a good job of filtering the water without slowing down the flow too much works perfect easily installed and works well just follow the directions about throwing away the first three gallons of water before use good product water tastes great works great it may be pricey but worth the money our water in fl is awful and this clears up the taste i don't notice any chlorine or chemical taste in my water while using these filters and i can tell the difference once it is time to replace filters a good glass of water works great expensive but worth it for me to buy the factory original part i read reviews on the less expensive ones about them leaking and there's no way i wanted to take that chance with our new laminate hardwood floors keeps the water and ice fresh especially in a house with hard water best tastes and lasts the whole time it should generic may be cheaper but it isn t as good tasting or as long lasting about half as long it's doing a perfect job it cleans water expensive but what i needed easy to install worked right away no problems new filter showed how much it needed to be changed now what can you say about a fridge filter it works and cost too much for a half of year nice product very easy to install and very efficient fits my fridge easy to install clean pure good tasting water refrigerator won t work without it fast delivery easy to install however it took a while for the filter to work because it needed the water to run through for a significant amount of time so for a day our water trickled out the filter was great my refrigerator has the convenience of a water dispenser and making sure it s clean water is priceless making sure that my family has edible water to drink is a high priority for me just what i needed work s great so far i got no problems with it the water feels and tastes better still doing good thank you seems to be working perfectly but said to flush with gallons without any instructions as to how to flush it put it in but didn't know how to flush it one star down not sure it purifies completely water taste is not as good as i would like maybe just the fort lauderdale water only filter that actually makes our water taste fresh and clean we ve tried many other brands and this will be the only one we buy from now on excellent because it is the real oem water filter and not a counterfeit best price i found easy to change excellent water filter with no problems at all perfect fit on whirlpool refrigerators and no problem at all water filter arrived as promised and installed soon after thanks for the fast service it s the perfect fit for the fridge good price good product just what i needed this is the one recommended by the manufacturer works well easy to install and install definitely gives our city water a fresher purer taste good a bit expensive even at reduced price perfect replacement and it's an exact match to what was in the refrigerator when we bought it fits great but run a few pitchers of water through it before drinking it it's cloudy at first but it ends up being fine none works great no issues fit my amana fridge like a glove perfect fit and great price slightly noticeable pressure drop from it's highly rated and popular generic blue filter counterpart found here on amazon however the filtration is much better from this particular filter you get clearer and much better tasting water out of this one it costs more but at least the water is drinkable unlike the other filter floating around here only giving stars because i wish the price could be cheaper than the store its self perfect swap out and decent price exact replacement the filter worked as expected and was easy to install works great with my fridge water tastes great best filter yet works as advertised works fine just wish it was less expensive exactly what i was looking for as advertised quick delivery i can't see any microbes in my water so it must be doing something works great keeps our water fresh and free of yucky stuff perfect lasted about months which is above average for these filters a perfect fit i have bought other off brand filters but they always seem to be a force fit i was always worried i would break the door or the fittings on the frig this one fits like it should with no unnecessary force to install ordered a generic brand water filter for the fridge to cut down on cost big mistake these filters are quite costly very happy with this filter it's the correct size and model and lasting the amount of time it should so far my fridge light is still green which means it's not time to replace yet and it's been mos since i purchased originally this is our rd order and they are always good works for me other than the increase from the previous price this filter is great with no problems i tried a cheaper filter and it leaked so despite the increase i will stick with this one for the foreseeable future had some problems after installation the pressure would drop causing the water dispenser valve to drop in and out little flow pulled the filter out reinstalled after shaking it pretty hard a few times and so far no more issues water still tastes good so i think it still works good we like this last a while we had used a competing product but after a while the other product really slowed the water down from the water side of the refrigerator i read in the manual that this brand was really made for whirlpool and i made the switch and now we have great water pressure worked fine and easy to install i ordered rd party filters before and the water taste was bad these filters solved the problem will purchase these in the future sometimes you really do get what you pay for or not very good experience looks like a great product and packaging just wish it would last longer have not had any problems this is the third time ordering this product easy to install works as it should good product good purchase bought this to replace the original one in my fridge went in easy the only part that i don't love is that you are supposed to cycle gallons of water through it before you can drink it seems like a ton of wasted water so we started putting it in gallons to save in case we lose power and need water to flush the toilet or what not as the old saying goes you get what you pay for i ordered several filters for my kitchenaid whirlpool fridge and all have had some kind of issue this replacement was perfect i had no trouble with it the water comes out great and easy to install in my opinion is worth the price it works as promised and fulfills its purpose product as described did just fine this item works i purchased a different product that was half the price for a two pack but they did not work on my whirlpool side by side fridge freezer all these aftermarket products say they fit and work and have correct part numbers but the in expensive ones do not work on my fridge this one works costs more but it's well worth it update months later this filter is perfect and it's been the only one that works on my whirlpool refrigerator no problems works grest perfect exactly what i needed for the fridge good for the our whirlpool refrigerator yes i am happy with the product bought on subscription so i don't ever forget to change it at the appropriate time follow directions and make sure you run the water till it's clear and your dispenser stops gurgling or sputtering takes about a gallon replacement for another filter ordered from on line the previous one left a chemical taste in the filtered water this one has no such issues it looks pretty and replaces easily how would any consumer know if it filters what it says it does with out specialized measuring devices it is pricey but promises to do the best job the water looks clear and tastes fine the amazon page description as well as the product web site both lead me to order the wrong filter at first return was easy and the right one was sent i really try to read full descriptions and figure out exactly what i am ordering but i usually miss some small detail and end up with the wrong part this time both sites lead me wrong great good second time that i have ordered and used it easy to install and works great perfect fit my daughter has purchased this filter a few times for her refrigerator and is very happy with it the filters are just right for my fridge i have ordered these before and will do again works really great just follow the directions and flush the first gallons through the water dispenser on your fridge should be good tasting and clean water for the next months filters out most everything just what we needed for our kitxhaid side by side refrigerator fits perfectly for our model krsc ess works as advertised fits fast delivery good product good clean water again is it is easy to use wouldn't drink water without it exactly what came with our whirpool refrigerator stick with the manufacturers brand the others are a joke great product and cheaper than purchasing at your local home store works in my whirlpool frig seems to be working fit the fridge perfectly great works as expected and fit the refrigerator with no problems arrived in factory packaging and in good shape great gotta have a water filter just had my water tested and the results were great i guess this filter is doing the job on my refrigerator my frig is a whirlpool and this filter fit fine easy to install excellent product used with my refrigerator i have had no complaints from anyone else in my house about the water taste i think this one does a perfect job in my opinion of providing crisp clean water would buy it again and will have to in another months original part so no muss no fuss was less than local hardware store great price for this product in stores the cross is twice as much will definitely buy from this company again wonderful lived up to expectations love it that's why i've ordered twice perfect fit best quality fair price a lower cost solution compared to the buy in store option great arrived on time when i need it great product always works flawlessly this is a good filter that does a pretty good job making our really crappy san diego water taste acceptable it does not last months for us more like months but i think after my previous experiences with off brand filters i will stick with the legitimate version this is the second time i bought this filter and will buy it again no problems is new but cheap and good price on amazon thanks amazon great price and my water tastes amazing works great work as expected excellent quality it's so cool and so great nice for the price you can buy one for yourself or somebody else maybe price is right and this sweet little filter will do your whirlpool refrigerator right lasts about months or gallons that's a lot of ice out of that stainless steel cooler of wonderment and worth every cent from the drop water filter came in on time and works like a charm great and works perfect taste quality wonderful great filter dropped right in the fridge with no issues i tried an off brand the first time i needed to change out the filter didn't seem to last as long after the amount of use we gave it in our household i read several reviews on the cheaper off brand filters that claim to be a comparable replacement for the original part seems there are many dissatisfied reviewers decided to just stick with the original for a little bit more money from now on works well my water tastes great in houston that's really saying something for the filter excelent product they're not cheap but i've tried other rd party filters and none of them worked right all of the other ones would cause the water dispenser on my whirlpool fridge to hammer knock and only spit out an intermittent stream of water this filter worked great from the get go with no issues in the last month or so that i've had it my wife said she noticed a taste but i haven't noticed a difference beyond different than tap water i've been happy with it just wish they weren't so expensive easy to install water taste good no after taste this is my second one excellent filter good price filters the water and fits as expected does what it's supposed to no complaints works great compared to buying this product at hardware stores amazon com price beat the competition it is exactly the same brand that my refrigerator requires excellent price half of of what home depot and lowes charge works just fine exactly what i ordered easy to install water flows at a slightly quicker rate same water taste i ordered this for the first time over a previous site that was more expensive this arrived on time and was packaged nicely which i appreciate it works great and so easy to install even for a person like me that can mess up hanging a photo up this is the best water filter we have found so far we tried others but they can't compare to this one manufacturer original part works as it should no leaks like some of the off brand compatible filters this is the cheapest that you'll find the real whirlpool everydrop filter was the correct size for the fridge and easy to install in perfect condition and works like a charm delivered promptly excellent price timely delivery and product is excellent cheaper than anywhere else and works fine i have on order for every month this product is great and lasts for months works very well the water taste is great went right into my fridge and works fine wonderful easy to order and install thank you was just like the one i had but less expensive thru amazon more than satisfied very easy to use since i am mechanically challenged i was so glad that all i had to do was line up the arrows and it pops right in it is the best price you ever going to get good price compared to the big box stores in the past i had bought another brand and it leaked all over my my floor perfect fit easy to install great product my whirlpool repairman wanted to sell me one at double the price great product as advertised arrived the next day works fine will probably order the next one the same way fit perfectly in our whirlpool refrigerator worked good water tasted good the best item is as described it fits my whirlpool fridge it's doing an excellent job i'm happy with it fits in my whirlpool fridge as well as the original it fits as i would expect unless i ordered the wrong one it doesn't leak and the water and ice has no funny taste after running about or more large glasses of water through it perfect exact replacement same as the one i always get at home depot just a little lower price exactly what i needed easy to change out product is excellent works great excellent filter was so easy to replace i would recommend highly and will buy again when needed great product great service product came and works as expected as expected this is an excellent water filter though somewhat pricey however they last about months and do an excellent job they are easy to install works likes it's supposed to great product replacement filter for some whirlpool refrigerators super easy to replace and good quality the price seems just a bit high remember to run a few gallons through the dispenser after replacing the filter so you you don't get any air bubbles in your system needed a replacement and for less then what i paid i stores can't beat it product matched is description perfectly works great worked as expected so far so good replacement for our fridge same price as going to home depot saved the trip just as advertised works great reasonable price and it for perfectly fits perfect tastes great love it highly recommend works without issue perfect thanks product was easy to install and my water tastes great less costly alternative expensive filter but water does taste great thanks good for my maytag check your refrigerator first came as described easy installation and our water and ice taste great so far so good my last one clogged up not this brand in less than months never had that problem before this one replaced the clogged one with no problems so far it fit in our fridge and was cheaper than at lowe's still not sure how good a filter it actually is but it is the only one i know of that fits my fridge does what you'd expect no problems just the filter i needed for my refrigerator just what i ordered and needed arrived on time and in great condition easy to install keeps my water dispenser in great shape works great at a much cheaper price than factory filters it fits and the price was better than the box stores new identical copy of one i spent more on at a department store arrived o time perfect fit the product seems beautiful and practical i think it should be pretty good i'll try it in a minute long lasting good tasting water only by authentic the cheap knock offs are total crap this is original filter replacement for my fridge and it works as expected i would not risk my health buying cheaper generic alternatives by far the best brand that we have found we love the fact that you can use your amazon prime it gets here in a matter of days sometimes these will go on sale we stock up because we have had really good results from this filter it is true to time meaning i have wrote the dates of the day we replace the filter on the filter itself and each one has lasted us exactly months we use it a lot it is our main source of water in the house because we are iffy about consuming the tap water great purchase you can truly taste the difference it makes it's a water filter and it works enouigh said it's a water filter it's easy to replace into it's spot and i immediately had clear and nice tasting water just ran one gallon through the new one to be cautious i don't know if this just works with our whirlpool fridge but it's a lifesaver in a town where the tap water is as hard as ours it works well and it usually lasts close to months though the flow slows down and doesn't do much as a filter if we don't change it in time i've had no reason to look for any other product it works just fine on our year old fridge didnt fit issued refund they work well and have a good fit this has worked great for us not sure what issues caused some of the negative reviews but i'm on my th one and they have all been great i subscribe and get a new one every couple months it takes seconds to swap the filter out and we have had absolutely no issues with smell or taste or quality cheaper than purchasing at home depot definetly recommend it at least i don't have to drink flint's water works but expensive great item great filter does an excellent job at purifying the water tastes great too i replace around every months works awesome it work good perfect fit at a great price exact replacement at a great price good fit easy to install can't vouch as to it's effectiveness but me and the old lady are still alive so i guess it can't be that bad i installed this on my whirlpool refrigerator installation was very easy just open the filter door on the fridge the old filter pops out pull the old filter out and insert new filter close filter door then flush gallons through get rid of any trapped air months lifespan is probably conservative unless you drink a ton of water i plan on keeping for at least a year before replacing price was better on amazon than home depot reasonable price factory standard quality and fast delivery delivery is fast i'm satisfied i will buy again later yes works much better than those knock offs works great worked great this everydrop water filter as usual works great on our whirlpool refrigerator it is easy to install and make our water in clayton county ga the worst in the area drinkable as good as if i were ordering from whirlpool outlet you have my business fits right in fridge does the job to filter the water will buy again update i am revising my review because i was incorrect with my conclusions i finally got a technician to look at my problem and he said that it something he has seen before and it is air in the water line his only advice was to keep working at it until the air is gone i gave up after a while and just removed the fiter entirely my model fridge does not require a plug i'm somewhat annoyed with whirlpool support i can't be the only person to have had this problem i've tried four different filters with no success with three of the filters there was a loud hammering sound that persisted and sounded like it could damage the fridge with this last purchase there is a brief hammering noice then no water comes out of the dispenser just a drop or two no matter how long i try when i put the old filter back in the water flows with no problem unfortunately i let the return window close so i am stuck with it i should add that i chatted with whirlpool support apparently they have no history of this sort of problem their suggestion was to try another filter which i did and if that didn't work it didn't place a service call they also recommended that i check if my model fridge is still eligible for their service plan if i place a one time service call for this problem then i become ineligible for their service plan either way it sounds expensive i am at a loss as to how to get a replacement filter has anyone had luck with off brand non whirlpool filters great came on time and exactly as described works good and water taste fresh great quick to install i've bought this a few times to replace in my fridge make sure you run a bunch of gallons of water through the filter per the instructions before drinking it works just right and the water tastes great this was the first filter change for our new refrigerator used the official whirlpool filter based on feedback that cheaper versions leaked and caused problems also liked the fact that this one removes so many contaminates this worked great and was easy to change and the water is great just what i needed great service and product the filter arrived promptly and fit properly ran the required amount of water through the filter and all is well fits well does what is supposed to do before if i filled a waterbottle with water and finished it then left it there for a few days i'd smell it and it'd smell like mildew now it doesn't do that so its great might as well get the pack cause you know you will be using both of them exactly as advertised excellent product try to go with an off brand that didn't work as expected somehow my water tastes better than with previous filters the product was delivered as expected and is as per description this is meant to replace the earlier model by pur see photos attached after replacing during first one or two quarts there may be name sound as the water gets inside the filter which seems normal and goes away immediately after the instruction says to throw way first gallons of water after replacing it's a filter it makes water not taste like it has been filtered through used steel wool i recommend it perfect fit received very quickly snapped right in just what i wanted fits like a glove on time perfect thanks they work well and cost me less than the lowes wanted plus they were out of 's fast shipping and product match not too difficult to change out was an exact fit and match for my maytag this product fits perfectly in my fridge i was a little nervous ordering online but it came quickly and i was able to have it out of the package and in the fridge within minutes thank you good product easy installation excellent part the only disadvantage is the price installation was easy only reason for stars is price works fine thanks worked perfectly make sure to order the correct version of this filter for your fridge ask me how i know previously i bought a discount filter for much less than this everydrop but it wasn't worth it as the charcoal leaked out of the canister and into the filtered water i had bought a three pack and every one of the filters was defective i've had no trouble whatsoever with this everydrop and since there's only two of us i've reset the filter without changing it a couple of times and it was still satisfactory works great i'm only buying oem filters from now on as i've had mixed results with some of the lesser known brands i e when you see type o's and or spelling errors on product labels it starts to make me suspicious about how much attention to detail these 'other' filter makers have towards assuring my water is pure and clean especially for my kids love it does the job awesome best price i've found for this thus far the water is crisp and taste amazing the delivery was quick and it works as designed and promoted will reorder more when the time comes it's be exact same thing at the store arrived in a few days from ordering it pullled out old filter pushed this one right in that simple works great i purchased this for my neighbor and she was thrilled to save over the cost at lowe's this filter works great for me and a lot better priced than getting in the store we live out in the country and only use ice from the fridge taste is much better since replacing cheaper here than same thing through the website of whirlpool delivered on time and works fine perfect just as advertised cheaper than ordering from the manufacturer great get the real deal and pay the price i have tried other sellers and the filters have leaked and created floods in my refrigerator this is the real deal and works great think do you trust aftermarket filters with your drinking water and your health maybe the price is higher but the reward is great tasting clean water you can trust and not some aftermarket filter from a third world source everydrop filters work very well price and quality were as promised will order replacements just what i needed for appearances and function just as advertised none works fine very nice product had a problem finding first replacement cartridge for a new fridge when i finally received this one i was very pleased plan to buy quantity for future use easy to install good item good delivery it's a water filter what more can one say it does filter our water beautifully and clearly as one would expect this is the third filter i have ordered and replaced for my refrigerator i like the product and have been happy with the water i cannot tell the difference of the quality of water but fortunately i have a very sensitive kitty who does not drink water that smells her favorite water is the one from my refrigerator installed with this drop filter many people don't think about replacing the water filter in their fridge but get water and ice all the time from the door replace your filter now when whirlpool decided to switch from the pur branded filters the the everydrop brand there were some definite variations in quality during the transition i had brought a two pack at that time and while the first filter was fine the second introduced an awful plastic taste into the water that would not go away these newer ones as of seem to be much better they have no plastic taste and work well albeit a bit expensive note that the latest package revision includes a holographic genuine logo on the filter excellent product and service the filter worked as advertised the delivery was on time and the packaging was fine i would buy again easy to install and follow directions no problem cartridge for new refrigerator we own a whirlpool and this fit the model two seconds to install don't forget to run it a while before drinking i bought this for my whirlpool fridge i live in an area where the water quality isn't good i had absolutely no trouble installing this product and after running water through it about gallons the water was clear and tasted great i had no problems with it clogging at all i installed a whole house water filter on my house and i find it has prolonged the life of my fridge filter i don't have to buy bottled water any more good product fast delivery just as described good price received as expected great filter water tastes great this lasts a long time installed it a few days ago and it works perfectly an expense you can't get rid of fast delivery got exactly what i asked for works great this filter is a perfect fit for my kenmore fridge and it cost me nearly half the price that i used to pay at the store at first i saw a mix of reviews i decide to go with it anyway so far so good this is the second time i ve buy this filter and it works fine the water taste good if fit perfectly on the fridge and i sued for about months before i need to replace it regarding the taste like i said i had no issues what so ever i did follow the instructions from the fridge manufacturer where it s says that when using installing a new filter i need to let the water follow for certain amount of time it s like dropping like a gallon and half before start using it again i had no issues with the taste or any other noises on the fridge pricey but does the job and it's the one our frig needs our previous one lasted about months the only con is its price and the fact that it only filters around gallons a big family goes through one of these pretty quickly fits perfectly great product fits as expected the product and price is right i have only installed this and had it one day but what can i say it's a water filter it does exactly what it is supposed to do i'm pretty sure all the people complaining about the taste and the water being foggy don't follow directions you have to flush a lot of water through first gallons the water only looks foggy because a filter is hundreds of thousand porous holes squeezing water through and that's how it's filtered so for the first few days you are getting all those little bubbles from the porous holes it goes away after a couple of days tastes good perfect fit delivered quickly these things cost too much imho but that is the same everywhere it is just what i want and arrived just when i needed it thank you so much perfect i absolutely love the way the arms fold over the backs of the arms do not touch the lenses like all the other similar glasses i've owned they are also very comfortable on my face i will purchase another backup pair so if i lose this pare i won't be waiting a couple days for my new ones to arrive these things are awesome i know they say watching tv before bad actually hinders sleep but i like to do it anyway i did notice that as i've gotten older though the tv really does increase the time it takes me to fall asleep i could be tossing and turning for up to an hour you'd think i'd stop watching tv before bed but nope i happen to be reading some random blog one day and saw the writer recommend these glasses for those who watch tv or use their cell phones at night i figured for what was there to lose i noticed a difference on the very first night i was falling asleep minutes into my show which never happened i can't even tell you the amount of times i've fallen asleep with these glasses on that's how comfortable they are they are flexible and appear to be made with soft rubber that bend with the shape of your head if i fall asleep i don't feel a hard piece of plastic sticking into my skin it's almost as comfortable as a sleep mask but also very durable they're in the same shape they were when i bought them two years ago i would highly recommend for anyone who uses a computer cell phone or watches tv or any other electronic device at night rated very highly for blocking blue light arms are easily adjustable wrap around style offers maximum protection they are very yellow giving a strong color to any tablet or phone screen i bought three pairs of these they are affordable and make such a difference for me i wear them all day at work while i stare at a computer screen and i wear them while driving at night the glasses help with my eyestrain and migraines so much i have not liked other brands as much others have been sunglasses too and are too dark or they are more trendy looking and not strong enough i also get lots of compliments on these people think they are a fashion statement or more rarely they know about blue light eyestrain the safety glasses help with changing the tint of my vision when i wear it using my tablet they are ridiculously bulky but they do the work my eyes are no longer tired from staring at a computer screen they adjust easily for the price these are just fine i'm not going to win any fashion contests with them on but who cares i was hoping to put these over my other glasses but it doesn't fix over them i can use it in my car to see better and at night on my computer so i can sleep better it wraps around which helps and works awesome i am glad i got these glasses i have a hard time falling asleep at night so i bought these to block the blue light when on my computer at night i found them on a consumer reports site that actually tested the amount of light blocked and these were the clear winner the only downside is they're not very stylish however that's usually not the point when buying glasses like this interesting bigger than expected tough to use with cpap good for my eye watching pc for long periods of time they really block the blue lights very good for night readings i was hoping to put these over my other glasses but i find it is too curved to allow that otherwise i think they are really nice for the money i bought these to help me with my pregnancy i kept getting such bad headaches from looking at my phone computer recently obviously i have a job where i have to be at the computer phone all the time i look super cool obviously lol but no more headaches which was the main reason why i bought them oh obviously it changes the color of your backgrounds but again worth it for no headaches these work but i forget to use them i think i need to keep them out and nearby the tv that's my problem great for driving but you must get use to the color shift really good for protecting my eyes from the light from my phone at night before going to bed leaves a mark on my nose works well to adjust the blue light on my tv fit the need a bit too big for my face and head but they do work in reducing the eye strain and fatigue from staring at my computer for too long sucks when working with art programs like sai though because it skews the colors for reading and researching perfect significantly reduces eye strain when programming for hrs day blue blocked as expected stopping blue light at night is well advised for the best nights rest these glasses are cheap and work i go to bed early and needed help sleeping with this odd sleep schedule this product helps i try to put these on before i go to bed or when i go to bed either way i use them before i plan to crash the only odd part is the lack of the color blue i am a gamer so the missing color makes gaming more interesting when watching tv the missing color isn't too bad just a bit odd i just remind myself this is helping me sleep in a few minutes and to suck it up bottom line i believe this works so i recommend for those having difficulty sleeping just remember to start early read the other reviews for this product as i did to educate yourself on how this works too it is helpful to know how and why it works i knew that even blue led was enough to disrupt melatonin secretion and sleep many years ago i had tried blue light dimming software and while it is much better now there are still other sources of blue light from fluorescent lights and more and these are great although really annoying that they made the direct from amazon prime only this has prevented friends who i suggested to from ordering they did not see available from other sellers not requiring prime the new prime only thing for amazon is my only complaint blocks the blue wait till you use them on test circles you'll run into shopping about this subject they don't fit over glasses but nice fit on your head sides are nice and keep blue light out use them around the house and driving they are quite confortable and i really feel starting to get sleepy once i put them on in the evening only drawback maybe they could come with a suited case work well they re made way better than any other safety glasses i ve bought they have a good range of adjustability which helps for various uses they re a little cumbersome to fit under a hat or ear protection but still quite adjustable honestly i knocked a star off because they re just so ugly it s a vapid reason to rate it less than perfect i looked directly at a blue led light and couldn't see any blue now that's value fantastic for migraines these are the perfect blue light blockers cheap and effective not like gunnar or pixel that cost ten times more but block less than half the blue light works well if you don't need to wear reading glasses to see the screen i love these glasses for using while on the computer they make a huge difference for me to read letters much better clearer images i also have a problem staying awake at the computer and i believe these glasses help with that too seems odd but i do try a pair at this great price i don't think you'll regret it love it feel like miles baby or dizzy on the riviera mellow yellow i use these at night when i'm reading my ipad in bed even with the night setting on the ipad i like how these block the blue light from it and my phone when reading they really helped wirh reducing my migraine headaches they don't fit well i notice a slight difference in magnification around the middle fit good works good for certain eye straining activities its works fine its not the coolest desing you can use it with glasses if they are not to big but it was not designed for it i've been using these to help lighten up the dark cloudy days with a hint of sunshin and protect my eyes from monitor glare they are well made and the frame adjusts to your ears distance for comfort item as described works great these fit great and are a great price i can even fit them over my regular glasses they work i had been having an impossible time going to sleep for the last year and figured it was caused by aging during that year though my evening habits had become more more spending time on the computer now i always wear the glasses if i'm on my phone or computer after pm and i have no problem going to sleep or staying asleep thank youuu uvex works as described to reduce the blue light while dorky as hell these glasses block out all the blue light just like i needed them to it's like i'm living on mars i use these to watch tv at night to reduce the blue light and it works great very very helpful my husband makes fun of me when i wear these but they're worth the teasing they really block out the annoying blue light helped me sleep better i highly recommend them glasses are great i am using them every night if watching tv and i am sleeping better really block the blue light and according to comparisons of blue light blocking glasses these are the best at blocking and the cheapest so glad i researched first to find these really help a lot great glasses for blocking blue light bought others but they didnt work these arent srylish to wear in public or office setting but they do work fits well i was pleased with the fit i use these to watch tv at night to block the blue light the color takes a bit getting used to but these are great decent for the price my and year old wear these they work great apparently of blue is blocked and i believe it and they are an exceptional price i bought pairs for family i notice a reduction in eye fatigue after a long day and evening on the computer very helpful have been having trouble sleeping due to too much blue light exposure not when i use these i go to bed earlier and sleep better through the night i bought for me and for my wife they passed all tests i could find on the web to filter out blue lights and both of us noticed immediately that it truly help us sleep much better we now use it everyday after sunset when reading computer monitor smartphone tv nice fit really helps with eye strain while reading a computer monitor in an industrial setting the glasses are well made they make you feel good because they block a lot of color entering your vision it is all bright you also see when car truck or bus has done a paint job funny in a lot of ways i enjoy these glasses i'm sleeping better now that i put these on at least an hour before bed i admit i'm a computer junkie and with a limited amount of free time to use my computer i work and play right up to bedtime these glasses really help the fit is expectedly generic but fit well enough to ignore works great to block blue light however they don't fit my head well great deal for anti blue light glasses and they wrap around and can be word over existing glasses depending on yoiur frames my office mates laughed at me for wearing these but they make all the difference when you're staring at a computer screen all day i usually put them on the last half of my shift and my eyes rarely hurt after work definitely worth the money very comfortable seem to be effective awesome glasses they fit perfectly they block blue light completely even from the sides definitely worth the price great buy good price and great product i use these everyday at work because i sit i front of a computer for hours keeps my eyes from burning or getting irritated and makes the screen easier to look at i've noticed it also helps my attention to detail if you work in front of computers all day then you should really buy these seems to work need to be a few clicks longer on the ear pices and they wold be a star wearing these at night after pm helps me get to sleep colleagues joke with me and i don't care my sleep is better when i wear these or stay off my computer and other devices at least hours prior to bed these glasses passed the test very effective as advertised wish the company made clip ons these have been incredibly helpful in reseting my circadian rhythm i fall asleep faster sleep deeper work great tested them with a blue led light total blockage all others i've tested show a weaker blue light coming through but these are the best quick delivery from seller if you want more reasons to use them read book by matthew walker why we sleep chapter excellent amber color safety glasses for viewing computer screen at night to prevent alertness from its blue colors also great for outdoor use serving as the best color of sunglasses amber that blocks the blue rays from the sun that hurt our eyesight very relaxing for my eyes i can stare at computer and not get pressure headaches i got these glasses for my grandchildren they spend a lot of time on the computer and i'm afraid of the cumulative damage of computer use tv watching tablet use and whatever other blue light producing products they engage in if i can cut down on some of the blue light damage this is a cost effective and practical way to do it it fits my year old grandson perfectly but is a bit loose on the year old who still uses it because it looks cool they have no graduation for me i've been using another blue light set of glasses that has the graduation i need for my vision on computer screens my ophthalmologist told me it was a great idea and he highly recommended the protection basically you figure the graduation you may need by ordering a level that is half your reading glasses strength so since my reading glasses are i halved it and got the which works perfectly does it affect colors yes especially the first few minutes after that you forget they're there if you use your computer for processing photos or designing graphics etc you might need to occasionally lift the glasses up to make sure you're not over yellowing but for video watching computer games and office documents word excel etc it really doesn't interfere takes some getting used to the jury is still out works it blocks of uv light tested by consumer reports i'm suffering from eye strain red eyes tearing light and brightness sensitivity from computer screens these felt very soothing to my eyes from day blocks blue light very well the design and fit is very comfortable shape of glasses contours around my face and the side blocks side light also very comfortable i don't notice the amber color on the nd day of wearing these and i have to say my eyes are loving these glasses definitely block out of blue light most glasses only do they fit well and are adjustable that said you look really really stupid wearing them they are ugly but they get the job done wore them before bed and was definitely more tired after an hour wearing them my eyes the goggles do something these things definitely seem to block out the blue no problem so far don't play color based puzzle games though now these actually block blue light which you can test online i wasted my money on another pair first that turned out to be useless then found these in a consumer report rating blue light blocking glasses they work they pass the online tests and really do block blue light these glasses work very well use these daily these glasses have made a huge difference in my sleep at night i can work on my computer all evening long wearing these glasses and then go to bed and sleep soundly all night great for everything tv computer and sun and sunlamp these work great and blocks out the blue light as stated i use them for late night tv watching and have no complaints these were recommended to me so i thought i'd give them a shot they actually fit my small face pretty well i'm asian and have a flatter nose i was expecting it to be way too large but they are okay they do slide down off my face a bit but i guess i could place a shim on the bottom of the lenses where it touches my face to help keep them up or use some sort of tie to fasten it to my head i wear this hours before i go to sleep it's been only a week so i don't notice a measurable difference i'm still getting used to watching a movie without any blues and brushing my teeth with these googles on after two hours i'm glad to be able to take them off mostly because they are large and i'm just not used to them i use a computer for hours but i would not use these to play video games or on the computer try blue blocking glasses that aren't as yellow you'll still get some benefit and not blow out all the blues i'm glad i tried this product it was a good price and is not a big investment to see if using them can help me sleep better and more sound as far as blue blocking these are the best glasses by far of the many i've tried in the low to moderate price range in an online two image comparison graphic for testing the effectiveness of blue blocking lenses both images appear identical when i'm wearing the glasses they are very comfortable on my small woman's head have adjustable temples and fit very close to my face all the way around the nose bridge on these glasses is molded into the lens and is not quite as comfortable as smith wesson magnum g glasses which have a silicone nose piece but it does interfere less with vision the lenses wrap around giving good side protection from blue light these are very nice inexpensive blue blockers i wish uvex made an over prescription glasses model with the sct orange lens that would be perfect couldn't be happier i performed two online blue light tests on these glasses they passed both the first picture is what the screen looks like without glasses the second picture is of these uvex glasses that passed the test and the third picture is of gammaray glasses that didn't pass i bought these used off amazon and they were sent new looking burns my eyes to look at the screen after i take these glasses off never knew what i was missing for the price they are well worth it great glasses arrived early well worth the money good fit i put my glasses over them do a good job for a cheap pair of blue blockers great starting point great glasses and do what they were promised to do cut eye fatigue well worth the price these work great really softening lighting in the evening which is why i bought them definate help in sleep prep these are the bomb i'm truly falling asleep soooo much faster if i wear these while i use electronics before bed still shouldn't do it but these really help my eyes feel less strain when i use at night for computer work or watching tv made well works perfectly great quality for me block it does in fact it blocks so much i can't see any other color than yellow however if the point is to lessen eye strain than this absolutely does that it looks exactly like a pair of shop glasses though which maybe it is anyways it works works great they ve made a noticeable difference for me when i wear them a few hours before bed i find i m not only sleeping longer but more soundly i highly recommend for the price they can't be beaten does as expected and helps me sleep when i put them on a few hours before bed look like a dork but protect your eyes i think that's an okay trade off i work under led lights all day and i would go home bloodshot regularly these glasses prevented coworkers thinking i was getting high on the clock others compliment me on how much they like the glasses but i have to wonder if it's an underhanded insult like regina george from mean girls great tested blue spectrum blockers at a great price work very well at blocking nighttime blue light from all devices i can wear them over glasses but the goggles that uvex makes are better at this i have both kinds love these use them an hour to before going to bed works so well my husband and i both wear them very good blue blockers fit very well and they are adjustable to fit your face they are a little tight to wear over eyeglasses but it will work very similar to what the dentist wears for curing fillings i use the to block blue light before bedtime good color blocking i got these to help with getting to sleep since all our house lighting is now slanted toward the blue spectrum however the lens curve seems to affect my reading distance normally i can read books without reading glasses but i seem to need them with the goggles haven't yet figured out how to put on reading glasses underneath smooth transaction fast shipping item as described thank you worked fine a bit yellow but did the job slips easily over my small light weight glasses the color is great for blocking the blue light absorption e the true colors in the world are distorted so it's hard to see a the stop light colors everyone needs this after trying for it for awhile i am satisfy with the product it seem my eye don't get tired after watching tv or computer for extended of time ridiculous looking glasses that are excellent for blocking blue light decently comfortable i use these at night on my computer over my glasses excellent product it works really well i am getting a better sleep and i am glad to protect against artificial light however for my face they are a little big but i still use them coz they work as i wanted to love it these glasses work better than it competitors according to consumer reports well made and the ear piece can be adjusted for larger faces very pleased with these research all the things that blue light blockers help with it may improve your health does what they say they do my friend's optometrist a professor at uc irvine recommended these uvex glasses and they work fine for my purposes another friend of mine paid three times as much for a pair from england that are also good i don't know the brand name i wear my reading glasses over these when i need to work on the computer before going to bed wearing two pairs of glasses at the same time feels a bit strange but these glasses definitely block the blue back light so it no longer keeps me awake yay my husband really likes these glasses he says they work as expected i like it but clumsy these really do block out all blue and it's very noticeable you have to see if for yourself even people i tell to try it out are amazed how well it cancels out the blue light i usually put these on at night a few hours before bed or whenever i feel my eyes getting tired or strained while watching television they really help you look weird and my family always makes fun and cracks jokes lol but mannn the relief and soothing feeling you get while wearing them and not feeling any strain and your eyes feeling relaxed is sooo worth it plus i've noticed better sleep on the days i actually do wear them right before bed versus the days that i don't i really thought that would be bs the first time i read about it but i do notice it it works well but a tag bulky it slips off my face i also install the software onto my computer and phone in addition to this i use these glasses especially at night when doing computer work they feel like they really protect my eyes from the computer monitor just as expected fit is comfortable and they seem to be improving my sleep quality if i put them on hours before bedtime wish i could get my husband to wear a pair before bedtime too i feel like a nerd when i wear these even at home but the offset is that i have better eyes and a better body as i don't absorb those unnatural light waves permeating through the computer screen bought three of them one for my two computers and one for tv great for late night pc work helps to fall asleep afterwards blocks all blue light i'm actually really surprised with these i bought them for wearing at night so my sleep schedule doesn't get messed up and also for wearing while i'm reading textbooks on my computer i was very hesitant to buy these because i thought they would be too dark they're not at all like sunglasses however i can wear them with minimal lighting inside the house at night and not stumble over anything it seems as though they really do block only the blue light leaving all the other light pretty much alone so you can still see yes everything will have an orange tint but i was able to quickly adjust to it i feel like it actually improves contrast in some cases reading black text on a yellow ish background from a computer screen is actually easier because my eyes don't strain from the uncomfortable blue light highly recommend my sleep has improved greatly since i have started using these glasses after dinner however they do not fit well over glasses if you wear them without glasses they fit so snugly to the face that they fog up then they must be removed and cleaned while you keep your eyes shut so that you do not get a dose of melatonin blocking blue light these goggles ease the tension on my eyes when looking at a computer screen nice they fit over my reading glasses i feel a relaxation as soon as i put them on you can barely see blue light at all with these when you look at a blue light you can barely tell it's on i bought to watch tv in bed at night and protect eyes from t v glare idea is it makes falling asleep easier i'm pleasantly surprised that i do feel more relaxed a good idea these glasses really work i use my computer for long hours and i didn't exactly know why i had a hard time falling asleep then i happen to know about these glasses and since the first night i started yawning while i do my computer on my bed and i was able to fall asleep within min that is amazing i highly recommend these glasses to young children who use computer games like my son does these are great they were to big for the longest time until my husband figured out they are adjustable duh i bought these for my year old son and he loves them and says they look cool and wears them away from the computer sometimes lol i work it and at the eye strain was getting to me i had to do something so i started wearing these they do help out a lot i don't have a headache after hours got it for my husband to use when using the sad lights he likes it fits very well over my rx glasses provides great filtering of the blue light from tv i often have to do computer work up to bed i hands down fall asleep when if i use these the last hour i do work vs if i don t i bought these for my family and everyone loved them they make great gifts the first time i put these on my laptop screen appeared to be close to a warm night shift setting however my ophthalmologist continues to express concern about the open question of how blue light might impact eye health macular degeneration so i play it safe i use my laptop a lot at night so i decided not to totally depend on night shift i looked for glasses that had been tested and chose these after reading a few reviews there was a short learning curve to get used to the tint but really no more than getting used to night shift use for tv watching and computer work blocks light rays that interfere with sleep so glad i purchased look nice seem to block the blue better than others low price but frames are poorly designed due to a manufacturing defect thus poor quality control i had to do some surgery on the frames to get them to fit if you have a very small head you may do better than i did frames appear prone to breakage as advertised these really do make me sleepy when i wear them close to bedtime watching tv or working on my laptop they actually are large enough to fit over my glasses work great these definitely block out blue light i can't wear them to work all the time because i'm a graphic designer and i need to see colors but i am keeping them because i do tend to work at night on the computer or play games on my phone and these help with blocking out that light that tricks your brain into thinking it's daytime apparently so yeah keeping because i can use all the help i can get with getting a good night's sleep cost at only they are a great investment i started to wear these about a month ago after researching some sleep studies i found one to be implemented by a college football team to help their players improve their sleep repeating their process i put these glasses on about hour before going to bed i continue to watch tv and interact with the family in the house one hour later i turn off everything remove the glass and fall asleep within minutes previously i would be awake another minutes before falling asleep after weeks i found myself staying asleep for longer periods of time previously i was waking up x a night just recently i started to remove caffeine and sugar after pm this helped even more placebo not sure but i know my eyes are no longer burning during the day i am falling asleep faster within minutes and out of the past days i may wake up once in the middle of two different nights and not wake up until the morning for the other nights i have since bought these for my spouse and mother in law a pari bought after reading consumer reports article that it blocks blue light the best of all products tested they were right perfect for watching movies at night or to work on pc beware it makes the screen orange though not a problem for me it works a little bulky but on the other hand u can put it on top of another glasses as promised not sure if it works as it is supposed to since night owl husband doesn't tell me i use these to get into rem sleep cycles at night they are amazing i can certainly tell a difference when i don't wear them with my sleep these were the highest rated in both blue light blocking efficiency and overall satisfaction i am using them for all my tv viewing within hours to bedtime i am far sighted so i have apps for my devices very nice for the price works great blocks more blue light than expensive competitors could we get different frame options for these lenses please i am an animator and spend about hours in front of a computer screen every day for work i would highly recommend these if you work in front of a computer all day they are affordable unlike other brands that are out there and they have been working well enough for me been using these for about weeks now and no headaches have come up so far throw these on mins before getting to bed and you will fall right to sleep i sleep better when i remember to wear these in the evening i use it to relax my eyes when i watch tv at night it really works for me i m trying to wear them in the evenings to watch a little tv before going to bed it seems to make my eyes less painful i have just finished chemo treatments for breast cancer and i need to make myself feel as comfortable as possible i think these glasses are helping i use these at home before bed i honestly have seen a huge difference in my ability to fall asleep great for filtering out blue light that keeps you awake at night the lenses are great but the clip on mechanism is not very robust it broke off the glasses the first time i tried them on and i glued them back on with super glue also the grip supplied by the clip on device is weak that being said i am able to live with the deficiencies as the lenses do what they promise to do these are not the most stylish but i only wear them in the house and they work well i notice my eyes are not as strained when i wear them while on the computer tablet or watching the tv they do tint whatever i am viewing but i got use to that after a couple of days i really notice the brightness of screens now it i don't put them on while slightly bulky these have done the job well for me i will be buying them again if this pair should break they work well does a great job and comfortable i have sensitive eyes to light and these are very helpful for watching tv in the evening work well definitely prevents eye strain from blue light or inferior screen quality resolution glare etc however don t think you can just stair at will for hours without some any impact these glasses are a life saver i work under fluorescent lights all day and these glasses truly block out the bad light and flicker best glasses especially for the price i would highly recommend for anyone not using glasses they don't fit very well over my glasses and i like to read while i use it still it is a very good product these work great but are not very comfortable if you have a small face blocks just about of blue light i can't even see the blue lights on my backlit keyboard with these on i got these when i started working third shift i often had sleep issues before that anyway due to using my phone and or computer right before bed but once i started putting these on an hour before bed i slept significantly better even when bedtime was am sure they ugly and they make your world so orange you'll think you walked into a scene from deus ex human revolution but that's ok they work and they work well highly recommended they are big enough to cover your eyes completely and will be good both for computer glasses and for blue blockers good price too really like these glasses they definitely help me to get to sleep quicker i put them on about an hour before bed and they work well very good glasses for blocking blue light however i should have bought the ones that fit over glasses as i wear them at night after taking out contacts still like them good quality i have mild cateracts and these glasses are great for night driving great for calming the eyes and helping me to sleep better helps reduce eyestrain after long hours at the computer studying be sure to keep your eyes functioning and get you a pair absolutely do what they claim i'm super sensitive to screens and blue lights they ruin my sleep with these glasses i can watch tv or a movie at night and still sleep would give them five stars if they had some silicone or something on the nose piece to keep them from sliding down my nose when i look down i've created a hack for this by taking a small amount of silicone putty from my ear plugs and sticking it on the nose piece it works otherwise great glasses they wrap around the sides and block light effectively and the price is fabulous love it how it feels does exactly what it is supposed to and the cheapest one i have seen does what it says i guess more comfortable than the more comfortable than the uvex s x ultra spec safety eyewear i can use these while watching tv in bed they are a bit difficult to wear if you already have glasses i made it work just looked ridiculous they do help with eye strain though i work in an office at computer all day with florescent lighting i like that it's adjustable so that it fits perfectly it definitely blocks the blue yet allows me to see everything on the screen able to use these over my reading glasses to block out blue light when using my computer at night two hours or less before bedtime they do help tone down brightness of computor screen delivery was super fast adjustable ear piece is helpful blocks blue light these really work my eyes were getting fatigued and tired when working for more than an hour on the computer also the blue spectrum light when i did computer work at night was stimulating my brain and causing insomnia these do a great job of allowing me to work on the computer much longer and at night without negative repercussions due to problems above and beyond computer use with being sensitive to glare and to night blindness i also take macuguard supplements and can c eye drops the combination of these three things have probably saved me from having severe eye problems as i seemed to be heading that direction nice bonus these tinted plastic lens glasses are quite inexpensive the glasses cover most of my vision so all the blue light is blocked the glasses are light and fit me perfectly the glasses do their job as promised very good item for the eyes being on my computer a long time this really helps these actually filter out the blue wonderful item to have and use at bedtime to make going to sleep fast very easy check the reviews and see for your self that these actually do the job well really helps my insomnia good item comfortable and blocks all the blue light i use my computer at least hours a day they're cheap so they're definitely worth trying out comfortable even with my headset over them and they really work i can fall asleep easy in around minutes even with my anxiety issues would buy again if i accidentally break them or a friend wants a pair these filtering glasses were favorably rated by consumer reports and represent an exceptional and surprising value as compared to similar models sold at much higher prices the blue light blockage is so effective that one may miss the seeing the fuller color spectrum when viewing certain movies or television programs but they are ideal for pre bedtime viewing as they do seem to reduce the wakening effects of blue light present in computer and television screens excellent just as described and useful hey it protects my eyes but everything is also orange come on technology but then again you get what you pay for here it's also really uncomfortable on my nose no bueno but again it serves its purpose and you get what you pay for here exactly as described blocks light from all sides they're good but just be aware it's very orange i guess that's what they're designed to do almost like orange tinted ski goggles but they give a very good clear panoramic view work really well for filtering blue light i use them at home and bought a more glasses style for the office these definitely work better than the other ones because of the darker lenses they're nice at the shooting range too my favorite product of this has changed my life and given the horrible health impacts of no sleep it may have just saved my life how often can you say that about a product i've suffered with insomnia for years i couldn't get to sleep easily and once i did i couldn't stay asleep i tried melatonin sleeping pills meditation supplements etc nothing worked i had just about given up when i read an article about success in blocking blue light in the hours before bedtime i took a chance and bought these which were featured in the article and wow it sounds crazy but these glasses have changed my life the first night i wore them i slept like a baby after nights of great sleep i tested the product by not wearing the glasses and back to the insomnia so now i've set an alarm on my phone to remind me to put them on at p every night by p i'm falling asleep whether i want to or not i've even woken up in the glasses because i fell asleep so soundly wearing them seriously if you have insomnia buy these they aren't cute and you may feel silly wearing them but when you feel your first good night's sleep after months or years of sleepless agony you'll be sold i'm buying a second pair to keep in my travel kit cant wear reading glasses with these otherwise decent quality well made really works for me i wish these came as traders definitely blocks the blue light but frames are a bit rough the plastic on the ear pieces are not smooth scratch up the skin because they do the job they are supposed to other glasses from competitors did not i am keeping this pair good buy for the price i really believe that wearing these glasses in the evening while working on my computer or watching tv helps me sleep much better although it depends on how late you go to bed and how much you have on your mind it does what it's supposed to do appear to function as marketed price is right very satisfied good purchase works well at the computer superb product does exactly what it says perfect when on the computer too long i really appreciate these glasses non prescription and no magnification for working on the computer but they are just a bit big and awkward but i would prefer them than dealing with the blue light from the computer saw news segment on these and decided to give them a try so far so good inexpensive and effective for use before bed to block out blue light great good on the computer fit over prescription glasses blocks the blue llight these glasses absolutely block the blue light that interferes with melatonin for sleep i am completely happy with them mr readers fit on the outside so i can still knit and use my phone with them on you won't beat the price and free shipping either in my opinion i use them every night and i fall asleep much quicker now i have had great experience with uvex ski goggles helmets and now blue light blocking computer glasses the computer glasses are too big but when i wear it over reading glasses it fits perfectly i immediately noticed a dramatic big difference when i first put them on images are sharper clearer works great for me awesome these glasses are true to what was promised i am and don't get to my email games etc until evening which has disrupted my sleep when i received the glasses and opened the box the information inside did not include information on blue light reduction so to be sure i called uvex directly they called me back and reinforced that this style does in fact block of blue rays i am ordering their pack because for the price and the protection there is no better value great uvex customer service i have also been buying uvex ski goggles for years so their reputation still stands for quality as far as i'm concerned a definitely dulls bright light wraps head and fits snuggly screens are still crisp looking as advertised and only they block the blue light just as reported in consumers report and i can use my ipad with night shift longer other blue blocker leave my eyes dry eye stinging i wish they fit over my prescription glasses i use readers over the uvex blueblockers very inconvenient the padded rubber ear pieces separatd from the plastic frame and eventually came off rendering the glasses less comfortable however they re still usable and they are the best blue blockers i have found so far p bought these for anti blue on computer i took off star because the box they came in said nothing about being for anti blue computer screen box only said for satety they fit ok ok and are sturdy glasses but i bought them because the advertisement on amazon said for anti blue on computers lightweight comfortable and flexible don't break when leaned on lying down good coverage no peripheral light gets in bought one for late night tv and one for office computer have dimming software but these make the light far more comfortable to bear during late sessions totally happy and they were under purchased for use with my computer at night but will be taking it to my pistol class to show off comfortable once the ear pieces are adjusted works great but wish the frame was made sturdier it feels like cheap protection eye wear they wear on construction sites bought these quite some time ago just what i wanted fit great work great for canceling blue light from computer monitor and the blue light from my kindle paperwhite i do look funny cool considering price these are hard to beat using it even now it helped to stop my eye twitching i can sleep at last these orange uvex skyper glasses worn every evening in combination with the luminette bright light theraply glasses worn every morning have totally transformed my life prior to buying these two items my sleep cycle had been appallingly since uni days years of working on a laptop all night in a brightly lit office had ruined my body's ability to regulate its sleep i'd be bursting with energy at midnight and then still powering away at dawn it was easy to stay awake for hours at time but almost impossible to sleep mornings were just awful and i'd feel lacklustre all day until about pm when my energy levels would begin to rise again over the years i had often tried to reform my sleep but without any success clearly my brain was simply not producing melatonin a few months ago i decided to start an experiment to see if cutting out blue light at night and then adding bright blue light in the mornings could overcome the chronic sleep problems the science seemed valid so i hoped it would work on me i bought both the uvex skyper orange glasses to block blue light in the evenings and the luminette glasses to simulate bright daylight in the mornings and used both diligently every day as part of a program to reform my sleep here's what i experienced within a couple of weeks of wearing the uvex skyper glasses i started getting sleepy at around pm like normal people do after just a few mornings of wearing the luminette glasses i began to enjoy waking up i couldn't wait to pop on my happy glasses as they made me feel wonderful now more than months later i wake every morning around am feeling bright and cheerful the quality of my sleep has been completely transformed only three months ago i would wake every half hour and then lie awake for another two or three hours now i sleep soundly the whole night through based upon my experience here are the key conclusions i'd to share with others if an inability to wind down or fall asleep is your main problem then the orange uvex skyper glasses around should be your first purchase because if you can kick start your melatonin production at night then you will sleep better and wake happier however if you struggle to wake up and you feel sluggish for hours afterwards then the luminette glasses could be transformational for you as they were for me i used to hate mornings and now i love them you still need to be sufficiently self disciplined to use the specs diligently e g if i forget to wear the orange glasses for a few nights then my old habit of staying awake all night quickly returns i'm writing this review jointly for the uvex skyper blue light blocking glasses for evenings and the luminette sad bright light therapy glasses for mornings because i used both over the same time period and it isn't really possible to tell which of them has contributed most to resolving my sleep and wake problems awesome works well glasses are great dr's order to cut out the blue lights before bed i now rest better and can still answer emails before bed i use these while watching television and computer a few hours before bedtime to block blue light which interferes with my sleep consumer reports has it as number one blocking nearly blue light and made in the usa awesome i love these glasses i put it on hours before bed and it relaxes my eyes and i sleep better these glasses are amazing heard about them at a ted talks program they relieve eye strain from working on a computer even an i phone anything concerning blue light ordering more for friends use them when i remember good quality haven t used them with the computer much after i got new mac s that have the night shift feature well designed well made great price blue light and effect on melatonin a real thing per my optometrist info in articles i've read and my own experience noticeable improvement in my sleeping with these glasses use in evening with iphone ipad kindle enable blue light reduction on devices but still get major benefit from these glasses device blue light reduction capabilities have varying degrees of effectiveness also wear when working on mac computer in evening to supplement blue light reduction of flux software i installed on mac also sometimes wear when watching tv before bed colors more muted on tv screen but does not affect my enjoyment of what i am watching at all these are comfortable to wear i slept better the very first night i used these so worth the money i researched before buying a pair and found that some blue light blocking glasses block out a very low percentage of blue light these were top rated and i'm so glad i bought them the only downside is they do distort the colors on your computer but for me a good night's sleep is worth that sacrifice sporty and comfortable enough to wear during prolonged blue light low level exposure or staring at a blue light transilluminator to look at syber green gels etc made in usa by honeywell and have adjustable frame however if you need a pair that fits over prescription glasses and also has the added feature of blocking a wide range of uv abc then go with the uvex ultraspec s x also available coated sct orange the skyper sct orange is for blue and the packaging has no certification or uv abc wavelength t measured i've been wearing these almost every night while on my cell phone before bed no complaint so far but if you wear glasses you probably want to get the clip ones i feel awkward wearing these over my glasses works great good price just received these today and so far they fit very well covering all of the eye area and they block blue light well well i use these to block blue light before bed time if i'm looking at a screen they seem to make a difference they are actually real comfortable and you can adjust them pretty well definitely a good deal for under bucks highly recommend these great product and almost instantaneous the sensation of sleep soon to use i recommend i have bought several of these and there is a reason why it works mmmm not sure i bought two pairs of these from two companies i think what i need is to get the coating on my glasses because i am layering these over my rx lenses but they do seem to help i have been using these every night at about pm i have been in bad state of health this past year and a good night of sleep seems to be crucial for my well being the next morning i can feel the difference in my body when i use and don't use these glasses for people that have problems with their circadian rhythm these glasses are great at getting you back on track improves contrast laptop image is more restful very happy with the product does what it says on the tin they do work in order to block the blue light and improving your sleep but they're not comfortable at all after minutes because of the plastic perfect for working on the computer and my eyes not getting tired i like them because they work well to block out the blue light transmitted from the tv and lights in the home if you can discipline yourself to use them then they will be a good buy otherwise they will remain in a drawer not the coolest looking when worn around the house to watch tv and use a laptop at night but these just work perfect for blocking blue light and not messing with my sleep patterns we got the uvex s x ultra spec glasses for eyeglass wearers at our house this is the right choice for those not wearing glasses at night it is comfortable blocks well from the side and like the other product the bows may not extend far enough if you are particularly large we recommend them not sure if they are impact resistant unfortunately be sure to check a price tracker the price on these is up and down all the time surprisingly good quality for the price these are great and do block out the blue light spectrum i use them every night as i watch netflix or youtube trying to fall asleep i know not using a digital device before or in bed would typically be better but i need it to keep my mind from racing about everything i have not done need to do how i could have done some things better the difference in my ability to fall asleep has been amazing and they're very durable as i've woken up laying on top of them a number of times bought these to help me sleep at night bonus my kid thinks they're funny to wear and makes her fall asleep too i like these and tend to scratch less than the other pairs i've owned the cut out all blue light as far as i can tell i like these glasses for blocking out the harmful spectrum for my eyes i feel safe yet can see better than with regular sun glasses the only blue blocker glasses that i've been able to find that actually block out almost all blue light i always put them on about a half hour before bed i ordered one for myself because i needed these as my eyes have become sensitive and sore to my phone screen and so far they work great i didn't give this a star rating because i ordered another pair for my brother and they delivered one with dry super glue on one of the screen and we tried wiping it off but to no avail you can clearly see the swirl by my middle finger and thats they delivered it i really sleep better when i use them realistically i am not turning off my electronics an hour and a half before bed so this has helped with that i have been having sleep issues since i stopped using them so thats definitely a factor they are great so comfy work great use them at night to reduce blue light exposure only minor issue is they don't wipe off easily i usually end up rinsing them in sink with mild soap every now and then these are so cool and afforable i love i play and code and it the best the for price i bought these for a single purpose to read on my smartphone or laptop at night i have read that exposing yourself to blue light at night can keep you awake this seems to be a scientifically based fact while ideally i would completely stop looking at a screen at night these are my go to when i can't resist i read that these shades block a very high percentage of blue light pros they block a large amount of blue light they are substantially less expensive than competing fashion frames that block a fraction of the blue light cons not office attractive but i only wear them at home only good for reading or other black and white work designers up all night working who need full color and no distortion can't use any yellow lens especially such intense ones as these in sum if you can't break your reading on scren at night habit these should help reduce the insomnia that can result i work exclusively on computers for too many hours a day after lasik i decided to try out some glasses that block uv for work since i no longer need my prescription lenses which had that protection they are chunky but adjustable unless you have a tiny head like mine in which case the ability to rotate them is more important than the ability to lengthen the arms the nose piece holds them well but someone with a slight never broken nose might consider additional pads it blocks blue light our phone lights are blue plastic over white bulbs and they look unlit with these on greens look amazing but if you need color differentiation visually you'll either have to learn how the new colors look or go a less full route normally looking at a computer screen leaves an after image when i close my eyes or sometimes with them open with these glasses there is either no after image or it fades in seconds the design also blocks my desk fans from drying out my eyes which is a nice bonus overall i have found this pair to block the most long blue light visually not as measured with a specific tool and the reduction in after images is a pleasant surprise i don't need reading glasses yet and i'm hoping to prolong indefinitely the time until i do no more eye strain thanks great product at a great price they really work it's also amazing to see how they limit the blue ray dry eyes that you expierience after using your ipad smart phones tablets computers and lap tops to frequently these also help you fall asleep if you have issues going to sleep on a consistent schedule these are really nice i actually started using them more than just before bed they make my eyes feel less stressed the five stars i'm giving look pink with them on nice lol i trust they help block the light they are a little big for my face but that's okay because the glasses extend to the side which i suppose will block more light i am pleased with the like them two hour after i put on those miracle glasses i feel so sleepy so far so good work excellent to help ease me into bedtime mode i like them when i can remember to use them they do help with eye fatigue works well i have used these for awhile now and find they do really take stress off the eyes when working on the computer into the evenings i would not recommend using anything all of the time that alters what you see but it works and using it sparingly may really help you out i bought this pair to replace my first one the first uvex skyper blue light blocker for some reason the adjustable right ear piece on the inside side split obviously the soft plastic didn't hold up well enough however its light weight has broad full coverage the appearance is similar to the eye protection lab glasses in the science class that's why i give it star rating for durability appearance ok work as advertised well made work great no problems these glasses are great can't stay awake for very long after putting these on and i'm a major insomniac i hit the and a half hour mark and i get exhausted and sleepy looks ridiculous but who cares if you're sleeping like a king right these glasses are amazing they can be adjusted to your face and are comfortable to wear for long periods of time i bought these because my trouble falling asleep significantly affected me at work and at school and i suspected the hours that i typically spend at computer tablet etc each day i wear these glasses all the time now and have no trouble sleeping best i ever spent they are comfortable and allow me to watch tv in bed and still get a good night sleep not the sexiest bedtime outfit but i have not had any complains yet can't beat the price and they are comfortable it does seem to help preparing us the last couple of hours before going to bed dr joseph mercola recommends you get these over the more expensive ones as they do just as well these are the real deal they protect me from electromagnetic radiation of who knows which wavelengths but truly i sleep like an angel when i wear these at least hour before going to bed this is a staple for anyone who wants to get good sleep i use these primarily to reduce blue light to aid my sleep quality when i used the online blue light blocking test where you compare two different color patterns it seems to block out most of the blue light so kudos from the blue light blocking perspective it does change the colors pretty dramatically when you first put them on but your eyes will adjust slightly and the picture on your tv etc will look more acceptable over time but of course will not be nearly as good when watching without these the lenses are cheap plastic but what do you expect for under my primary issue is that these are huge and do not fit my face well i have a low nose bridge and high cheekbones so these sit on my cheekbones as such these are not as comfortable as glasses that rest on my nose bridge and i can see the bridge on the glasses when wearing them because of the poor fit i tried another pair of computer glasses on amazon although the other glasses had a slight yellow tint when i tried the online test it appeared to not block much of the blue light so i returned them if anyone has a recommendation on another brand of glasses that blocks most of the blue light please let me know i may try the other uvex glasses s x but my guess is these will not fit my face very well either i want to be able to read e books and watch t v in the time leading up to bed i tried some more expensive about glasses meant for gamers and they didn't block enough blue light these do i've even had middle of the night times when i couldn't sleep and these do the trick my only caution is i wear wire framed glasses and the curve on these can bend the frames a bit changing their focus as a result i wear the uvex glasses without my prescription glasses which means i miss most things printed on the t v screen but the way this helps me at bedtime is worth it i checked to see how much prescription blue light blockers would cost ouch ridiculously high nice fit works great as described very happy with product delivery time i got these to help with insomnia i put them on while working on my computer or ipad in the evening by blocking the blue light input to my brain they have helped me get to sleep at my normal bed time they're adjustable and fit over my glasses very inexpensive way to prevent insomnia without drugs i just feel better using these whether they're superior quality or not i don't know i love them i just wish they weren't so darn fugly you'd think with the whole limit blue light at night thing they could make an affordable fashionable pair the blue light blocking properties are excellent definitely notice a difference in ease of falling asleep wearing these at night before bed while using a computer tablet or phone the fit is adjustable but i still find it too close to my face that my eyelashes brush against the inside of the lens the fit behind the ears is uncomfortable even after adjustment as they are designed to prevent them from falling off easily it's like my second grade teacher grabbing me by the ear when i would talk during class very comfortable and seem to do a good job filtering blue light based on my reduced eye strain i would recommend uvex glasses i use this pretty much all the time for computer use for driving and as protection when mountain biking mtb i think the mtb has abused them a bit as far as scratches but it's been a good test i'd say i have several hundred hours on these glasses with about being riding trails visibility through the lenses has remained mostly unchanged i expect them to last out the season and be replaced for next spring i'd like a bit more durability with the lenses but for i think they are holding up well enough and as stated they are comfy i hope this review was helpful takes the glare off of the computer screen i use these when i feel a migraine coming on or if using computer tv when late helps reduce eye strain and once you figure out how to put your normal glasses over them they work awesome both of us find them great for computer and tv viewing cuts the blue rays and glare using them right now it's been about a month and i rarely use screens without them anymore i can work as long as i want now without my eyes complaining amazing for the price i wish the same company provides a cheap prescription option or clip ons or something like that works good and good price i slept very well the first night i wore this eye wear but i did not sleep that well from the second night perfect just what i needed i really liked them this are the first pair of glasses plastics that allow my eyes to be fully open outdoors i actually purchased the other ones that have more space to have your regular glasses on after i checked these look they say computer glasses because i assume they don't block uv like sunglasses i suppose but i would not use them in my computer since i cannot see blue colors there i don't see the point they are great for working on your yard i can finally sleep well with these glasses i wear them hours before sleep before i got this my phone even with night shift on kept me up all night even my pc with f lux turned on these glasses have excellent side coverage as well excellent blue light blocker as a college student i'm on my computer a lot and i was really having trouble getting to sleep after being on the computer so long but putting these glasses on before bedtime has been a tremendous help i get tired like i'm supposed to lol thank you these are great i wear these before bed and immediately get sleepy works well they are adjustable and so fit well and thus don't slide down on the nose also according to consumer reports they block out almost all blue light which for the price is hard to beat cheap but good value i bought a pair for each of my children they are comfortable and they block the blue light from electronic devices to improve the quality of their sleep the science may still be out on blue light blocking and it's impact on human sleeping patterns but you can't deny that wearing the uvex skyper blue light blockers at least makes you feel like you're accomplishing some good for your body put a pair on for minutes and watch tv stare at your phone or work on your laptop and if you slip them off you'll be amazed at how blinding that light suddenly feels we just don't notice it because our eyes adjust the uvex glasses demonstrate just how bright it actually is i purchased these because they appear to block more blue light than the other available options while many competing products on here claim to block blue light they ultimately have come up short in tests done by reviewers these didn't however while the competitors may not effectively block blue light at least they look somewhat normal these look ridiculous they are obviously designed as safety goggles for working with power tools and have been repurposed to satisfy the blue light crazed crowd and that's fine with me because they do the job well but the idea of wearing these out of the house or at my job which does not require any power tool beyond a computer is laughable my girlfriend still giggles every time i put them on and frankly i don't blame her and thank her every time for not immediately leaving me but if you can get around all of that for the price of these they really do seem to give your eyes a break so put them on minutes before you go to bed and let the scientists worry about whether it actually does anything to your melatonin production or not it won't matter because you'll definitely feel better really reduces eye strain always fun to see the difference after wearing these for more than hrs so much blue light is emitted from everything at night but if you got a larger tham average noggin like me they may fit tight great for the price blocks out the blue light from my kindle and computer i use these at night if i'm going to be reading or watching tv before i go to bed i am sleeping better so i guess these work good enough for regular computer use poor for gaming as it changes color of objects in game as to make them unrecognizable i wear these when i'm near daylight bulbs and when working in my photo studio with bright blue light emitting lights these work great to block out the light and after hours of working under daylight bulbs i don't get a migraine anymore they are light comfortable to wear for long periods and they fit my low bridge nose and unlike another blue light blocking glasses that i ordered from another company these do not have a strong chemical smell no smell at all sure i look kinda funny and my family giggles and calls me bono when i wear them but it's worth not having migraines and eye pain anymore they work well and are generally comfortable the only downside for me is that i also wear glasses and they are a bit ungainly over glasses consumer reports showed that these cheap sub glasses block out more blue light that some of the fancy and overpriced glasses mostly marketed to gamers that cost x's more these glasses don't seem ultra durable and even feel somewhat cheap as far as construction but the fact is they do the job and won't break the bank well spent high quality for a reasonable price the adjustable fit is great the price was by far the best the rating these have for screening out blue light was also the best love them they work well for blue light blocking but i wish the bows weren't adjustable these are the best blue blocking option for what you pay they work great before bed to get you ready for sleep works great to block blue light from tv computer a little big on me but i still use it good price they do the job i seem to have less eye strain watching t v makes me sleep better good i can put my reading glasses over them too blocks the blue light coming from monitors really apparent when you are looking at cold florescent lights excellent good quality and inexpensive cant ask for better i purchased these because it seemed more effective to wear them for multiple uses rather than pay and up for a computer screen tv screen etc i made the right decision to purchase wrap around glasses they aren't a perfect fit as they tend to push away from the bridge of my nose but it works well enough i have noticed i fall asleep quickly when wearing these to watch tv late at night my eyes feel more rested and less eyestrain when sitting in the dark and or with minimal soft lighting the ear pieces are adjustable and if it weren't for the push effect annoyance it would be a star rating definitely would purchase again to aid in falling asleep when i get overstimulated by computer and or television light i need glasses to prevent some blurriness while i'm wearing these and my thin wire frame prescription glasses fit well enough with these on but usually i'm not wearing them because the point is to not end up staying awake hours past my bedtime they work i have amd so these are perfect for blocking all the blue light i wear them when working on computer and watching tv late a night they are so comfortable i forget i have them on they are perfect i love 'em use for reading and tv watching at night and these are perfect for blocking the blue hues so i can sleep protect your eyes i got these for work to use while i wait for my prescription versions to come in my eyes get very tired looking at screens all day and this helped while i was waiting for them they came in a wee bit small even when you extend the glasses arms so i had to make a little bit of modifications to them but they overall needed to do what i wanted them to do and for the price you can't beat it more construction quality glasses still useful for the purpose of blocking blue light got these to wear for my rd shift under energy saving long tube light bulbs as well as computer screens i am not allowed to adjust now playing around with them i find some of my light bulbs at home may be contributing to my shift work insomnia these are well worth the price just to run around and find out whats effecting you it does alter colors somewhat but who cares if you were an insomniac like me a little big on me but it does help sometimes i fall asleep with them on sometimes as i expected other reviewers said they won't fit over glasses and they were right that's the only negative thing i can really say i have a small face so they can slide down my nose but they work fine for watching a movie tv at home after sundown my family gets a few giggles out of my space cadet look i haven't noticed a particular difference in sleep but i think it will be more apparent over time and consistency of use but i notice a dramatic difference in eye strain pain from the big blue screen it is instant relief these work great for blocking blue light and stimulating melatonin production also i do wear reading glasses but i normally wear my readers down on my nose so they fit over these glasses easily superhappy with my purchase got one for myself and one for my brother we both noticed an immediate improvement in sleep quality by wearing these two hours before bedtime we're behind screens a lot only downside it feels uncomfortable on my nose after a while though i have a bony big nose so i'm not sure whether this will apply to everyone in short worth the money very happy these are an inexpensive pair of blue blocking glasses i put them on around pm for about the last three weeks and i feel like i fall asleep faster and get a better quality of sleep who knows it could be the placebo effect but i like them i used these at nights great for spotting traffic police as a student with some sleeping issues i find these to be super helpful i will usually pop these on an hour or two before i am ready to go to bed while i am still sitting in front of my computer monitor it has become part of my nightly sleep prep they work they have an excellent fit plus soft padding around the ears for a comfortable secure grip wearing them all day you want comfort wonderful product works great i ve been using these glasses when sun goes down to watch tv check social media on my phone and surf the web and they work minutes after i started wearing them i'm already yawning i wear the uvex glasses over my regular eyeglasses granted i had to extend the temples the only issue i find is that the glasses change the colors substantially for instance blues look green so i think i am going to try the amber color glasses i believe those do not change the colors as much exposure to high levels of blue light close to bedtime can suppress the production of the sleep promoting hormone melatonin on the other end of the spectrum yellow and amber lights do not block melatonin production helps alot worked just fine stars at blue blocking these block even more blue than the f lux application does i took one star off because one of the adjustable arms is stuck in place on my pair i'm not gonna return them because they work fine otherwise so it's not worth the hassle as many people have pointed out there is pretty much no way to wear prescription glasses under these i recently had cataract surgery and am light sensitive i see a lot of haze and glare these have enabled me to drive safely by clearing up the scene and increasing contrast i am glad i found them work just as adrtised wish they made a clip on for those of us who wear glass s really helps with getting sleepy at night just wear while watching tv or computer sleepy time soon follows works great blocks out the blue light my eyes felt better when i took these off at am from a gaming marathom than when i put them off hours before that happy gaming your eyes will adjust to the yellow amber color dw especially works when winding down to sleep and soft light is needed for calmness i bought them hoping they would help me sleep and even though i was skeptical they did help so much in fact that i bought another pair for my grown daughter who also suffers from difficulty sleeping i bought uvex skyper blue light blocking computer glasses with sct orange lens for my husband he loves to wear them when he cuts the grass because they fit like googles and he likes yellow lenses to filter the light but one thing doesn't make him happy there isn't room for his prescription eye glasses soft arms wide coverage fits pretty well on my smallish nose super comfortable i use it before sleeping so i can watch alittle tv without blue ray stimulation i think it works i wear these frequently and feel they help a lot with me getting sleepy i'm honestly not sure if it's a placebo effect or not but if it works it works i'm ok with the placebo if it helps me fall asleep as i'm reading my book works great for me and hopefully great for you as well really good lens quality it adds so much contrast terrific buy considering the price i ordered it and got it these glasses are by honeywell which i have heard of before but i hadn't head of uvex the product description on amazon says made in china but the blurb on amazon says made in the usa the glasses themselves have an imprint on them that says made in usa i have a large head and they fit comfortably on me the temples are not too tight and the nose bridge feels comfortable they have a hefty load of disclaimers on the inside of the cardboard package they arrive in in total shortened don't use for athletic games or recreational activities other than target shooting and archery don't use for paintball or simulated war activities don't use for protection against laser light don't use for chemical splash or chemical vapor exposure which may crack the surface they offer limited protection against sun glare or other light sources and should not be used for welding brazing or cutting operations there is a good deal more and when i put them on during the day and looked at the computer the glare from the window bothered me where i had not noticed it without any glasses on i was not able to see the color blue as blue it appeared more black or grey you would not be able to wear them over glasses as for the ratcheting system on the legs of the glasses there was no instruction included to adjust these and i am still trying to figure it out not because i want to as the glasses feel fine to me but just to see what they meant they come with no protective case to keep them in new yes like the glasses a lot i love these glasses they are helping me to avoid all the harmful rays ok these are very helpful when allowing me to read or watch a movie on a device before i am ready to sleep these fit really well really worth the money spent good product good price i use these for the last hour or so before i go to sleep especially when i'm using my phone or tablet colors are a bit wonky lol but i think it does make it easier to fall asleep blocks blue light wavelengths signaling the brain to release melatonin don't know if these are helping me sleep better but they do block out a lot of blue light these aren't bad i put them over my smaller glasses so they are a bit uncomfortable with both however they do the trick to block out the blue light on my tv phone or computer at night which is what i purchased them for they block out all the dangerous ultra violet light nm adjustable temple pieces very good i love it using at night for reading from my ipad really helps reduce the blue light so my sleep isn't affected before bedtime i'm a busy marketing manager and stare at a huge plasma all day i can immediately feel the difference and comfort in my eyes just within an hour of wearing them and amazon prime delivery was on point if you have photophoia photosensitivity or migraines you seriously want these for the computer they block the hardful light good for blocking the light that interferes with melatonin production and thereby helping with sleep awesome product i feel drowsy very quickly worth more than just product works as intended arms are a bit short for a tighter than expected fit behind the ears something to wear at home but the lenses are too large making it not stylish enough wear around anyone but family in my own personal experience and opinion the glasses are as advertised and very nice quality great for blocking blue light from tv computers or cell phones as expected may not look as cool as joe mercola but i wear them when sun goes down help my energy levels my mitochondria are also very happy brian o'loughlin got these for my boyfriend that works night shift so he can fall asleep easier after getting off work in the morning we have always used the 'night shift' mode on the iphone and a similar program on our computers for blocking blue light according to our sleep schedules it seriously makes a huge difference but these are great for driving home in the morning and watching tv before going to sleep they are not attractive glasses by any means but definitely work great for winding down before bedtime its a great product for the money invested they have the perfect fit and grip excellent plus that you can adjust them on the arms for a bigger extension and the extra protection by the side cover is cool in terms of protection its working fine felt recharged and well rested after first night using them love the glasses especially that i am able to wear them over my prescription glasses i wear them mostly at night when blue light is most damaging the price was right and it is doing the job of keeping blue light to a minimum protection from blue light is important to me these glasses fit the bill very comfortable to wear even for tv watching everyone should own a pair both pairs i purchased were immediately grabbed by my boss for driving glasses he thought they made him look cool they were awkward to use at the computer for my line of work but very slylish and comfortable i am loving these using them right now in bed lights off writing a review do they block blue light sure does blocking blue allow for your body to create melatonin or whatever the claim is well i can't prove that but i am sleeping much more soundly through the night and waking up feeling better i have several pair and am planning to give them away to friends just what my son wanted for late night computer vieiwng i use these at night when using my ipad and i sleep better quality glasses i really needed them or go blind these glasses are great i wear them at night when using my phone or computer and they really seem to help with the over stimulation from the screens they actually received by far the best ratings from consumer reports in terms of blue light blocking they blocked nearly all blue light the only downside is they are also far less attractive than the other glasses which only blocked about of blue light so i guess it's a trade off if you want something to wear as you're winding down in the safety of your own home these are your best best however if you want something to wear at work more style and less function i'd go with another pair you can check out more info on the consumer reports website this really cuts the eye strain one gets from looking at a computer screen too long i already had the screen brightness turned way down but my eyes would really get tired looking at the mostly white screen the problem got solved with these glasses great product i have less trouble falling asleep when i use these glasses at night these glasses helped me to cut out blue light and sleep much better they are big enough to put over my reading glasses so they slide off easily but they get stars because i sleep now works great to block the light that keeps you awake when watching tv or using smart phones notebooks computers as many people play on their phones before bed these glasses prevent the light from keeping you up i'm tired and putting my phone down after min vs previously min recommended for getting rid of the blue light from the computer which interrupt sleep patterns great for kids adults my year old likes these ones block out blue light for better sleep great helped me fall asleep even though i was watching tv in the evening good price also and decent quality they fit loose if you have a normal size head but for the price they do a great job and definitely filter out the blue light gives good all round protection for the eyes and fits very well it seems to be well made and is comfortable to wear have bought another for my daughter who is on her office computer all day and on facebook all evening not good for the eyes so this blue light blocker is ideal for her thank you pearl p i tried these for use mostly before bedtime as i read on my ipad and or surf the internet just before bed time i was skeptical about the 'sleep improvement' claims used daily for about weeks consistently better sleep it gets my vote i wouldn't have believed it these are good quality also great glasses to wear at night before going to sleep i wear these nearly every night side arms have a slightly adjustable setting over the ear as advertised but not sure they work i've been extremely happy with my purchase i searched around for an affordable pair of glasses that would block blue light at the recommendation of my doctor after testing very low for melatonin and settled on these i purchased these for the high quality and for the affordable price point you won't find another pair that works this well for this amount of money i could tell a difference the first time i used these it does alter the color a little but that is fine because i really want to block out that harmful blue light at night i found out about these through consumer reports these glasses exceed the other blue light blocking glasses i have tried really great glasses super quality this is an experiment for me and i'm not sure the outcome yet do the job well sleeping is improved i wear these an hour before i go to bed because of the tv the pc or my phone my eyes feel rested and find that my ability to get into sleep mode is greatly increased they look dorky but whatever i'm not doing a fashion show before bed i have tried several blue blocker glasses and uvex is the only one that blocked of the blue light from several bright led light sources that i looked at with them on compared to several other brands that still allow blue light through all of the other glasses that i've tried filter some of the blue light but not all of it these are great for watching tv or looking at your phone late at night but be aware that they totally eliminate the blue spectrum so that may not work for some people who still want to see some blue in order to make distinctions between things where contrast is important i bought these glasses to block the blue light from my devices at night it's supposed to help sleep as blue light interferes with melatonin production the jury is still out on that but the glasses are well made for the price and very comfortable these are a godsend for my eyes price is right i keep one pair at work and one pair at home itsa niiice very like much satisfy terrific blue blockers they help me sleep great product these are very lightweight glasses and comfortable and i find good for glare reduction even though they are light in colour which makes them ideal for driving awesome my eyes are thanking me not sure if they actually help with the resting sleep but i like the fact that i am not glaring at a bright tablet screen when i am in bed at night while these are a little big they do the job of blocking blue light very well they are wrap around style and thus block light from the sides above and below additionally they are sturdy without being heavy the only down side is they are reminiscent of the chem lab glasses i had in college but it's a uvex product so that's what one should expect good they do what they are supposed to do i use these at night when watching tv or on ipad very comfortable for the price they are worth stars if they had cost more i would have put i love that they are adjustable the length of the two side pieces i have ears that are too close to the front or something and can never find glasses that fit but these are pretty close my husband has his out more and they work well for him i do find they sweat a bit when it's warm and therefore slide if i look down so they wouldn't be very useful as safety glasses if i had to look down but as blue light blockers for evening computer phone use they work well i now favor a different model uvex s x by the same manufacturer which fits better over reading glasses look for the uvex s x this model uvex s x is great if you don't need to wear it over glasses excellent product and seller i wear these at work everyday so much better than the company provided safety glasses and these actually protect my eyes from more than just physical harm wow i was amazed on how well they work you won't find a better product for the price it definitely blocks out blue light i've bought several pairs of more expensive blue light blocking glasses and these are by far the best at blocking blue light and also significantly cheaper they aren't the most stylish glasses but are great for wearing at home i have seen a noticeable improvement in my sleep quality wearing these in the evenings when i am on the computer i think is a fantastic idea very useful eyewear for an hour or so before bed a nice use experience best blue light blockers ever seem to help eye strain and do what they say no problem nice glasses and service they work i put them on about hours before bed and i start getting drowsy almost right away be careful to not take them off or close your eyes if you do even a tiny bit of blue light can reduce meletonin production and keep you awake they look a little dorky but not sleeping isn't too attractive either lol good great for watching tv or being on my ipad filtering out the blue light so i can get to sleep excelente producto uvex skyper blue light blocking computer glasses with sct orange lens very helpful for reading on a tablet or laptop before bed light from computer won't keep you up all night works for blocking out blue light at night would recommend to others but not as stylish or comfortable as other ones i have seen this glasses help me to use the computer for a longer period looks good for the price i really would recommend it to a friend who is having eye problems as advertised i use these at my house only i wouldn't venture outside with these they look a bit ridiculous and i feel like one of those crazy geared up runners with the short shorts lol with these kind of sunglasses on but inside watching tv and on my phone these are awesome i haven't slept so deeply or easily as i have when using these to watch tv beforehand besides looking a bit ok a lot weird these glasses do help with eye strain especially at night interesting these blue light blockers cut out all the glare and blue light on your computer screen android phone and television screen blue light before bedtime can delay melatonin production which helps you sleep these are really inexpensive and get high customer review while blue blockers get less favorable ones dr mercola published an article a while back about the disrupting nature of l e d lights on sleep i installed a filter on my computer screen but didn't have anything for my tv so i decided skeptically to try these well i hate to admit it but after wearing them starting at sundown until bedtime for a few weeks gone is my insomnia who knew soi just bought a second pair for my husband and he also is seeing a big improvement i have a pretty big head and these fit still working on if they have any effect on my sleep issues will update lenses scratch to easily but my eyes don't feel tired after a day of work excellent use these every night before going to bed in order to reduce the blue light effect on my eyes love these glasses really makes it easy to drive at night it cuts down on dazzle and it tames those terrible blinding actinic blue headlights so they can't be distinguished from normal headlights computer never used them for that so these glasses are ridiculous looking but i was desperate to find a pair of blue light blocking glasses to wear in the evening i get really poor sleep they absolutely work and they are super comfy my husband even tried them on and said the same thing yes i look a little ridiculous in them but my husband and i have something to laugh at and im pumped that they work totally worth it if you need to be able to use screened devices in the evening tablet phone computer tv but also have a hard time falling asleep wrap around shape good coverage no noticeable distortion i like this product lightweight and comfortable i am wearing them to eliminate the blue light from electronics as it was interfering with my sleep very good happy for the product thanks great protection a item as described great glasses works really well i use them all the time for an item priced under these glasses are indeed well worth the price they are not the most durable however as my pair has already broken perhaps partly due to my taking them along while traveling but they were still hugely useful while they lasted and can help people who heavily use electronics fall asleep better oh the joy my eyeballs feel so much better i'm taking online tech courses i almost fired my eyes right out of my head last week the blue light constant focus lack of blinking all contribute to eye strain this fixes most of that i adjusted my monitors to relieve neck strain also now i can pull to hours per session very good glasses i am definitely sleeping better i can not believe what a difference it makes less eye strain and reduced glare from tablet screen should have bought a long time ago i wish they would make readers with this tint great quick ship thank you the glasses fit a bit tightly but overall i've been very pleased with these glasses my sleep has improved markedly and i wear them for at least an hour before bed i have noticed that i become a little more tired at night and i've been falling asleep a lot more quickly i think the snug fit actually helps by preventing seepage of any light from around the edges i didn't enjoy reading with them on and so won't be wearing them while i read but that was just my personal preference otherwise i have no complaints and i've been very pleased with the results work as described my only complaint is that they don't fit over my glasses i don't even have big glasses they're a more petite frame still these don't fit over them well they become uncomfortable to wear very quickly your glasses basically get smashed into your face the tracking system didn't show much but the glasses did arrive on time they do block blue light as advertised great like it helps with light i need readers so will use as safety glasses good bargain price excellent product at a good price i put these on when the sun goes down i wear them till i am done cooking eating walking etc then switch to red lenses that block the full range of melatonin wrecking light these are great for their intended purpose block much of the worst blue light with almost no light leakage they are pretty comfortable nice adjustable fit with telescoping and rewatching temples and they are inexpensive i was skeptical how these would work regarding help with sleeping to my surprise they really did help i watch tv with them on for a couple hours before going to sleep and i do feel i fall asleep faster and do not wake up as often as i did before i tried these for the price i'm happy i tried them out this is the first time i have ever ordered any blue light blocking computer glasses it is different when wearing them but they are pretty neat and i'm sure are keeping my eyes a lot safer i recommend them to just about anyone and everyone i like them these work great i wear these at night while working on computer or watching t v for blocking out blue light to help my body mind get tired or wind down seems to be working price is good too works and wears nicely great for blue light before bedtime i like them i just wish they where a bit bigger so they fit over my glasses bigger than i thought but well made and sturdy had to find a larger drawer than planned but using and it works great looks nice very nice quality i keep this on my end table next to my phone chair it s so handy i keep a pen or two small scissors post it notes paper clips letter opener crochet hooks needle thread nail files a wide assortment of odds ends that i often use while relaxing in the evening it s well made too no more picking up things off the floor or getting up down for a pen paper etc nice quality decent product item exactly as

if you like how it looks buy it you won't regret it i bought and use this as an ipad stand on my desk much more affordable than any other 'made for ipad' product and works as good in my opinion stick a couple of those silicon 'feet' pads underneath that you get to keep from scratching furniture that keeps it from sliding you can adjust the angle of the tilt you want by adding self adhesive felt strips or pads on the side facing the rear of the ipad that also keeps ipad from getting scratched it is what it is i had to squeeze this into one desk drawer but it would have more easily fit into another drawer so the measurements are pretty standard nice looking well made keeps things in order very satisfied with the product it is very durable and if organization is what you are after this

the job i would buy it again works great for holding my iphone plus horizontally when using it as an alarm clock next to my bed i had to add some stick on felt on bottom to dampen vibration since it woke me up every time my phone received an email i liked it but sadly it was just a few mm too big to fit in my drawer other than that it is great you definitely get what you paid for but do check the dimension size of the drawer to make sure it fits works great and what i was looking for very good price for it too perfect for my teacher desk great product to keep your desk drawer organized matches

remaining organized i use it for my makeup i have an ipsy subscription and it fits my samples perfectly works great and allow my office supplies to stay intact muy bueno the caddy is made out of metal that feels very sturdy to the touch it designed provide a lot of space to place daily office supply in it and still have room for more however there are two flaws that i noticed and buyer should look out for the caddy's sheets of metal are not welded together instead solder at both ends of the conjoining sheets i have no fear of the caddy falling apart one day but it's poor craftsmanship and attention to details that cause the product to lose value for detail oriented individual because the caddy's sheets of metal are solder the walls are aligned neatly next to each other i have of caddies because one came without a tray and i had to get a free replacement and one of them have a gap in the back of the caddy because the sheets of metal aren't aligned properly overall i still recommend on buying this product for the price to quality ratio this product is best on the market as of right now you honestly can't go wrong with this product buy it i guarantee you would be happy with what you get suits it purpose aaa solid little organizer i like it enough to order another one for a different desk nice little caddy to keep my pens pencils guitar pics off my desktop so i can actual write ona tablet etc etc ample storage for paper clips et al no issues i like the size of this caddy it has room and a couple of small drawers just what i needed to organize remotes and miscellaneous items in end table it's a simple design that works with the slight angle for the foot it's easy for people to grab a single card it is what it says it is a bit expensive but it does the job loved this turned out better than expected love this perfect for limited spaces it is very well made and great for the price it has helped me so much in keeping my desk drawer organized wish there was an option to have the design reversed so the pens are on the left and the folder holder on the right well constructed keeps everything in line works like a charm very durable alternative use turn it upside down and place it under a piece of audio equipment it makes a solid base and lets air circulate so the equipment stays cool if you have your equipment in an enclosed or semi enclosed space consider adding a usb powered fan or an ordinary ac powered personal size fan sometimes it can be placed between two similar sized pieces of equipment nice organizer i think it would be too big regular sized home office work desk but if you got workspace to spare it's great well made but needed something bigger sleek and modern looks good and holds alot of supplies on my desk great nice perfect for my school supplies exactly what i was looking for great quality great love it my office drawer now is neat and well organized i am very happy with my purchase use it by my door to keep items separate built well super add on product and at a great price i ordered several to place at local business' with my cards i will be ordering more it's just what i wanted great quality metal good and sturdy i use this for my night stand drawer i love it it fits medication bottles and full size box qtips amoung other things it's tough tray nice great product for my needs totally in love with this and the other desk accessories would recommend totally in love with this and the other desk accessories would recommend lightweight and easy to fit in with our business cards so that i can have a stack ready for presentations keeps them together good quality held my business cards on my desk very well i got this for my dorm room last year and i absolutely love it it amazes me how much stuff i can fit into it now i have much more drawer room lol very useful love it does just what i wanted very nice for storage worked perfectly and looks exactly like the picture made very well and seems like it will last a long time i'm not sure if i should grade down rolodex or amazon as mine was missing the front drawer quality control as amazon was the shipper i think i can grade them separately rolodex has made a relatively sturdy little caddy it doesn't look cheap by any means in the end the missing drawer doesn't detract from what i personally need for the supply caddy else i would have requested a replacement i've filled it with sharpies highlighters signo pens and sakura micron pens each with a rounded corner and post its in the remaining drawer and some stylus it has eliminated the need in a junk drawer so it's a step forward towards clearing that desk great quality and very sleek this product is really heavy and really wide so unless you have a big drawer to put it in i'd advise you to look for a smaller one use this to organize the tablets and phones while they are charging i have folded business cards so this was excellent very sturdy and neat looking great price too you can't see the craftmanship of the holder itself in my photo but you can see how nice it holds them i was pleasantly surprised when my card holder arrived it was exactly as pictured and much sturdier than i expected the added bonus was being able to use it as a stand for my samsung j using it as a stand for my phone allows me to type notes while i m on a call which is great for me because i always seem to lose random slips of paper i ve used to jot down notes from phone calls great buy this is a great caddy it is a heavy duty all metal caddy it is made to last and will endure the test of time it holds all my supplies this caddy has replaced several cups that i had been using to hold all my pens pencils highlighters scissors and even my correction fluid it has a place for my sticky notes and all my other little goodies i just love this caddy not much more else to say it looks and feels like i expected based on the description great buy sturdy and has all the bins needed for a

how the photo looks it's missing the drawer i pretty much paid for half the product didn't quite fit in my desk but i was able to make good use of it in my kitchen drawer hard to mess this one up nice it's fine as described good deal this is a great organizer i use in my desk at work before my drawer was so cluttered with stuff rolling around everywhere this organizer helps all my little things stay in place only reason i didn't give it stars is because the entire organizer slides around inside my metal desk drawer it would be nice if there were rubber feet on the bottom to stop it from sliding when i open close the drawer not only is this a nice looking sturdy business card stand but it also works wonderfully as an iphone stand the angle is great and allows for the thickness of the iphone or ipad and the l figure thicker edges prevent the iphone from slipping or falling out in my new office wow this is the greatest thing since sliced bread i am so excited that i bought this i am a purchasing genius nice bought of these for some drawers i just cleaned out and i absolutely love them just be sure to measure your drawer before ordering as these are pretty big good quality it says it is from rolodex but i feel like it was kinda low quality the price is great and it totally did the job so i gave it stars but you could see pieces of glue and the little plate on the back that said rolodex was bent still these will look great sitting on a desk very good product i'm pretty happy and i'm a very picky teacher what can i say hold cards well kinda small but works a very nice item works well with all items and has a nice size to it good price too sturdy high quality and comes pre assembled perfect desktop accessory good fits my singular desk draw with space left for stapler and

holds everything i need it too in a neat orderly way sturdy clean delivered as promised this is ideal for my work station and keeps it looking clean and orderly a good price for excellent quality thank you for this very useful product prints vertically and horizontally very nice easy to use happy works great to label anything if you have every used other dymo label makers which work very well for making single labels one at a time this label manager makes it easier when making multiple labels nothing special but it does its job perfectly no complex unnecessary features it doesn't ship with a case a simple case could have made it an awesome product easy to use and works great i labeled my entire house i love it no problems at all i'm going lable crazy it does come with roll of tape buy the power cord is well worth it i'm a geek and have wanted a label maker for years this is exactly what i need simple label maker for my files and storage bins i am revising my review to all stars why because dymo support is excellent i had some trouble getting the label printer to work and they rebooted the label maker upgraded the software and it is working again they actually answered the phone quickly and a real live person helped me so i've had this thing like forever what can i say i hate doing reviews shrug but i'm bored so here goes its the handiest lil thing ever i try so hard to be organized and this label maker makes organizing so much more fun than what it should be i like the many different font and function tools it has not too many that you need a doctorates degree in computer science to use it but enough to keep it fun and entertaining the large keyboard and rubber buttons makes it easy to spell out anything rather quickly the ink must be made of wizard blood because this stuff never dries up or runs out the labeling tape lasts longer than expected is cheap enough to replace without taking out a mortgage like with your computer printer ink and super easy to install a new cartridge i managed it without having to call the customer service operator that doesn't speak english yay me i like that i can buy different color tapes and in different sizes i haven't done either but i like that i can so what could i possibly complain about well it can be a tiny bit tricky to get the paper off the back of the tape if you don't take a quick second to actually look at the back and just try to peel it from a corner hint the paper on the back that covers the sticky part splits in the middle so just fold the label width wise a tiny bit and the paper will magically open up and you can quickly label that bagel moms eat it and die before the hungry lil buggers come and claim it for themselves so if this thing ever breaks you can bet your bottom that i will be ordering the exact same labeler again works as advertised had it for a week changed a ton for me simple easy works at the speed of thought let's you make something formal in an instant happy i bought it so far haha i got this label maker when i got my house to organize and label items around the home it was delivered early and very easy to use i've used it a couple of times and so far so good i've only used it to label bins that i'm using around the house to organize nothing too crazy so i love it it works very well and has saved me a lot of money this works well considering the price and that you can get very cheap paper for it it doesn't have the best settings and customization abilities but i absolutely love it excellent product very easy to use love it it comes with a battery pack which you are supposed to remove if the unit will be idle for some time the charging cord will not power the unit unless the batteries are in therefore every time you want to use it you have to remove the battery cover and insert the rechargeable battery or leave the battery in against their recommendation because it will corrode if you do decide to leave the battery in it works quite well this is great i use it all the time even so the refills are affordable the next higher model has a clear button i might like stars aside from that works and does what it is supposed to do i enjoy using this i probably overuse it but i don't care perfect for its purpose and the features exceed the the price i needed simple for a modest price and received more than expected quality construction because i've dropped it several times and no problem love this works perfect easy to use you plug it into a usb port and print great affordable label maker thanks very good i originally bought this to put a label on my mailbox it was so fun to checkout all the features i constantly pick it up to label something new nifty product for my home use good little label maker works most of the time but sometimes it jams the label as it comes out not a serious problem i do wish i had purchased one that will print larger labels my fault i didn't read all the spec's love this so easy to use and works great remember to have triple a batteries to use ok it dies the job very nice and small unit this is a inexpensive label maker it works though i m impressed with the amount of features it does include worth every penny good clean print but tape doesn't stick on all surfaces supports two lines when the font size is small enough relatively easy to use max length of label is limited but not too much is wasted in between prints works great with plenty of label printing options wastes a bit of tape with each label but one of the good things about this label printer is that the tape it uses is actually affordable great upgrade from my previous labelmaker easy to use and makes great labels being able to charge it vs batteries is a great feature i didn t pay to much attention to this item when ordering and i didn t notice that it didn t come along with a power cord it did come with a roll of label tape really makes nice labels exactly what i was looking for very easy to use this dymo labelmaker is helping me get organized i am presently using it for the small tool storage drawers the lettering is clear and even with my aged eyes i can read the labels at a glance great prints for the money it can't be beat good but tape too short and old unit is good excellent product fast shipping i use this for labeling network cables switch ports patch panels and many other network related items it is small compact and easy to carry or store i have only used it with basic functions font size can be changed bolded underlined or italicized characters can me changed to print vertically or horizontally a nice feature i am not entirely happy with the keyboard functionality there is no clear so you have to backspace one at a time pressing and holding is also slow going it also takes aaa batteries you could buy an ac adapter but that obviously reduces mobility all in all it does the job great a little clunky but good quality printing and labels can't beat the price i got it for really easy to use printing options are good if you are looking to just have plain labeling there are no bells and whistles have to use two hands and the letters are close together but once you are on a roll it does not slow you down hate the cutting button because it is not a button on the front and you have to apply pressure to have the machine cut the tag good for the price and does what it is supposed to do bigger than i thought works great best label maker i've ever owned i love it it s simple and failproof i love making useful labels spice jars and ridiculous ones to entertain my family i have been in the market for a label maker for approximately yrs finally pulled the trigger on this dymo label manager handheld and i have not been disappointed it can print multiple lines of text not sure if it can do more than as i have not tried which was a feature i definitely needed the reason i finally purchased this label maker is that i was replacing my breaker panel and wanted to label all of the new breakers there is unlimited potential for labeling things and each day i think of something new to label it's also great for pranks one morning i labeled all of our cabinet doors and was sure to purposely place the labels in a different spot on each door this maximized my wife's annoyance and have me a great laugh as i acted like the labels were a great idea and not tacky at all fast shipping great product at a generous rate i think functional but not the best i ve ever used outstanding quality for the price and very simple to use this product is great simple to use print quality is great download software from web page use cable to laptop and it make long typed out labels a breeze came as expected i love it bought this to label when my bikes need maintenance used it today very happy see photo bought it for wife's office she loves it easy to use needed it to label bottles and has filled the void marvelously i love it i've gone a little crazy labeling things haha keep aaa batteries on hand the batteries last a long time for normal use but with heavier daily use you will want the power cord or a good supply of batteries love this product very easy to use and portable works great at the beginning it got jammed but i think it was just the begging easier to use then the hand held label makers the directions are pretty scarce if you tinker around with it you can figure it out i had the hardest time trying to change the language to english i can't find a clear button to erase the screen so i have to delete the previous word after every entry there is no backspace so that i can go back without erasing and add a letter or correct a typo the cutter seems to be razor sharp and cuts effortlessly cannot adjust the amount of unused label before and after a word great print with enough options on handheld i did not hook up to computer be aware and check the size font when you turn unit off and on it seems to reset itself to default overall the quality is superb nice soft touch keys it has it's pros and cons but i would definitely buy again love it it is perfect works great oh my i love this thing i've been labeling everything left and right from kitchen to random supply and storage i absolutely love this thing it does come with a starer tape which is ft i used it up quite quickly and purchased additional generic tape which worked just as well and was much less expensive haven't used the computer usb feature yet but fully intend to use it easy to use neat little labels i love it i ve had this label maker for two years and have yet to change batteries it works great my only gripe resulting in a loss of a star is that there is no easy way to delete everything short of hitting delete times to get rid of characters other than that it s a keeper easy to use great product really great label maker countless characters and options works great very easy to use a tiny bit confusing to set it up initially after than i leave it plugged in all the time and can make labels in seconds this works very well i used it to label all of the small drawers at my workbench and it helps me find parts and tools much faster i liked it best label maker that i have ever gotten especially at the discount i got it for off on great price and quality just needed an easy to use label maker and so glad i got this one great very good label maker also connecting to pc and have many caracters and icons works beautifully super easy to use only problem was i ran out of tape pretty quickly because i was a label making fool when i first got it i ran around my house trying to find things to label i am pretty sure i may have even labeled the dog don't judge me great portable printer for labels and you rarely go wrong with a dymo product i use this printer along with the dymo tape to label magazine baseplates hey the eyes aren't as good as they used to be without the cheaters on and they work very well also used for labeling tool locations as well as small parts boxes used in my repairs and customization business a lot smaller than my last dymo it takes a little getting used to but it still does the job where have you been all my life great personal labeler for house hold use easy to use and makes good labels for slapping on cables totes or whatever else you need it for love it i love the possibility to add labels to any important product in my office and my house easy to use and effective look close when you read the reviews here because it appears many different products are being covered my review is for the dymo labelmanager handheld label maker i was looking for a basic label maker for an electronics project i m working on mainly and anything around the house where a label would be helpful i paid a little more than i wanted to but i figured i would buy it use it for my project then sell it it s kind of like renting a brand new device and then getting most of my money back anyway it arrived quickly i was pleased with the size and layout of the keyboard and it was easy to begin using it after inserting the blank roll of label tape i tried my first test label the first label did not come out because it snagged inside label pathway i saw it as my mistake for not threading the cartridge correctly on my first attempt it really wasn t complicated at all just one of those little things that happened because i had never used it before opening the back again i was able to quickly fix the threading problem and start creating labels i was now able to quickly type and print labels with ease and no more jams i like that the current label does not automatically get deleted after it prints sometimes i needed the same label like on off for several switches on my project board once the first label printed i pressed the cut icon then immediately pressed print again without having to retype i ve found in life you can pick apart pretty much anything but i don t feel this product is one of them for the price i paid and the capability that it gives me i m pleased with the lm easy to use labels stick well would buy again good quality and does the job i've had a little trouble keeping connectivity with my old laptop running windows home it worked at first for a couple of weeks then following an update the program wouldn't load i did everything they said with no success i got a new laptop also running windows home and it's worked flawlessly again as far as printing labels goes it works great lots of variety more than i need works just fine love it might have some difficulties sometime but comes in handy for little projects good for the price too nice product for a reasonable price happy with the product good quality i was super excited when i got this in the mail it's everything i hoped it would be i labeled everything not bad prints everything a body wants and costs less than half the competition price i'm labeling anything that stays still long enough good little labeler takes x aaa batteries though kind of a tall order great easy to use and very useful love this label maker it would have stars but the tech hasnt seemed to change in the past few years still a great label maker and im already obsessed love it i bought this for a friend and she loved it a good product but the fonts and very limited and thought you could do more than one line on tape needed something more advanced if you don't need fancy fonts or more than one line its a great product nice label maker yes this does do two lines of print and includes a bunch of tape to start at that price it was a steal it is simple to use i was able to figure everything out without reading instructions the tape is hard to separate but sticks well great value for the price of machine and works great as advertised good label maker easy to use and very affordable i havent gotten it yet but i think im gonna love it but since i havent gottenr it yet i cannot give it starts just to be fair to the product i mean i could give it starts but what would the fun be in that just to reiterate i have not purchased the label maker as of this date but am eagealy awaitin g this is the second time i have bought this i lost my first one in a flood honestly we have about a million charging cords around the house and i never know which cord goes to what so i like to label everything this is very easy to use you can change the size the font and it's easy to handle i use it to label my bottles of spices i buy in bulk too i have bought replacement ink cartridges and labels before and everything was easy to change out very cool almost replaced my old one with a similar old style this one uses any font on your pc and can include any pic you have good price does just what i need it for great for organizing we use the heck out of ours first one died just out of the exchange period for amazon but dymo handled getting us a replacement a excellent comes in handy for files in the garage identifying pipes oil changes id parts fulfills its purpose stylish great quality good price i got this label maker for my boyfriend who absolutely loves it it works well and the coolest part is how many fonts symbols sizes and other text additions can be made as someone who is not technologically savvy i can assure you that this label maker is quite easy to use we are very satisfied customers easy to use could use a little more information skimpy manual but the unit itself it terrific i have an abnormal love for office supplies so i was not surprised by my happiness with this label maker it does what it says it will do it works everything in my house will be labeled now very good a excellent product great service wooks well use it alot great value works well best little label maker ever works like a pro batts last and after a few mishaps still holding up strong labels are pricey tho great product easy to use label maker works great but description is incorrect i did not receive a starter tape with mine even though it was listed as included the package was sealed but tape compartment was empty it s mi second lablemanager great good price love my parents have one and after using theirs i had to purchase one for myself easy to use received perfect couldn't beat the price this device worked like a charm the no back lit feature missing is ok for the value you get from the product compared to the price love playing with this it's soo easy i am pleased with this label maker it does an excellent job i bought them to use and we do daily works fine and got to me on time i have been thinking about a label maker for a long time since i have had this one i wonder what took me so long it's great i'd been looking for a label maker to better organize my nail polish swatch sticks as well as other craft supplies after looking at some more expensive options i settled for this and for the price point i'm very impressed and it's actually gone down a couple of dollars since my purchase it prints cleanly and the device is pretty intuitive though if you're struggling you can find the manual at the dymo website batteries are not included nor is the compatible ac adapter it does however come with a sample roll of tape all the labels in the photo give or take a few practice labels and typos were printed using the sample roll great for labeling storage items i have the brother label printer at my workplace and that unit is almost perfect except that it wastes a lot of tape with each printout i bought this dymo economy unit for occasional home use it s great that it doesn t waste much tape my only disappointment is that it comes with a caps lock button but no shift button i consider myself part of the tech savvy generation who by default types quickly and professionally and no shift button is just an annoying handicap that clumsifies and slows down my label making experience i guess that wouldn t matter if you re one of those people who always type in all caps also it seems about of buyers myself included receive defective units where the drive motor won t turn the tape spool before you return it there s a trick if the unit sits on the shelf for years before getting sold the motor bearings apparently seize up all you have to do is remove the tape cartridge and unseize the motor by turning it a bit with your fingers you will hear a mild pop sound and feel when the motor is unseized my printer has been fine ever since nice label maker works very well it comes with a set of labels but no aaa batteries or ac adapter cord you have to purchase separately easy to use love it i like this printer but only problem is the battery kinda running our fast easy to use labels are good does exactly what i expected it to do got this to keep up with when i have performed mantnace on my tractor makes it easy to know what hour my filters and such was changed simple to use very useful for labeling cabinets and marking things for organizational purposes use it as labels for my remote aswell works very well uses different sized labels and can print from a pc works great so many power adapters i'm a tech nerd and having so many power adapters everywhere this helps me so much because every time i get a new product i label what the power adapter goes to with this guy definitely recommend it great product reasonable price bought this for to replace my old brother labelmaker happy with this purchase need to figure out the price for the tape very good it works love it great label maker for the price paid my friend has owned the exact same one for over years and she still has no issues i love this label maker so many options would highly recommend amazing product awesome quality for only this product is actually better then my label maker only comes with roll of tape though that i went through very quickly you also need to purchase batteries for this product easy to use right out of the box it has turned me into a labeling fool no more wondering what this cord or small part goes to just label the cord or bag of machine parts and you are good to go great but on button lags does not come with any tape at all i'm sure this does way more than what i use it for but really just wanted to make readable labels in various formats very easy to understand and use item as expected somewhat awkward to use but once you get used to it its ok batteries do'nt last long but output is good great label maker just wish the labels would stick a little better longer term this is the best only used it twice but so far i m beey happy with this product i like how the lettering is burned into the sticker so the letters won't smear or rub off i use it for fishing gear so it's around water a lot and it works great it is easy to use you don't have to be a millennial it guy to understand how to use it does its job nicely works great makes labeling fun and easy couldn t be happier great price and does whats needed will order again fast shipping love it easy to use works great excellent product works as expected it does not seem to stick to glass that is in a humid area well but most other surfaces it works great this label maker is very handy and of good quality same model as that orange home improvement store sells but for a much better price great label maker different font size and characters works well works great is fast and the replacement ribbons won't cost you an arm and a leg great for those who like to keep organized love it i should have read the description so i would have known to buy batteries and or a power adapter too i started labeling things as soon as i turned it on be sure one your first use that you due a test with a word four letters long or so so that it can get the spacing calibrated i went through at least ' of label tape right away so excellent great machine for the price more features than the model it replaced and it was cheaper too easy to use with multiple options just what we wanted highly recommend i absolutely love this thing as a motivating tool for my students to track books and build lists as they can print and cut the labels themselves but the refills get to be expensive and it jams sometimes easy enough to fix just annoying workers rest just wish it had memory works great awesome price works great via handheld or printing via pc software i was hesitant to buy a lower cost label maker to label circuit breaker panels and controls use to using units had lent mine out and needed one in a hurry this did every thing i expected well worth it i bought this label maker so i could label the kids' backpack cubbies at the daycare i work at to keep all their stuff in one place and to avoid things going missing like what's been happening lately it's awesome it's very easy to use with a simple design not bulky or heavy at all it fits perfectly in my hand and i can type out things so easily the adhesive feature is really nice and it doesn't stick to wood to the point where it won't come off i can pull the labels off if need be but they don't come off by themselves i've only ever used this brand of label makers my mom has an older model about a decade old and it still works no longer missing anything as these labels really helped and i don't have any problems with this model highly recommend especially for work use very useful fiancee loves it great price and great functionality i bought this for my sister since she loves to be organised and she just loves it easy to use easy to refill best to buy a refill roll at the same time great labeler however the label roll that came with it was broken the wheel to extend advance the label strip was broken and didn't advance the label luckily i needed a smaller size label than it came with and hand one on hand other than that it's good stuff love it and it was very east to work works good i bought this to label all my ethernet ports and my patch panel along with my electrical panel the labels hold up well and all kinds of different options size and symbols great product for such a low price i replaced my second smaller dymo label maker with this one i like the keyboard better and am hoping it lasts longer the labels don't stick very well just like the other labels but i use a bit of clear tape over them and it does the treat good this is great easy to use with clear printing does the job love it works like it should lots of options characters fairly quick printing little bulky easy to use and labels look great using the cheapo everything a dollar store batteries works great just what i wanted for less than so far it is working quite well i did end up buying this power adapter which works well so i don't have to worry about batteries t power ft long cable ac dc adapter for dymo labelmanager lm lm ts d p lm d lm lm letratag plus label maker printer power supply they didn't stick too well on some plastic bins i had they were textured and not a smooth surface so i ended up using packaging tape to hold them on i like how there isn't much waster tape for each label and the tape was on sale for so that was a huge plus this is so easy to use that i never even looked at the directions the battery charges in the machine with the included charger it wastes so much less tape than the costco brother i bought before and returned very efficient i have another model label maker and the amount of label tape it wastes is upsetting i am so glad i found this one as it wastes very little i highly recommend this model and i am now a dymo fan i have not had this very long but it's easy to use and works great gives you font size options too no idea why but it would not feed the first roll of tape it cycles the next roll just fine so i threw the first roll out good product simple and easy to use i am very satisfied with the way this item works the battery recharges well and has a long life when the device is plugged into the computer you can create many labels very quickly and print them out i would buy this item again well now my whole world is labeled the dymo labeler makes it way too easy to label and organize buy it and you might get carried away the reviewer who showed a photo of a cat with the label cat did not hyperbolize i spent a day organizing and labeling bins in our storage room and now it's as orderly as a well run library and then i labeled the garage parts hardware drawer organizer and then the repurposed plastic spray bottles full of distilled water bleach mixes cleaners etc limitless opportunities a little tape seems to go a long way but i bought a foot refill just in case it takes a little playing around to decide which font sizes work well for what purposes but it's an easy device to figure out two special requests for their product developers please put common symbols right on the keyboard so we don't have to scroll through a menu to find dashes slashes and ampersands and please provide a single button that wipes out all the text when we create a new label it's a pain to only have the backspace button to do the job prospective purchaser please note that when you turn the label maker on it will come up with the text of the last label you made not a new clean slate otherwise a very fun and potentially obsessive toy for home and office organization good item i use this for like everything i wish you could download new fonts though if i'm wrong and you can let me know quiet easy to hold easy to understand my only complaints are that it can be a little difficult to discern spaces on the screen and the cartridges can be a little easier to install i love this thing i started labeling everything around my house i also love you can turn the letters long way to make the word vertical instead of horizontal the symbols are great too i show it to everyone that i know so far this has been a really nice label maker its handy to just type up a label and print it out love it my issue with label makers in general before this were they eat batteries or are always dead when you need them the label tape is so expensive i can't help myself from calculating the cost per label this is the first rechargeable label maker i've owned instead of using aa batteries that are dead every time you need it it has built in battery that lasts a good long time months depending on use another reason i picked it up specifically was so i can get generic branded labels for much cheaper than typical label makers sell their tape for i really like the fact it has built in memory i have some labels please return this book to for example which makes it easy to reprint more labels each month or week good labeler as described easy to use and to load built well good quality works as advertised i bought this to make labels for my essential oil blends it is every thing i ever needed easy to use it can print very small font size small enough to label all my camera batteries chargers lenses lens filter cases sd card case remote shutter release camera bodies tripod phone laptop ipad phone charger basically everything a very good idea when traveling in a group great` thank's purchased for my father for christmas and he is really enjoying it getting everything labeled in his shop etc i just may have to use his or get me one soon what a great labeler i had no idea how much i enjoyed putting labels on things well priced gets the job done sturdy the initial one i got wasn't working properly as the labels would roll within the machine but got a replacement extremely quickly i'm extremely satisfied with this machine and makes my job so much easier great product this is pretty good it definitely gives tapes smaller than a brother however the p touch series may be more versatile for text sizes i attached photos of a comparison with a p touch d i got for around five dollars black friday i tried to set both machines to the most narrow font dymo didn't have fonts at different font sizes smallest and largest i've had them both for a few months and i dont know where the dymo instructions are so if there are other font types i couldn't find them easily edit actually the brother wastes less tape at the end of a label but more in front if you make your labels as one long strip then cut them yourself the brother uses less tape we bought one of these a while ago and it works great the labels print consistently it's easy to change between font options etc basically it has all the basic options you could want for standard labels without all sorts of crazy features most people will never need use we wanted to get another label maker as a gift for my parents and knew they would appreciate many of the other positive features of this label maker display is large enough to read easily buttons are big enough to type without a bunch of typos buttons have characters large enough to read easily sure enough the recipient loves this works good for for just simple labeling i like this thing makes life much easier and tidier works great and is very affordable lots of different options for icons too handy and useful for intended labeling needs in office i love this machine don't label me on the contrary love it easy to operate very good really like this label maker easy to use easy to change cartridge i like the size feels similar to using my cell phone in my hands also like the affordability of it as well as being or at least appearing much more organized didn't know what to expect when i ordered this product after receiving it and making a few labels was fully satisfied great little labeling tool helping me keep my tool boxes and parts bins organized love it love the small size and ease of use it comes with its' own software built in but if you want more options you can go dymo website and download it after using it for one day i bought another to take with me when i travel i will be replacing my brother labeler with the dymo as the dymo doesn't require an external power source and uses less tape i will also get rid of the small portable labelers i have works great wish the symbols were a little easier to get to common one like for but overall this unit is great bought this to put my daughter's names on her bottles for daycare have since used it for multiple things not bad for the price work great it worked really well but then it got an unfixable jammed message now i have to buy another excellent label printer with multiple size color options for the labels highly recommended was a gift for white elephant christmas gift the person who received it loved it loved it just what i needed for those smaller projects works well and easy to use good affordable label maker cant go wrong with this much better and easier to used than the smaller version bought for my husband to use in his shop works perfect very easy to use and very good price love this one easy to use and multiple print options perfect for electrical labeling and when you working with your tool puch on nice and light easy to use works very well enough function for me this satisfies the ocd in me it prints clearly in several different font sizes i originally used this to label my daughter's bottles the labels have held up great through the dishwasher cycles now i use it for everything else labeling circuits on my house circuit panel large plastic bins tools etc works great very efficient ive had another label printer and didn't last for too long this so far outlasted the other one and is still working like new what an amazing value i entered into this purchase decision thinking that something like this would cost but later i can produce amazing looking labels easy as pie the text function did not work on the software for mac the device is pretty simple to hook up and use under windows the application does not automatically pop up i had to go looking for it and create a desktop shortcut no big deal the labels print cleanly and sharply even down to very small font sizes the only thing keeping me from giving it stars is that the label tape is not all that sticky and peels off a bit too easily on several of the items i've tried to label that wasn't a problem with the old standalone label maker i use to have i forget the make and model if i could find label tape for this one that stuck like the old one i'd up this to stars use it a lot to label my totes in my scrapbooking room easy to use good product good label machine works great and i like it better than the brother nice quality fast delivery should work great in my work making label would buy again great item i make my own salad dressing make labels for each and put date on bottle i label everything now love it nice and easy to use and refills are in expensive very nice label maker and the qwerty board is nice but accessing special characters is a little confusing at first love the way it prints works great works for me i love this super easy to use makes organizing a breeze i love this thing takes a moment to really understand everything you can do but if you can figure it all out it s pretty sweet great as most dymo labellers the keyboard could be better designed though caps lock and print buttons have strange pictures instead of the traditional caps and print but i guess that's a minor nuisance works very well labels look professional certainly much nicer than the plastic embossed dymo labels of the s s 'light' software doesn't need to be installed but the interface is a bit clunky it was hard to choose font sizes and make them persistent full software downloaded from the website works well great little machine works very well easy to use i ve labeled every errant electrical cord in my house i highly recommend for this purpose alone how many times have you lost the power charging cord to a device i know we have a box of old power cords with no home ugh no more after purchasing this handy little labeler great unit make tiny labels for my shadows in my z palettes also use for all my beauty oils can never remember what i ve put in each bottle nice features for a low cost model for occasional use had an issue with the battery not charging fully customer service was great this was truly a plug and play label maker the software was easy to install i was up and running in about minutes i've needed one of these for years and put off my purchase find i've been using it every other day since it arrived really smart for labeling your eliquid bottles when you diy them adding the date mixed suggested time for the full flavors to bloom and my name for the recipe along with base 's and mg ml my storage bins now have outside labels so i know what is in each blue rubbermaid silly stuff but practical love this label maker lots of options with sizes and fonts love my new label machine i'm organizing my entire office and all the switches in our new house that we can never remember what they turn on i really like the different font sizes and i'm sure there are many options i'm not even using right now i look forward to playing with it more super easy to use and to get started with works great very easy lots of fun needed to replace my label maker works great simple to use easy instructions love it still working am not a heavy user but now i have for over than months no complain works well the machine itself works perfectly fine i really wish it came with a manual as it took me at least two days to figure out how to actually make it work cassette was easy to insert but i couldn't get it to print had to insert a pen to manually turn it and then insert it great price for a product that is easy to use and does exactly what you wanted to do good and easy label maker works great worsk great takes aaa batteries love it easy to use and works well great labeler has helped me out with organizing i love this all you do is plug it in to get the screen to pop up on the screen works great my ocd demon is satisfied with this gift of devovation i love to label things i like the font options and ease of use great little organization option it s too hard to work with this item for me i just look at everything but i never work with it because it s so complicated for me and i didn t know i can return or exchange item in amazon until my friend told me now i don t know what to do with this item i never touch it and i never work with it it s exactly the way you send it to me and i wanted to know is there any possibility to exchange with something else the word extra clearly implies there is more than the original number there is no original number only cartridges with the labelmaker the item came with as stated on the box not cartridges as wrongly stated in the listing just what i needed and looking for a fair price for a good product love this thing i am labeling everything love this wish i would have bought it sooner simple but works well would be nice if it came with a case update lowering to stars due to poor mac support this label maker sucks on mac the light software would not work at all on mac the downloaded software had to be and it still stopped working and full re install didn't get it going below are instructions to help delete the proper files but i quit on the rd time it quit i'm not re installing software everytime i use the label maker possible driver conflicts they got four hours of my life and i'm not going to use terminal to troubleshoot their driver or conflict issues or whatever is happening bad mac support dymo i run a late macmini on high sierra and it's up to date as of upgraded and it's a very dependable mac possibly interfering with my network hp printer drivers anyway on windows the light software could work but i still had to download v from dymo to change fonts so far it plays nice with windows and i will update if that is not the case in the near future mac notes enter the following review and use it if you like to play with mac and figure stuff out but i decided to grab my dusty minipc from storage and print my labels from windows good luck this is a simple black and white printer for making labels the ease of use is very good with my mac i had to download the software from the internet to make it work properly as such it was slightly more work than promised after inserting the included battery and roll of tape plugging in the usb and power adapter the unit powered on and the software came up see your instructions on a mac the included software popped up but wouldn't let me click inside the label to edit my label make a new label or print the upper right icon in the light software can be clicked to download newest version software then on mac you drag and drop to applications and wait for it to install took minutes for mine then you can change fonts and sizes and print labels finally after going through these software issues i do have a small profile label maker at a price i can handle kudos to dymo for reaching out to the non ocd people who don't want to spend too much on labels we don't make very often check the different options for label tape on amazon or the dymo website you can find more options there to go with your purchase reasonable and effective solution to orgazining my electronics so i know where all my cables and things are works as described great product very good fast ship ordered this to get back into organization this is a good value for the money and certainly cheaper than some of your known marts it was easy to operate and easy to reload the cartilage i plan on using this for a very long time bought one to label some electronics next thing i knew my wife took it to her work in fact i have yet to use it and don't even know where it is i bet she does good print quality and easy to use great product very simple directions and not a lot or any description of many of the buttons but i figured them out and turns out to be a nice product very handy i wish i had bought it sooner i love this because they have color label tape other don t so that why i order this and it work great and can print letter in different size which i like also have symbols too i recommon friends still working great a year later outstanding very good functions well for its cost those who grew up with touch screen may get confused while using it but those who grew up with flip phones will inherently find it intuitive to navigate the menus excellent all good easy to use great product okay so you re probably thinking to yourself is it worth it short and sweet answer yes it is has a keyboard that isn t terribly annoying to use can even add symbols of your liking the labels are cheaply priced and of nice quality just like the machine it does come with some cons however the cons being that it takes aaa batteries sometimes prints with another black part from the ink that you have to throw out and the cut isn t always perfect this should not sway anyone away from buying it it s a great product and i d recommend it to anyone who cared about a label maker this little unit does way more than i thought it does i was printing single line labels but it can also do two lines albeit with reduced font size now here is the thing at work our coffee mugs would walk away and no real solution could be found because once it goes in the dishwasher it s open season the dymo branded tape with my name on it has stayed on my mug through countless dishwashings years worth and is still in good shape this machine and tape has paid for itself five times over in mugs that i have saved organizers necessity this is a great up dated dymo label maker easy to use and so many options and choices highly recommend i love this labeling machine does what it s expected to do i got tired of using small address labels handwritten to keep my boxes and folders straight i have to admit i did not have overly high hopes for this dymo based on the low price but i took the plunge anyway i wanted the labels for polypropylene boxes these from sterlite sterilite large clip box clear with blue aquarium latches pack i am really happy to say the dymo labels stick very nicely to the boxes as far as the machine itself simple simple simple to use and produces really nice labels i didn't even know when i bought it that it could print lines as well as a single larger font line for just buy it in addition to a very smooth operation the unit itself has a very solid feel to it it comes with a modest ' roll of tape i've been able to print quite a few labels with this and i just ordered of the ' replacement cartridges overall really nice job dymo this is a heck of a good value got this for my daughter at christmas she's become very organized and is absolutely in love with this works great so far very good really impressed with this little label maker works very nicely loved this is a very good device it is fairly easy to operate it has some good features for making the labels with different texts and sizes works great used to label sewing room containers this is a great product that i use almost daily to help me label products saving customers from my horrible handwriting works great i had slight trouble with the cartridge at first but figured out i just needed to pull the label tape as it seemed to be stuck after that it worked great there are no instructions and really it's so simple you can figure it out in a matter of minutes i do wish a charging cord had been included but for now i'll use batteries this is a great labeler at a great price it truly is plug and play the device installed automatically on my windows laptop the lite version of the software runs directly from a drive partition located on the labeler the full version of dymo s labeling software is available for download from the dymo website the use of the fonts on my computer is a real plus and being able to put more than lines of text on a label is awesome adding a barcode automatically via the software is a real plus as well as capturing a part of the screen or a graphic file of course there are severe size limitations if you don t need a portable labeler and want versatility then this is for you super cheap at but i m not looking forward to replacing the proprietary battery that is plan to use generic replacements even if it means soldering the connector or throwing it away for i hate america or china whatever this is my second dymo label maker i have one for the house and one for my shop this one is the one i purchased for the shop and it works exactly as i would expect it to the price is great and now i can put labels on various things in the shop my only real complaint is that on some surfaces some plastics from what i've found the adhesive back doesn't want to stick would be nice if that were a bit more sticky on the flip side it's real easy to take off if you need to relabel something so there is that aspect overall a great value this thing is great super easy fast and cheap i can t believe i waited so long to get a label maker you ll be zipping out labels in seconds and it s so intuitive the only complaint i can make is that the labels don t adhere perfectly to every surface so make sure you can tell the difference between your children without them otherwise you probably need this nice deal very handy and helps organize easy to use once i figured out how to get it started using it to label my mason jars with spices and dried goods and my cabinets are looking so organized i have to say i really like this printer i have previously had a brother printer which had a lot of features one of which was eating batteries this dymo printer with rechargeable battery sealed the deal for me very portable but easily typed on makes it easy to carry around to use where i want it i don't use a lot of features other than changing size and orientation and these are easy enough to use recommended does't cut lables on demand wastes a lot of tape at start and end of lable i used this to label my acrylic makeup organizers and it was great i will continue to use this over and over again i also purchased more of the label paper so that i would be prepared in case it ran out the label maker works as described and is very easy to install also to download the software and create labels it just plugs into a powered usb port on a computer which recharges its battery it does as most label makers cut off quite a bit of unprinted tape but no more than any other label maker i've used since it has to be plugged into a computer it's not as portable as the handheld dymo that i had previously but once the software is opened on my computer it's much easier to make labels using my keyboard than the keyboard on a handheld label maker the software lets you insert text an automatic updating counter a few simple shapes and lines barcodes auto updating date and time circular text and addresses from an address book mine came with a dozen addresses maybe someone pre owned my label maker you can also import your own graphics great choices the only problem is i'm using the supplied tape so there's not much room i uploaded and added a photo go a label but it's very tiny still useful software mostly for borders and a good selection of fonts sizes and colors much more versatile than the hand held label maker i'd been using i experimented for quite a while and haven't yet used up the sample tape supplied but i did purchase three extra full sized rolls black on white black on clear and white on clear i thought of purchasing a wireless version but there were too many problems cited in reviews happy for now with this purchase at first this kept saying label jam and wouldn't print at all brand new everything after some searches i learned that you can fix this by removing the print cassette and manually turn the black spool thing clockwise it will be very stiff and require force once you've done this a few times reincert the print cassette and it should work a label maker is an organizational must have and this brand model is a great option for those new to labeling oh the joy i'm so excited for you i already own a brother brand labeler myself and bought this for a friend for christmas i was anxious to compare the two here's the skinny on this dymo cheaper than brother both the unit itself and the tape cartridges intuitive and easy to use love the qwerty keyboard love that it has different outline underline text size and style options love that it doesn't waste nearly as much tape on the sides as my brother model does which can't be changed in settings this is one of the major selling points for dymo over brother in my opinion the tape cartirdges aren't cheap and when so much tape is wasted on either side of your text which i usually just end up clipping off anyway that really adds up hooray dymo the only thing that is lame about this particular model is that it only comes with one font while the description is technically correct i will say that it mislead me to believe that i would be getting multiple fonts when it told me there were font styles i have no idea what they think the difference is between 'font style' and 'text style' but to me a 'font style' is simply a different font and a 'text style' is referring to bold italics etc this feels very misleading and confusing and i am disappointed that there is only one font even or to choose from would be nice that's where my brother wins out but that's the only area everything else about this labeler is fantastic if i had to buy a new one for myself i'd buy this one over the brother in a heart beat hope this helps arrived fast slightly larger than i needed but works great it just works as indented and described the best this is what i always have been looking for it is very easy to use after you read it on line with all the features it has i am still learning and i love what it can do i use it all the time now to label allot of things including my tools pegboard cabinets in the workshop and files in the house product works well i like that there is a self paper cutter love it easy to use works well and is easy to use the keys are responsive and typing is pretty quick not a lot of customization options so stay away if you want different fonts or borders but i use it just to label equipment at work and it gets the job done one thing i don't like is the amount of space it leaves before and after the text on each label but this is a problem on most label makers i've had i have to always trim every label and probably end up with waste on every roll of labels which is annoying this is a great label maker it is compact and easy to use i got it to label my drone with my faa registration number but now i use it on file folders storage boxes and everywhere i can works great great product does the job well works flawlessly and is convenient to use there's nothing i would change about this label maker lots of great features for less than the competition i love my label maker very easy to use easy to replace the tape can change font size number of lines i let my students use it and they love organizing great item very good great tool easy to use very impressed with this unit for the cost it's done a fine job so far i'd almost say i'm going through labels too quickly just because it's so easy to use i've already used this labeler in my closet and pantry it helps keep me organized and hopefully help keep my belongings organized when my tenants use items too very good it's great for keeping bins and miscellaneous items labreled i like this label printer it does what it needs to do it comes with extra things to plug in to your computer i have not tried it yet the printer has different theme font and font size bold text options ect like you would see in word you can change the language save files even has emoji and other symbols to help with label making connects easily to any windows pc and is powered only by usb so no other power adapter needed shows up as an external drive that has mini version of the software dymo label light but i'd recommend downloading the latest full version of the dymo software off the internet if you have a choice as it's a much better interface comes with a small ' starter tape cartridge that will let you test print some labels i've been having some issues with third party tape cartridges printing too lightly the first few times after inserting a new cartridge but i'm not sure that is a problem with the labelmanager pnp truthfully i really wanted the labelmanager wireless pnp instead just for the dpi instead of just dpi for this model but i could not justify the jump up in price there are complaints that it will only work if the rechargeable battery has enough power even when plugged into usb causing issues if the battery dies i have not run into this issue yet this was fantastic the only odd thing is the black ink paper sticks to the label until peeled off but then it s perfect just got it last night made a couple labels and it froze called dymo customer service and got help right away they helped me re set it remove batteries remove tape press the on button times reinsert batteries and tape this did the trick and i hope it's a one time event shout out to good customer service this machine does a great job making labels it's exactly what i wanted it's performance far outweighs the other little observations i have the screen is not lighted so be sure to work in good light keys are smallish but bigger keys would make a bigger machine and this one is a good size as is power cord is inexpensive ish but shipping is just as much making the cord cost almost as much as the machine fonts there are font styles such as bold italic etc but no different fonts it's a plain sans serif which is fine lots of clip art of no interest to me font sizes is a helpful good little machine not giving it stars b c it took the adults several attempts to get the label to come out of the machine bought as gift for tween daughter who wants to organize her stuff fulfills my filing and organizational ocd kind of bulky though the lm is lighter than it looks very user friendly this is my first label maker and works like a charm getting organized just got a whole lot more fun i like that you can print in two lines albeit in somewhat smaller print bc of the tape width limitation change the sizes of the font and add emojis cliparts or a slew of special characters to your label very handy there are lots of tape color options and sizes that pair along with this product to boot the qwerty keyboard is another plus note that it does not come with batteries but aaa batteries aren't too hard to find highly recommend if this is your first label maker and if you only need it for personal use just as good as more expensive brands good unit when available for this label maker is easy to use and easy to load tape paper labels tape are of great quality and long lasting great for labeling wires also used it to label my toolbox in my garage works well best purchase ever had for over a year still love it very good this device does just what i need it to do makes nice clean labels with the ability to print different size fonts keep it simple and it delivered this functionality at the best price great label machine does not come with much label material we needed a label maker and i didn't want to spend too much money because we would not be using it that often we chose this one and it is very easy to use but the batteries die very quickly i was disappointed because i would want to use it and the batteries were dead every time otherwise it is very intuitive and does not waste a lot of tape i do agree with the other reviewers to type out many words at once and then cut them apart with scissors instead of using the cutting tool after every word that does seem to make the tape last longer also buy the a c adapter i finally gave up and ordered it separately once the adapter arrived i really like it i just wish i had really known how bad it was going to be on batteries and i could have bought the adapter at the same time now i am happy with this purchase gave this as a christmas gift to my sister it didn't work out if the box and displayed a message saying it was jammed when it wasn't customer service got back to get though and helped get sort it now it's in good working order and she loves it great hand held label maker several font sizes and label color combinations available very easy to operate works great and easy to use lots of features great to label my items this label maker was perfect for the small project i was working on at home it was easy to setup and use right away it allows you to easily change the size of the font and typing on the keypad is a breeze i learned if the batteries are starting to die the label will come out but nothing will print on the label i think this will come in handy for many future projects and it helped me to get organized the best label printer you can get i bought the hand held one and it said paper jam no matter what i do its not working right returned it for this and it worked like a charm cost same as the hand held one so why not its bomb hahahhah i bought a second one for a friend it works great there is a charging port but i never use it my batteries have been working fine for months great investment this is a fantastic label maker it's so easy to use and the labels look great couldn't ask for better simple to use large print i run this only on the batteries every time i ve needed it it s come alive thank you it's simple to use and the charge lasts a long time ilike that you can change fonts size of fonts and buy different colored tapes it's a great label maker would recommend i regret not buying this a lot sooner it's nice for wiring and labeling but i even used it to monogram our customer christmas gifts you can let it add whatever it wants on the ends of the label you can force the label to be a certain length and you can force it to be more efficient with the margins it adds to the label by printing multiple labels on a single line you can change fonts it will also do the ind labels even though it isn't supposed to works great easy to use and fits nicely in hand comes with supplies makes nice labels with font size option i use this to label my son's school supplies these things are so cheap they are worth picking up i only use it once every couple months which makes it seem like it s jot worth it but when you need to label something quick and easy you re darn glad you have it simple quick easy great for labeling and organizing it has many uses works as advertised and now i am able to label things nicely and professionally my kid loved it and all the extra stuff you can do with it on a computer also very easy to operate and has worked flawlessly so far very good great for labeling things easy to use good product great for organizing ease of use can t stop using it works perfectly for the price didn t work forgot to return work great and is fun to use excellent product for the price simple to use and i love it nice product ready touse right out of the box we have used the brothers brand here for years i have never liked them uses too much tape and painful to change settings wayyyy to many settings hey i just want to make labels bought this dymo love it it is simple to use simple to program and uses much less tape i will never use the brother again it works quite well out of the box especially for the price however i only gave it stars because the download version dymo label v of the sw is not very good it's very slow requires you to bring up saved labels every time you run the sw selecting a label from the list to put in the print box takes about sec no it's not my computer which is very fast on any other tasks great value and love it great for at the office good this is a great product especially for the price i definitely recommend purchasing this item super easy to use and for the price i couldn t ask for anything better great for labeling everything you can pick the direction of the text vertical or horizontal and the size of the font seamless to use love it very neat label maker that comes with many options and a lot of accessories including wall charger usb cable i've been labeling my electronics components so around times cm inch labels and haven't run out of the demo tape yet i have not tried using it with the computer yet as the label maker had the symbols i needed such as mu and omega greek letters for micro fahrads and ohms could be a problem if you have to put decimal points in random places all the time though because you need to go to the menu also i've seen better previews on other devices love this product i love it works very well i am very happy with the labeler dose the job great product great price all you need to do the job i really like my label maker but i wish there was someway of know just how much tape is left on the roll labelled my son's lunch kit waiting to see if it wears away after a few washes this is a good label maker and it does its job but i will say that the tab on the side used to cut each label often gets stuck and i have to force it back out to release the label but otherwise it is great as far as print quality size options and there are lots of symbols to choose from i m a real estate agent i have all of my light switches labeled now great little gadget i m a label freak and love all the options of font style and size works well good value works perfectly and easy to use works well tape isn t very sticky and ink isn t always consistent love this labeler i wasn't expecting it to be such a great product for the price thumbs up i bought this great label maker to label my toolbox now i'm a label master maker lol it's a fun easy item to use thank you for a awesome item works very well would be nice to have an option to export saved labels from pc to device so don't have to connect to pc each time when printing a custom label i like labeling my stuff this product allows me to label my stuff anywhere anytime light and portable easy to use not costly at all as advertised multi line scaled fonts will print horizontally and vertically great for general use however i have yet to master the removal of the adhesive paper from the back excellent quality i'm not using frequently but works great label quality is pretty good there seems to be a common problem with these the first one was unusable it had a jam that couldn't be fixed sent it back and the nd one works great hit or miss with these great product labels not as adhesive as i d like but more to do with the cartridge very nice label maker and the tapes are reasonably priced this works great good value for the price excellent value and functions control over font sizes and orientation of text superior to the old style dymo label maker that embossed into brittle plastic great price dependable we use this all the time for labeling food that we put in the deep freeze great quality and love the fact that we can adjust the font size wastes label material with excessive borders that are not formatable but functions flawlessly for the few items i need it for not for heavy use i suggest a zebra printer for that purpose works great easy to use have not needed frequent charging at all the dymo labels however meh will look for an alternate brand for those i bought them as a package i would not do that again love this product it helps me to get organized with my buffer solutions in the lab amazing features especially considering the price you can write left to right or up and down there are symbols and even clip art so i can do cute umbrellas on my labels for fall clothes or flowers on my spring clothes when packing things away in the garage i kind of just want to label everything for fun now great value easy to install batteries they are not included aaa and install label cartridge would recommend works great works very nice and easy to use have been using it at work and at home works great since i got it with no issues i had for over six months now works as expected big for woman's hand and a bit heavy but great price point and easy to use able to start printing labels right away well once you install the batteries that is most items like this i have come across come with the batteries needed this item does not so be prepared to use aa batteries right off the bat otherwise i would have given this a star rating like it better than the brother yay for organization good well i bought this to replace my brother and well i was just impressed for less than the replacement tape i have got this it hooks to my computer so i can design labels and do it on my computer or laptop or just on the screen i love that flexibility i was also sent a power adapter so i can charge it i last charged it about weeks ago and it is still holding i have to say this was a very good choice for replacing the brother p touch i am thinking of buying more for christmas presents i am really satisfied with good goods choosing the best did the job no complaints until my kids got a hold of it but not the product fault as advertised peeling the label needs work they're obviously selling these really cheap to sell the tape cartridges but the tape is inexpensive and the label maker works wonderfully i bought two and they see a lot of use it's one of those items that you didn't know that you couldn't live without until you get one you're going to wind up labeling everything in your shop pantry garage et cetera comes with one small sample tape great value easy to use would recommend excellent product we use it at church and it works well love it feel so good good awesome definitely recommend easy to use loe it great label maker easy to use i teach fourth grade and this has been life changing i am a very organized person and i encourage my students to be as well we have used this to label all of our classroom art supplies math manipulatives all of the folders they use and all of my files it is so easy to find whatever you might need in my room the labeler itself is very easy to use and has a variety of fonts symbols and sizes highly recommend good product work well the labelmanager doesn't have all the bells and whistles it would be nice to control it throught the computer and have a big screen to write on with an easier keyboard and more options but for my personal needs which are to label a few bins and files spending on extra features is not of much value this basic version has what i was looking for prints quickly and easily labels look professional very clear to read labels adhere well the adhesive backing requires some effort to remove through some trial and error i have found that using tape works well to remove the backing of the labels with a little practice i was peeling off the backing without much hassle by the th label or so the positive of the backing being hard to remove is that if the label resists coming off a surface it is designed to not adhere to it will probably stick strongly to just about anything that needs to be labeled it uses aaa batteries which seems to be a lot from my perspective but all things considered the expense of the label maker with the batteries are a great value for the labeling i intend to do works great get the added label tape you ll want to label everything cost effective label maker that really has limitless uses i downloaded the full program and have made labels with pictures of all kinds like most label makers there is a good amount of tape wasted on each end of the label and there are a few things their program could improve on but ultimately a great deal for the price fantastic product made labels for everything in my house very nice quality needs aaa batteries fits nicely in the hands and has many options to customize labels perfect chrismas gift love this label maker just what i needed nice little thing price was right easy to use good really easy to use for around the house home office and classroom definitely get an extra roll of label tape because the one that comes with this won't last very long this is a great book if you re new to crystals and just want to get started i love the pictures and the wide variety of stones that it includes fantastic book great reference book what a wonderful resource got this for the holidays we recently identified a sample of chrysoprase as easily as looking up a word in the dictionary the

for beginners there is a lot of good information in this little book i'm sure i'll enjoy looking through it however i am slightly disappointed in it i bought the book to help me identify some stones that i have i was hoping there would be pictures perhaps grouped by color so i could compare my stones with the pictures and then be directed to the proper page as it is i will have to go thru it page by page to try to find the stone i'm trying to identify so bottom line good information but not so useful if you want help identifying unknown stones crystals good new condition very useful i chose

you should buy quick easy guide what i was looking for excellent reference with lovely pics love this book very informative wonderful quick reference for both beginner and advanced collectors this book illustrates both the raw and tumbled crystals while giving a brief overview of each crystal's strengths another strength for the crystal bible is that it shares what is and is not safe for crystal cleansing and storage some crystals can't be placed in water and other crystals can't be placed in salt although this book is a wonderful quick resource especially when adding a new crystal to your collection this is a mere jumping off point if you are looking for a detailed nuanced book when researching your crystals this is not the perfect all encompassing purchase they are beautiful this is the best stone book with all information combined except for the mohes scale refractor and other buying indicaters compact and ready to go i use this crystal bible periodically for learning about new ones it contains everyday crystals that you come across this arrived early as well which is super exciting packed packed with information probably more then you'll ever need good information this was a good book great book i have a lot of crystals but i still haven't memorized them this book has a lot of information in it and can get a bit overwhelming at times because it is so thorough but in the end its an amazing reference just as good as the other two excellent guide another good reference book from judy hall if you are nterested in crystals this book is very informative so so sooo glad

crystal properties too judy hall provides the most complete info and photos of stones and crystals in my opinion than any other book out there i own the crystal bible between all i have found every stone or crystal i have wanted to know about all the crystal shops i have been to use judy hall's crystal bibles for reference she is my favorite author of books on stones and crystals judy hall has the most complete useful books and info out there on stones crystals in my opinion for what i'm wanting to know and such a great variety of info on the energy metaphysical spiritual and healing properties of stones i have the crystal bible and every stone i want to know about is in one of these three books you can't go wrong with these books i like this book it pretty much have all the stones in it that i can think of i do wish that there was some sort of color code or form of organization for the stones i can't remember the name of and would like to match other than that it's a really good book very useful learning so much about crystals i have loved rocks all my life and just finding out that these awesome structures are found in our earth i like to know the healing powers and uses eventhough i'm not into that kind of healing i find it very interesting i started collecting crystals now and i really love the polished ones that have a certain feel they truly are magical this book is one of the most extensive books that has been written about gemstones and healing crystals i love it refer to it often great info as expected quick shipping i like it very much great source of info i have the st nd and now the third book by judy hall it is a must have for metaphysical information it is easy to read you don't need to read through the whole information to get to the point i like every book she puts out not all crystals are in this book but there are a second and rd volume good format wiyh good info nice book it is just that a bible for the crystal enthusiast or healer a must have in anyone's library great book i have the first one and really like this second one too it was way smaller than i was expecting but if i had looked at the pictures provided i would have seen how small it was do that's my problem the order was delivered on time and unharmed the book is exactly as described my wife likes it because it is more a pocket size this book is wonderful there is so much info on crystals and gemstones i've never heard of problem is i want to buy more crystals than i ha e money for i wish it had more than crystals or stones was hoping it had more of the rare ones but i was a disappointed to find out a lot of them were listed this cook was very informative awesome resource book very very helpful very interesting and well organized awesome book will definitely always have a spot on my bookshelf pretty much the bible on the subject recommended by my local rock shop exactly what i as expecting easy to use very nice i needed a book that talked about crystals in a more spiritual way as opposed to scientific makeup composition etc this was a really great starter book with easy to understand instructions colorful photos and very detailed descriptions additionally there are sections on how to clean and take care of crystals how to clear energy assist chakra balancing and a glossary of terms if you are looking for a scientific book or if you are already have very advanced knowledge of crystals this book might not be for you but if you are fairly new to crystals and want a good overview this is a really great choice i used my crystal bible at a rock gem show today and it helped me pick out some great pieces handy info for my crystals it has made a collector out of me good the crystal bible is the perfect encyclopedia for the crystal collector religious pagan practitioner or people who love the metaphysical this is my go to when looking for what crystal to use depending on the situation it has over crystals and a lot of information on them such as the availability what they are used for how to use it and different variations of the crystal if any there is also a few sections talking about how to use on your body how to make an elixir and the index in the back is an easy way to find something specific to the ones you'll need they also touch on the types of crystals such as wands generators and points i highly recommend exactly what i was looking for gives picture of each stone in alphabetical order it's healing properties but also has a cross reference in back if your looking for a stone for a particular ailment excellent for beginners this book is amazing and i refer to it all the time i love how it gives you information on how to cleanse and program your crystals and what parts of the house to put

i have enjoyed learning many new things about how to charge and meditate with my crystals lots of info great resource very good value for a standard in the field of gemology and crystal rock effects excellent binding good shipping very pleased quality product so far so good easy to clean high quality heavy pot and pan set worth the money i love cooking the set is just a bit smaller than i imagined but it's actually quite prefect as long as you know how to cook on stainless steel these should be a great addition to your kitchen everything was packed very well and looks pristine the smallest pan has developed blackish stains at the bottom even after proper care with bar keepers friend rest are fine so far after days of use finally a grill for my induction top works great a little hard to clean because you don't want to use anything abrasive and ruin the finish but otherwise im happy to have found this i opted to buy as pieces rather than the factory set so i'll repeat this review under the individual pieces but i'm speaking of the whole collection i put together consisting of one quart and two quart saucepans with lids quart stockpot with lid and inch skillets this is by far the best cookware i've ever owned manufactured very well looks amazing cooks like a dream and cleans up easily it's taken on everything from frying sauteing braising making sauces tomato based and other with no issues if you've not cooked with stainless or are coming back to it there is a minor learning curve for proper use and care but there is lots of info out there to help and the end result is definitely worth it i looked at several sets and manufacturers and in the end i'm glad i spent a little bit more and went specifically with the multiclad pro line i would absolutely do it again i bought this cuisinart pan set as a gift i believe most quisinart products to be a good value i have found their appliances to last and provide expected results from toasters coffee makers and other products i own when i am shopping for this type item i look at quisinart first love the product easy to use and cleas these pots are great they heat evenly we have a gas stove and i wish i had bought these years ago awesome set very good quality and bang for the buck i can't say enough about this brand of cookware i would recommend it over the all clad brand any day this is my second set of cuisinart i had to get the multiclad due to my new stove not being compatible with the percent stainless i just love the look it is so easy to shine up with the barkeep best pots and pans we ever bought great quality and great design beauty and quality at a low price i am extremely happy with this set it conducts heat evenly and perfectly it's easy to clean if needed for major cleanup just use barkeeper's friend to have your cookware looking like new it doesn't weigh a ton which i appreciate i did buy an anolon nonstick skillet specifically for eggs but that is the only supplemental piece i've needed so far i will likely get a dutch oven as well but for the vast majority of my cooking needs this set is fantastic it cooks as well as a friend's much more expensive brand set and is more than worth the very reasonable price it takes getting used to do not turn heat above medium and cook most things on low then does not stick higher heats cause it to stick actually works on a two burner induction cooktop i've made pancakes that actually did heat evenly the heat produced from the two burners spread enough to keep the majority of the pan hot i did have to place the pan at an angle to get the most of each burner also nice that it works in my oven if needed love these pans so many uses will buy again we originally purchased a griddle with the new induction cooktop we had purchased we have never been happy with it to small hard to clean we decided to give this one a try a world of difference larger heats evenly and easy to clean it has worked out perfectly for us a great pan and large enough for of my uses it is a very large pan and weighs quite a bit but the main handle is very sturdy and the helper handle does indeed help quite a bit it disperses heat decently enough for its size although it does take a little longer to heat up initially if you were to have one pan and one pan only this would be a solid choice otherwise i feel like inches is good enough for most purposes if you plan on cooking in bulk for the week like i do inches is definitely the way to go i don't know why it took me so long to get stainless steel pots and pans but i am so happy i did i have a few of these cuisinart multiclad they are hefty which is a good thing i have not had problems getting them cleaned up either terrific these are perfect for my new induction cooktop they are a little heavier than i am used to but very serviceable good heavy pan but the interior discolored the first time i cooked rice very impressed love these good nonstick clean up well cook fantastic we needed a decent frypan saucepan set and after a lot of research purchased this set had no problems with it at all cooks nicely and evenly obviously its not non stick so if you cook too high you can burn your food however once we got used to them they cook great heat is evenly distributed and clean really nicely only negative and its not really a problem with them is that with our cooking we found we need an extra saucepan as there is a small one a medium and a big pot would have liked another saucepan a bit larger than the medium included and maybe a very small one for sauces gravies then it would have been perfect but thats just me nit picking it is not the best most perfect set out there but if you want a good quality and nice to use set than this is probably one of the best value for money sets you can buy very sturdy cooks evenly washes easily excellent product high quality and works perfectly on my induction range got the cuisinart for my son he tried it out the day he got it and was very pleased the chicken he cooked came out very tasty and moist he was going to cook a beef roast next unfortunately i won't be there when he makes it i waited months before this review to make sure it held up its a little on the heavy side but that means good quality i use it at least twice a week and it still looks new i only wash by hand and with bar keepers friend if you need a good quality skillet this is the one for you this is a very cool kitchen toy for cooking soups and gravies i don't know about calling it universal but it fit one qt pot i already owned perfectly didn't fit my qt and is a perfect size between my chocolate melter and my qt double boiler great looking good weight nd solid pan covers excellent pots and pans dishwasher safe and beautiful there is a reason why these are rated the best set online excellent quality i do not own any all clad but it is hard to imagine that they are of significantly better quality than these these are heavy enough to let you know that there really are three layers of metal and not just plating i have used these a few times now if you use them as other reviewers have suggested you will not miss your non stick pans i almost did not buy these i have had a very unhappy experience with cuisinart's customer orbital mixer but these are pots and pans so i figured i was not likely to have to deal with cuisinart's customer service though i do not have experience with all clad they seem to have a good reputation for good customer service plus they are made in the u s a big plus imho the cuisinart cookware is made in france not china and cost about one third what the all clad set costs bottom line if price is a priority for you i don't think you can go wrong with these if not consider the all clad i'm an older millennial that is sick of my hand me downs pots and pans that don't have the correct size lids i decided now that i'm a young professional in a double income house with two kids we needed to step it up and get some nice cookware and have more dinners at home i have been searching high and low for a nice cookware set bonus if it had a steamer i considered the calphalon pc signature set the all clad pc tri ply set and this set i read reviews from numerous sites watch countless youtube videos and decided to take a gamble on the cuisinart multiclad set boy am i glad i did first of all this cookware set feels even more comfortable in my petite hands it's sturdy has some solid weight to it and looks beautiful but how does it cook and clean just as great as you can imagine i learned a great deal on how to cook using stainless steel prior to getting this cookware set and i used my knowledge to the test and the food came out wonderfully the finish is really beautiful i hope it continues to look as beautiful as the years go by with proper wash and care if you are on the fence about this cookware set i say get it it's a great cookware for a phenomenal price and it is much more comfortable than the all clad cookware i'm ' and lbs so i'm not that big of a person i felt the handle on the all clad seemed much longer i bought this set in december and they are fantastic i have had no issues whatsoever with the quality of this set yes they do get stained after using them but household vinegar cleans them up like new i can cook at much lower heat than the set of cookware that these replaced i didn't write a review immediately since i wanted these to stand the test of time they pass i can recommend them without reservation nice pot the only thing i don't like is how heavy it is absolutely love these pans perfect for my glass top stove it doesn't scratch heats to perfection and cleans up really nice can't go wrong these will last forever if taken care of got this for my wife after our similar pot's nonstick coating started to go she has been really happy with it heating is even and quicker than other calphalon pots we have it also looks really sharp she has also been happy with the pouring no drip lip i needed this for my induction cooktop i like the design and quality unfortunately it is to large to fit in the dishwasher except diagonally taking up a complete rack i really liked it but if it doesn't fit in my dishwasher it so i returned it i don't like the handles get hot other than that i love my new pots i loooovvvveee these pots this is my new favorite pot was looking for a replacement after my non stick pot lost some of the coating this is all stainless and works great easy clean up made mac and cheese no mess beautiful pours great without spilling too i love these pans bought a set for my daughter and she loves them so i had to get also my previous pans were marketed as stainless but they failed the test if a magnet sticks it's stainless which these cuisinart pans are my old ones magnet did not stick anywhere they do take a little bit to get used too for they heat up quickly even on a low setting also food sticks but just add some coconut and or olive oil or other healthy oil and your all set do recommend these pans and also suggest you purchase bar keepers friend to help keep them looking brand new and to remove stuck on food pan is great for cooking they cook better with lower temp great cook set replaced our old professional cookware and so far are really happy even hear distribution heavy duty easy to clean very happy with purchase i plan to order more sizes this is a great nonstick fry pan i liked it so much i went back to amazon and purchased another size as well very good quality definitely the best pans i've ever owned why have i been using nonstick all these years this is my rice and mashed potato pot it is the best cookware i have ever owned the multiclad design truly works and i know from cooking rice that this is so because the heat is evenly distributed if it were not the rice would stick to the bottom as it does in any other pan i have used throughout my years of cooking very nice design was the only pan we could get to work adequately on our induction griddle burner it s a long rectangular element on a samsung induction cooktop round pans do not work very well on it do not cook evenly but this seems to work very well even though it s a little bit larger than the heating element the only thing i would change is to make the handles point out rather than up because if you have it on an element that faces the handle forward towards you the handle ends up getting in the way of working on your food handled frying potatoes steak and eggs very well just preheat and add a little lite olive oil nothing stuck and cleaned up with just some warm water dish soap and a sponge some discoloration from high heat and scratching from using metal utensils is to be expected but it s a really enjoyable experience cooking with all metal pans and utensils allows you to just focus on the food and not have to worry about nonstick toxins from using high heat and scratching the nonstick coating no more having to use nonmetal utensils and worrying about the plastic wood or whatever other nonmetal utensils getting melted or burned cooking is fun with metal perfect for induction stoves with synched burners this is an excellent skillet and a remarkable value there is however one problem i purchased one at a local retailer higher price than charged by amazon obviously i am not a verified purchaser as a gift for my daughter a month or so later she informed me that it wobbled enough on her new induction stove that it was virtually useless there was a minor dimple at the center of the bottom that was enough of a convex surface to prevent the necessary total contact with the stove i used softscrub and paper towel to clean it and its gloss was even greater than when new returned it for a replacement delivered the replacement to my daughter and a week later she called to report the same problem i cleaned the second skillet returned same to the local retailer and purchased a more expensive german skillet that is also clad and most importantly for use on an induction stove has an absolutely flat disc on the bottom it works perfectly and my daughter smiles obvious lesson unexcelled for both quality and price but only for use on an electric or gas stove this set is very beautiful i am excited to try it out the pots and pans are heavy which i like love this pan stove top or oven it s perfect i was hesitant about buying these because i have never used stainless steel to cook with before but i'm glad i did i really like these pots and pans and highly recommend them this seemed like a good quality set for the price and arrived well packaged the smallest frying pan had a slight surface defect and was dirty so i suspect it was a factory second on the more subjective side the bottom of the pots were matte finish and i didn't like the look on my pot rack i returned and upgraded to the french made tri ply set which i am delighted with perfect easy to clean fantastic heavy bottom saucepan i prefer the ss cover over the glass exceeds expectations for everything except cooking eggs easier to clean that expected good quality for the price but hard to clean excellent quality my wife loves these excellent sauce pan size is perfect cooks as well as all my cuisinart pans as with all cuisinart pans i cook on medium to low heat cleans up easily i do use a heat diffuser to keep heat evenly distributed and prevent scorching i have a gas range so this is important i did lots of research before deciding on the cuisinart multiclad pro cookware including reading several reviews from research companies i narrowed the decision down to this cuisinart and an all clad in a higher price range based on both my use of the cuisinart for several weeks and the reviews i read this cookware is an excellent value i will recommend using the barkeepers friend soft cleanser to avoid having spots in the bottom of the pans and heat marks on the outside of the pans very good pots i actually purchased a second set i have been using them for over six months my only complaint about these pans is they are almost too beautiful to use say what you like about made in china i'm old enough to remember when made in japan was derogatory uh huh these are well made the finish is superb they have plenty of heft and feel great in your hand i've owned commercial and all clad and i don't feel these are in any way a step down beautiful set have waited my whole adult life to get a nice pan set like these clean up is easy however some pans that get heavy use tend to discolor a bit i ve been using bar keepers friend to help clean them these are super heavy so i wouldn t recommend for anyone who isn t very strong or has upper body or mobility issues this pan was just the right size i have a but it was a bit too small it cooks evenly and is easy to clean it is my favorite go to pan easy to cook with nice mid range pots and pans buy these instead of the style with glass lids you won't regret it one slipup and your glass lid will shatter great pan well made this set of pots pans has turned out to be the best set i've ever purchased they're sturdy clean up easily the handles are easy to grip and they're nice and shiny i love them amazing quality heavy sturdy no stick if you follow the enclosed instructions i can t wait to order more pieces amazing cookware they have a good weight and solid feel i had all clad and replaced them with these i cannot tell the difference other than price got what i paid for just don't cook things at high heat works great for mac n' cheese i'm not enthusiastic about cooking and food in general but i like to prepare my own meals because i'll rather take charge of my own nutritional health than face the consequences of eating mystery food i lie i hated cooking so during this awful co dependent relationship with my kitchen my pots and pans began to die one by one they were horrible to began with the smartest decision i made was to research about decent stainless steel equipment and deciding on these i enjoy cooking now it's not something i'll ever be passionate about but i can live with cooking everyday as long as i have these pots and pans they look sleek neat and reliable and they are the food cooks as it should great even heat distribution so no unevenly cooked dishes half the oatmeal doesn't stick to the sides i've even successfully cooked rice on the stove with these pots cleaning is extremely easy fried eggs don't need to be dosed in oil and painfully scrapped off at the end of the day and if anything sticks too hard simply boil some vinegar and scrub lightly and the rims are beautiful for pouring liquids out of form function and price point are all excellent this is what i call quality engineering converted my stove top over and lost my built in griddle this is a great replacement that heats very well on a glass stove top good set and works well with our induction cooktop i like these a lot but recommend reading and following the guide many of them are too small so i ended up ordering a large casserole style saute pan as well as a cuisinart nonstick inch skillet they are great if you're cooking for people every day but if you are trying to meal prep you will need to order additional pieces they do discolor if you use heat too high which i did and hopefully barkeepers friend and more scrubbing will clean them up again i've only used it a few times but so far its fantastic we'll see how it does after a year though awesome cookware i have a new glass top stovetop the base on these are very heavy and does not scratch my top easy to clean you do need to put hot soapy water in it as soon as you are finished cooking i absolutely love the pots and pans they are very durable they clean up so nice would definitely gift them gift recipient says it is wonderful love it so far very sturdy not like my last pot haven't had it very long but i expect it to last a long time just based on its construction good size love it beautiful sturdy and easy to use if you follow the instructions great quality at a great price perfect size for my camper i love it great for stove top double burner really like these pots and pan very think solid good quality look nice i bought a set several years ago and they are very nice looking and feel sturdy cooking with them was great even heating and no sticking after cooking with them i noticed that many things were beginning to stick i had to polish the surface back to a glass like condition to keep food from sticking and no i didn't use utensils that would scratch the bottom a word of caution don't use those yellow and green sponges to clean these pots and pans use the two tone blue ones the green and yellow are extremely coarse and will scratch the you know what out of the pans after needing to change my cookware after putting in an ge induction stove top i was overwhelmed with all the things to look at in the needed cookware i had always used nonstick and the leap to stainless induction cookware could be pricey as much as i wanted the most expensive u s brand i went with these from the ratings to make the transition to learn on as i am a very impatient person and clean up has to be quick and easy for me i am so happy i went with these they feel and look high end and even sparked the interest of my hubby guy friends who usually could careless about pot and pan wish they were a little bigger for the amount of cooking i usually do overall the quality is great and work great the handles can become hot which is unfortunate compared to my older pots and pans bought this on a special deal waited quite a while for delivery but was warned when i ordered that it would take nearly weeks for delivery i am overjoyed with this pan heating cooking food is easy but you have to learn to use a lower heat level as the pan heats quickly and holds heat i have never burned food nor has any food stuck to the inside of the pan the handle does stay cool as advertised as does the handle on the lid i would buy this pot again in a minute looking for the comparable set at this time to purchase probably don't know how to use the skillets everything sticks but love the rest of the set i didn't cook much food tasted bland with this set i cook every day and the food tastes wonderful i am a very satisfied customer we enjoy using these pots i've been using these a few weeks now and i have yet to have any problems using them or cleaning them the only time food stuck was when my boyfriend used the frying pan and had the heat too high he didn't realize how well these conduct heat for a gas range i don't need it any higher than medium low and he was using medium high if you have issues with sticking be sure to let the pan heat up before adding any oil or food to it but don't have the heat too high because a you will burn your food and b it will stick cleaning has really been a cinch after cooking in it let the pan cool down a bit put some hot water and deglaze the bottom of the pan i like to just use the utensil i cooked with not metal and scrape around the bottom of the pan with the water in it within seconds the bottom of the pan is clean of food and the pan just needs to be scrubbed and put away i do not have a dishwasher so i wash all of these by hand and the people complaining about difficulty cleaning these are ridiculous in terms of residue on the bottom of the pans that won't come off with soap and water these are stainless steel that happens from time to time i have a stainless steel work top that also gets the same type of residue it is easy to get off with some vinegar and baking soda or bartenders friend best cookware i've ever owned what a difference having a decent set of pots and pans make i pre heat and don't go above medium heat settings and haven't had any issues i particularly like how they distribute heat evenly they also clean very easily but i'm careful not to use anything abrasive if these are treated properly i see them lasting for decades i haven't had any issues with food sticking which pleases me because my last set of pots and pans had the non stick coating which wore off all i need to do is keep these polished and use a little cooking spray and it's perfect every time great quality i purchased the set and was so impressed i added this quart cici dodson indianapolis in great cookware this pan is great deglazing works great handles do get really hot other than that it s a great pan works well in oven a little expensive after adding the shipping otherwise a good buy this is intended as a wedding gift for my son in law that is getting married in march very good but still sticks a lttle wife likes it i like her cooking in it happy wife happy life these pans really let you get control of your cooking by providing even heat through the inner layer compared with my old aluminum pans they take a little longer to heat but once hot they use much less power i didn't think they would make this much difference we cooked white rice and due to the great seal of the lids it came out as great as with a rice cooker you will need to put some healthy fat in the pan like olive oil so that food doesn't stick cleanup is just as easy as with our old ceramic pans and they avoid the use of teflon coatings which we will someday realize are responsible for us not living past years note that these pans are heavier than traditional aluminum pans why not get your workout in while making a delicious dinner perfect addition to my set much lower cost than at local retailer came in original box i've used it several times with no problems love this set and i like that the lids are not glass more sturdy did a lot of research before investing in a stainless steel set this is by far the best bang for your buck at this price range it is an absolute steal i cook regularly and this set is absolutely amazing would recommend mcp series products are very nice have a cuisinart larger pot as well and i just love them heavy construction flat bottom large size fit a lb turkey easily rack works great pan and rack have large oven mitt friendly handles super value it is reasonably easy to clean and heats evenly i have a propane stove and put the burner on lower heat with this pan than other pans i have used saves money i like the pan love this pan bought the complete set first and added this extra pan these pans work best on my glass top stove others have warped but these are still level on the stove very well made cookware beats paying x as much for a name brand they are copper lined on bottom and up the sides for even heating like top name brands awesome my wife loves it great pot very useful great skillet for cooking eggs and other small items nonstick surface very effective we bought a smaller cook set because the larger sets did not have nonstick skillets and we re glad we got this one love this pot used it to make caramel worked like a charm this griddle works wonderfully on my induction cooktop especially as i have a bridge that links two burners great size non stick coating and cleans up well wonderful product very pleased with skillet satisfactory in every way found this pan to be the perfect size for people it heats up really well really quickly which is essential as i have an old crappy electric coil stove top i m a terrible cook but this pan has managed to survive me burning everything in it after cooking i soak the pan and then throw it in the dishwasher sometimes it comes out a bit discoloured but this doesn t affect the cooking for really bad burns stains discolouration i hand wash using bar keepers friend cannot stress how much you need to have this product cleans the pan back to pristine newness works great on our induction cooktop really like the no stick finish perfect size for what i was looking for i needed a soup pot and pot for cooking pasta the quality is great too nice pan great for braising a bunch of proteins i wish it had a bit of a domed lid but that is a very small potential issue overall i would buy again a great pot for cooking oatmeal it does not stick when you wash it afterward the heat spreads evenly over the bottom of the pot and everything cooks uniformly no hot spots and the sides stay cooler than my old stainless steel pot that too makes it easier to clean it is a bit heavy the price you pay to get the other benefits for the size of the handle i love it and my wife loves it wow just received it n already loving it absolutely beautiful set love them super heavy which comes with the superb qualities that make this set professional just hope i don't have to buy a cheaper lighter weight brand when i get older because i love love these a little bon ami is your co worker with these we love this pan if we had a need for other sizes right now i'd go ahead and order cooks evenly quickly and cleans easily works great so far great sturdy pot for sauce and smaller batches the quality of this product is great you were out of stock at one point but i waited for these pots and pans because they have such a great review cuisinart multiclad pro is superior quality i have several pieces and all of them function very well without pitting and or discoloration i use them on medium low to medium temperature i have pieces almost years old i use them a lot and they still look like brand new out of the store i never put any of my cookware in the dishwasher good value good quality easy clean food cooks evenly had to buy non stick fry pans for eggs and some other foods overall very pleased it s really very good to use and easy to clean great quality heats well cleans well nice weight i love this product heats and cooks evenly if anything gets stuck on soak pan and it cleans up beautifully i hate buying in sets you never really get all the pieces you want the pans and pots have been great for me it's tough to find comparable pieces in stores for this set but would be awesome to have a saute pan and double boilers or steamers in the set the small saucepan is great i use the saucepans the most and the stockpot the least with the frying pan occasionally when i don't feel like waiting on my cast iron overall a great investment good heavyweight stainless pans they work well on gas burners and i ve found them to also perform well on induction burners i have them in qt to qt saucepans with lids and a covered quart casserole they heat evenly and are thick enough to retain their heat there are certain instances where they benefit from soaking before cleaning but all in all they clean up very well are they as good as top quality all clad no of course not but then again they re a fraction of the cost i m and my days of elaborate cooking and entertaining are so few and far between it s hard to justify spending on a set of cookware a few years ago i started buying the multiclad pro to replace my decades old deteriorated pieces of le creuset i ve liked them enough that i also recently bought them when i needed pots and pans for a second home i've had this set for a few months now and i really like it you could feel its high quality build made from its weight and craftsmanship it's definitely not as easy as cooking on non stick pans but the heat is consistently spread out i did have some occasions where food debris was stuck so i had to soak the pans for a couple of hours before washing it another thing would the the solid lids since i can't see through and get a good look i would have to open and check which releases heat from the pan other than that i can't complain much about it so far so good slightly heavy i like this skillet it did warp a little bit but my husband fixed it for me haven't had any more problems with it great weights more than expected but i lift weights feels like it will hold up problem with most reviews is that they are done after one week you should fololw up months after purchase very high quality thick very like them i love cooking with this even heat easy clean up i cook for a larger crowd regularly and i had come to the point of needing a few extra pieces to complement my all clad d set however i was not prepared to pay all clad prices a second time round so i decided to go for this set which was less for the set than the all clad stockpot alone to be honest i only realized that there was a piece set after receiving this one and maybe that was lucky as i would have ordered the smaller set had i seen it before but now i am happy to have the set so comparing the two sets yes the all clad is better quality sturdier heavier easier to clean but the difference is small and at this stage i am not sure it's better once you learn how to cook with stainless steel both sets perform beautifully for everyday cooking i am not seeing much difference between the two the cuisinart one still cleans nicely even though it might take a bit more soaking for burned on food it reacts very nicely to bar keeper's friend for more difficult stains the shiny inside surface makes me nervous for scratches but no evidence of such yet i am sure they will eventually appear but honestly i don't care as much the lids are much lighter than the all clad ones not sure that it matters though compared to my other set this one seems to have less surface and more height making it more appropriate if i am cooking smaller quantities i find myself reaching for it if i am cooking for or people it's beautiful happy to see it hanging on my rack the different sizes are the main reason i am happy i ended up buying the piece set as it gives me more flexibility in choosing the appropriate size for the job at hand i would think that the cuisinart version is possibly better than the all clad if you are routinely cooking for people the all clad may be better if cooking for not that either set couldn't handle any amount of people in that range for myself i see that i am reaching for what i thought was going to be my backup set more often than i thought i would and even though i can tell the all clad is better quality the difference is not such that would impact my day to day cooking of course longevity my all clad set is close to years old with no signs of wear remains to be seen i requested this skillet as a christmas gift and based on nearly two months of use so far i'm finding it meets my needs i have been using it at least once a week and it cooks well and cleans up nicely i let the pan cool soak it and haven't had to use bon ami too often to remove more stuck on food the multiclad construction allows the skillet to heat evenly and the food cooks evenly the only issue i've encountered is due to the unevenness of the burners on my electric stove i have to move the skillet around a bit on the cooking surface which tilts significantly which is of course the fault of the stove top not the skillet there has been a marked improvement in the meals i've prepared using this skillet over the older not terribly good pans it's replaced the long handle is angled well stays cool for handling and makes it comfortable to maneuver the skillet during cooking and serving the helper handle is a great and necessary addition for lifting and moving the pan the lid is designed well and fits well i'm pleased with the size features maintenance and functionality of this pan good price good product it's a joy to cook with it it works pricey yes but totally worth it i am completely enamored with this set this is my first stainless steel pot set and i couldn't be happier i do a lot of cooking and so far so good this set is holding up strong the inset steamer was a definite buy for me not only can you use it to steam foods but i use it as a strainer too perfect i love this it's heavy durable and works so well i use this every chance i get i decided to invest in a pan that is more costly than my usual cookware and now i'm hooked well worth spending extra for such a high quality product it makes cooking even more enjoyable love this pot its easy to clean it s heavy duty will probably last a lifetime i have the one size down from this also i like that the lids are interchangeable well made beautiful griddle that works well on my ceramic glass top stove cleans easily nice weight good size very satisfied with this product it's worth the buck and so easy to clean excellent pan i have bought cuisinart over years i have all sizes now this is a beautiful multi clad pro pot especially for large quantities of pasta the core conducts the heat evenly and you can cook at a lower temperature easy to handle with handles and has a beautiful shin that lasts for years i recommend this product it is equal to the all clad which are much more expensive this is a terrific buy very nice pans good value for the money very nice quality pot heavy and well made this is great for pancakes i feel like making flapjacks every day it can easily fit three pancakes the size i make the only downside is that the handles are a little too high shorter would be better the range top of my ge gas range has a panel in the rear which juts out preventing this griddle from being centered front to rear non stick is really slick i guess it's dishwasher safe but it's so easy to clean i just do that in the sink wow this pot is taller then i expected and the width is almost the same as my qt pot and really heavy i cut my finger when washing along the rim so be careful that edge is sharp glad i bought it amazing pan before this we were using crappy stainless steel saucepan my life has completely changed now this was recommended by america's test kitchen as their nd option as we didn't opt for the st option all clad since that was way too expensive the quality of this pan and weight of it is amazing this cookware far exceeds my expectations awesome set i love love love these pans i would highly recommend we are completely overjoyed with this cookware set it arrived carefully packaged each piece has a heft and weight to it and it's marvelous to use for cooking and cleans up beautifully the lids are interchangeable so that all pieces have tops that fit well we'll get a lot of use out of this product thank you to cuisinart and to amazon and their suppliers for a superb product i could have spent this much on one or two pieces elsewhere easily i like these pans as well as my old all clad pans wife uses this at school in her culinary class great price this cuisinart set is so beautiful and works like a charm you won't be disappointed with this purchase beautiful set looking forward to many years of use make sure you use a pot hold to open the lids they get hot love these pots do not cook on high heat as this is not necessary food taste great and healthy for you high quality nicely finished perfect for glass top stove cuisinart has always been my favorite brand name in cookware these pans do not disappoint the stainless steel bottom is a good weight so the pan doesn't slide on the cooktop while i'm cooking and food doesn't stick without spray or oils i love these pans great pot cooking even all of my kitchen counter top appliances are cuisinart products so i knew the quality of this product would be top of the line it was time to purchase new cookware after moving into a home with a glass top electric stove top my well used copper bottom cookware was not working with this change and after investigating the efficiency and even heat cooking of the stainless steal cuisinart my search was over i am very happy with this cookware's ability to quickly and evenly cook what ever i am cooking and clean up is a breeze you won't be disappointed with this product i have the whole set of cuisinart pans i wanted both types of skillets plain and non stick since i use them for different dishes exactly perfect very nice heavy coating and a lifetime warranty my wife seems to like them she was wanting a nice set of stainless to get away from teflon she's commented several times on liking them so far stainless is a bit harder to clean than the teflon but we knew that so far so good love cooking on these items nice pan that does a good job i'm happy with this purchase hi quality and solid design this pan is awesome and i am using it often this is a very heavy pan and large which was needed have electric stove and it does take longer to heat up but worth it i bought this for my wife as she was looking for griddle for our induction stove of the stove top griddles out there are aluminum clad griddles which won't work on induction stove tops easy to cook with and easy to clean up excellent quality impressed i do my worst to these things and they take it all copper scrub brushes metal utensils they still look great i love the fact that i can dig the stuck on stuff off and not worry about any non stick surface cuz stuff still sticks to those go figure i am very pleased with this set they are nice heavy i cooked my first beef roast heat was even the roast was perfect can cook like a chef with this set i recommend it these are great pans clean up beautifully i have a gas stove and wanted durable cookware awesome pans i have a set and we got my mother a set for christmas great quality even heating i've written several reviews over the years about the cuisinart multiclad pro line calling them the equal or superior to their calphalon and or all clad counterparts this pan continues the tradtion and in fact its lead has grown in my view i bought the calphalon tri ply pan a few weeks before this one i was disappointed at how cheap feeling they have become the aluminum middle layer looks to be barely mm thinck and the pan weighs just g oz although it performs reasonably well i needed a nd pan as i'm eliminating non stick entirely from my cookware collection so i ordered this one from amazon the cuisinart pan looks gorgeous and feels as hefty as i would expect it weighed in at g oz heavier than the calphalon the aluminum layer looks to be more than twice as thick looking at the outer edge and the pan performs exactly as its multiclad pro siblings in my collection do perfectly as with other pans in this line including saucepans the pouring lip is a welcome improvement over say the all clad pans with no lip the handle is also easier on the hands when lifting the pan overhand which i do because it's more natural for me although it uses tennis player muscles that a lot of people don't have overall a great pan at a terrific price i see no reason whatsoever to spend all that extra money for the big brands fyi i've generall had no issues with quality control for these mcp pans the one time i received one a qt saucepan with a bowed bottom such that it wouldn't sit flat on a flat surface it was promptly replaced no questions asked food cooks evenly cleans easily but has spots that don t wash away preformed as expected i purchased this for my daughter as a christmas gift she absolutely loves the weight and feel of these pots and pans i have been looking for two years for a griddle that would work on my new induction cooktop this one is great on my two burner bridge the bottom is completely flat for a solid connection it heats well and evenly and cooks like a dream the handles are tall enough to stay cool during most cooking it is non stick and cleans up nicely i hand wash this item highly recommended for induction cooking i love this cook wear it is heavier than i thought it would be i have a set of stainless steel cook wear that i purchased about years ago and paid a lot more for it than this set the quality of this is just as good great buy great set of pans my wife loves them seem to be well made the finish does attract finger prints just use micro fiber to remove bar kepers products help clean after cooking i keep looking for a stainless steel skillet i can afford which does not stick this is better but bacon still wanted to stick i have been using this set for about a week now and am very happy with it coming away from the non stick world i was a little intimidated at first but after watching several cooking with stainless steel videos i felt ready first things i cooked were eggs and bacon no problems everything cooked evenly also these pots and pans are very handsome and feel quite sturdy in your hand i think i'll be keeping these a while i have all clad at home but didn t want to spend that much on our second home this set cooks almost as well as the all clad i also like the selection of pieces in this set though this is a small condo and it s usually just two of us i enjoy cooking for family this set covers just about everything i need had to buy a non stick pan for either scenario the steamer is a nice piece to include the only issue is that it gets the rainbow effect it comes clean easily with barkeeper s friend but it seems to occur much quicker than with the all clad and i deducted a star for that wish i could have deducted just half a star especially since it could be related to climate and the all clad is in virginia and this product is in san diego so far these have been fantastic pots and pans the metal handles do get hot though so be careful i use a little bar keepers friend cleaner every time i clean them and they continue to look brand new the pots and pans are pretty heavy with feel solid i wish i would have replaced my old cook set a long time ago you will be hard pressed to find a better set for the same cost well worth it looks good and cooks great this cookware set is well worth it it has fully clad structure just like all clad but at a fraction of the price i own other all clad pans and can safely say that the cuisinart is at least of all clad's performance they heat evenly and cleans easily as long as you use them properly also the selection in this set is great for a small household people i have to admit that the look is a little utilitarian not as nice as all clad but actually more functional since all pots and pans in this set have a rolled lip for drip free pouring while in all clad very few have it as a side note in some other reviews it was mentioned that the rivets are easily corroded which worried me a little before purchasing however i can happily say that it's not the case any more for the current batch version all rivets on the pan except the steamer insert and all lids are now stainless steel instead of aluminum i guess cuisinart listened to the reviews and made the improvement overall a high value cookware set that will last you years to come enjoy cooking i bought this set two months ago and have waited a bit to post a review to make sure i had a chance to live with it for a while we had just purchased a new stove with true convection oven and ceramic radiant burner cooktop on reading the manual i found that most of my stovetop cookware was not recommended for use with this cooktop my pots and skillets either had ridges on the bottom painted surfaces or both even the copper bottom set i have had for years was not recommended for use with high heat not willing to take a chance on ruining the cooktop i decided to invest in a whole new set of cookware and spent a lot of time online reading professional chef websites and anywhere else i could find reviews for the recommended products for my new stove the cuisinart multi clad pro products consistently scored high there are similar cuisinart products that are stainless steel but are not multi clad i made my final decision after reading an article dated march on best cookware for glass top stoves at a website called onthegas org this article gave their top five picks and the cuisinart multiclad pro set was at the top of the list on receiving the cookware i was impressed with the beautiful appearance and the weight of the cookware it simply looks and feels like professional cookware there are many products that cost more much more but i am cooking for my family and considering the excellent warranty offered on this product i felt it was a great buy for the price it heats quickly and evenly the helper handles remain cool and it cleans up beautifully some reviewers have mentioned spotting on the inside surfaces but this cleans up with a little vinegar and even so does not impair the functionality of the cookware i gave away the cookware that was not recommended except for the revere ware copper bottom set i received as a wedding gift in the 's it's okay to use as long as you don't use high heat i have since purchased a couple of other pieces in this line and i am just as happy with them i needed a shallow roasting pan to use with the convection roast bake oven setting i got the large lasagna pan with roasting rack since the multiclad pro set did not include a nonstick skillet i ordered the inch non stick skillet i plan to buy the tri ply nonstick double griddle not in the multiclad line but similar this cookware is a joy to use i have always considered myself a pretty great cook but the results i am getting with my new stove and cookware have really upped my game and i am having fun trying new recipes and techniques very nice i am a man who likes to cook and very pleased with the product well made and has large non stick area for eggs bacon pancakes etc cleans well in dishwasher but does take up a lot of room product is good but expensive wife like it thermal efficiency compares well with all clad at less than half the price it's a no brainer ordered from melbourne and delivery was efficient good alternative for iron clad great quality and durable i love these so worth the money these are well made and seem like the kind of thing that could last forever we re keeping our larger stock pot and larger pan though as we still want something a bit larger for large dishes and stews excellent beautiful high quality stainless cooks like a dream i hesitated on this purchase but am so glad i moved forward i love the pots pans love the fact that the handles don't get hot while cooking awesome well made stainless steel pot for cooking anything works great this pan is induction ready for my new electric induction stove be sure to read the fine print if you need induction ready because many of them say stainless steel but the cladding prevents usage on an induction stove this pan cleans up very well and should last forever after second use the pan warped rocked back and forth on my ceramic stove top but three taps on the outside center with a rubber mallet fixed that and has been a great pan ever since then heats evenly when you learn how to use properly it is nonstick it is one of my go to pans every day since then i have bought three more pieces love them these pots and pans are impressive when you spend your whole life using t fal pots and pants you don t realize what your missing until you cook with a real cookware like this these pots and pans are heavy duty one pan weighs like pounds they look beautiful and perform really well for not having a non stick coating my wife was hesitant about it at first but now she s very protective of her pot set she will spend hours scrubbing it clean to keep it looking brand new that s something she s never done before awesome saucepan made a perfect batch of rice was great for making a roux to start gravy highly recommend it cooks evenly perfect size easy clean up we have had our set of cuisinart multiclad pro for over years and still love them they have preformed excellent over the years they still look great and clean up easily one of the best buys i have ever made seriously looking forward to many more years of use love this griddle i have an induction cooktop with a bridge and this griddle makes it a breeze to cook bacon french toast eggs grilled sandwiches etc gave as a gift great product good price this is a beautiful set and i have enjoyed it but if you have trouble with your hands be aware that this cookware is a bit on the heavy side especially the larger pieces when full of food also if you are used to using cookware with clear lids this might be an adjustment for you it was for me anyway but then i can't break these lids remember that the handles do get hot fast i especially like the large deep skillet that comes with this i have discovered that things don't stick if i spray the pan with a cooking spray like pam first some folks have had no sticking problems so i'm guessing it's just me and my cook top runs a bit hot if you want to keep this looking brand new all the time get the bar keepers friend and liquid cleaner and the cleaning cloth works beautifully after doing extensive research on cookware after a mishap with porcelain enamel cookware rachel ray which looks nice but is not practical for everyday use we decided to go with these first impression was the weight of each piece they re heavy not unbearably so but a testament to their quality seared fish on first use and it was beautiful if you re looking for quality everyday cookware these are amongst the best it was exactly as advertised the lip of the pans prevent drips and it cooks food evenly i love the look of the brushed steel i just wished they had more mix and match pots i didn't need the frying pans but would like some different sized pots do not mind giving a star rating but no time to chat after years of only buying non stick pans i finally got sick and tired of the non stick becoming 'stick' i was a little apprehensive about going with stainless but have found it to be amazingly easy to clean even when food does stick and one can actually 'cure' your pan to make it 'less sticky' overall i am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this particular set bought it at a great price very good quality heats evenly love the look hope that it last for years and years to come i should note that i have had the set for about a month and am grateful for previous reviews as they were all helpful in making a decision to purchase this particular product i just got a new induction cooktop i have had this set for years using a gas range it does tarnish easy but it's no drip pour edge kicks butt and i love it i just bought a second set i kind of wish a replacement pan would be less expensive than almost over the price of a new set but whatever most of qa's products are top notch and for less money than the high end brands this is a great set thank you we love it surprised my wife for christmas with this set amazingly awesome love my new cuisinart cookware if treated properly it is virtually non stick i've made pancakes fried pork chops and chicken prepared rice and pasta it distributes heat evenly and makes cooking so easy i did read on how to cook and care for my stainless steel cookware cooking on lower settings makes a huge difference also best to keep a bit of barkeepers friend on hand if you find that you get some bluing just add a very small amount of vinegar to the pot pan and it's instantly gone i just wipe it around the pot with a paper towel and quickly rinse it off my pots and pans look like new i'm also ordering a set for my son and his wife love love love this pan the high polished finish is practically non stick though i did use some oil wife needed this to sear steak so she is very pleased with the pan high quality easy to clean my job so all is good love these pans they do take some getting used to if you are used to using non stick but have worked great for me this is a well made pan it cooks food evenly and is very easy to clean i'm glad i bought it as i use it almost every day as expected beautiful i love this set bought a few of these pans separately then when this set was on sale i bought it very durable great more food faster this was a christmas gift they love it stainless steel is way better than nonstick spend a little extra for quality cookware that will last forever the lids close tightly to keep moisture in i can cook fish and finish steaks perfectly with these no more overdone and dry food for me the only downside to these is that you can't see when water is boiling inside the steam just starts coming out also these work on induction cooktops i really struggled to find the right cookware for my new glass cooktop i did lots of research on brand names as well as material the pots are heavy which i like because they don't move around on burners cusinart has a good reputation and stands by their products so that was another reason i chose this set very happy we've had these for a little over a month now and we love them we bought them to replace a year old set of farberware non stick pans follow the directions carefully for cleaning and care and they stay lovely perfect size stay cool handles easy clean up looks beautiful amazing value and truly exceptional performance for radiant stove tops overall the pots have met our needs very well food does stick more than i'd like but we really like the heavy duty feature a couple of ours have formed an odd residue that won't wash away but this hasn't been a problem this set was literally just what we needed to meet our daily cooking routine bought for my son and his wife they are thrilled with the set began using it immediately they love the performance great pan to add to our collection its actually an addition to the set we wanted a second pan love everything about it except i have to learn how to fry potatoes in it without sticking these were a christmas for my son in law i bought him a and a qt he picked them out in advance he says he loves it this appears to be well made substantial cookware have not had a chance to use all the pieces yet but i am sure they will all be needed in time my initial issue is that although this was all packaged in one box every lid had a sticker on it that simply will not all come off the glue must be old i rubbed it with my fingers with ice with a sponge soaked it in warm water etc and there is still residue why put a sticker with the product name on every lid in a boxed set must have been a decision by someone who never unpacked one of the boxes really detracts from the initial beauty of the product good product arrived on time omg i cannot sing the praises of this cookware enough it's still relatively new to me but i've loved using it other than not being great for eggs though the deep did a fab job w a frittata in the oven i'm amazed at how evenly things like meat cook plus i have to keep the heat low the pans heat quickly and thoroughly i literally never go above a out of on the controls except for boiling water and that i set on an i have an old fashioned cheap tiny apartment oven and this cookware still makes my food taste like a pro cooked spend the extra few dollars this stuff is beautifully crafted and will last for a lifetime of healthy cooking along with a lifetime guarantee it's a steel gave this to my husband as a gift for his camping bushcrafting needs and he loves it it is bottom heavy and brings water to a boil very quickly much faster than our other pots great products expensive but worth it these are awesome we went back and forth between getting all cast iron or a stainless steel set both have pros and cons but being able to throw these in the dishwasher after a large meal sealed the deal for us we were trying to eliminate our aging teflon set and wanted to replace them with something more durable and less likely to leech into our food extremely high quality food sticks a little more than teflon but these are not cheap pans where everything burns and becomes impossible to clean everything so far has rinsed off easily after letting in soak in hot water for a few minutes expect to have these a lifetime i bought this set in it is still as beautiful as the day i opened the box this was my first foray into stainless and i'm pleased i made the jump i've recommended this set many times the last couple years i always get compliments from guests just as described great price very nice after much research on cookware and asking my chef friend who recommended all clad which was too expensive i decided that the cuisinart multiclad pro would be the best choice it has the tri ply construction stainless steel with aluminum core which also goes up the sides the lesser expensive sets are only tri ply on the bottom which truly makes a huge difference in even and thorough heating and cooking the set arrived and not only is it nice to look at the cooking is phenomenal when i read reviews that this cookware would make a difference in how food tastes i did not believe it so game on i made soup stock and it is the best stock i have ever made when my boys commented on how great it was i knew that the cookware does make a difference i was hesitant to cook eggs because of some of the reviews saying that they stuck if you follow some basic rules the cookware performs outstandingly the eggs were perfect and nothing not even a smidgeon stuck to the pan here are the key rules i am following with great success never heat above a on a point scale for heat half of your top setting i promise you will be able to sear and brown and saute like a champ heat the pot pan before adding butter or oil this is the key to not having anything stick to the cookware for eggs i used butter amazing results i was going to buy a couple of non stick pans for eggs but do not need to with these results i do not put mine in the d w i need to get some barkeepers friend for the few spots but so far they clean up beautifully for those who have posted negative reviews or had bad outcomes this cookware requires a change in cooking styles methods and finesse to achieve successful results i truly believe that if you follow the rules posted you will be love this cookware as well as saving lots of money over all clad or other professional quality cookware bon appetit this pan is beautiful cooks evenly i use it all the time even though it doesn't have a non stick surface it's very easy to clean very nice sauce pan it is made very well and the handle is wide enough to allow you to control it while pouring purchased after much research and is an excellent choice replaced my caphalon top of the line and happy i did arrived on time and well packed good quality like the appearance i like reviews by people who have used the product for a few months and this is one of those we have been using this cuisinart multiclad pro set for almost one year this cookware is lovely it is nice and heavy and holds the heat very well i loved the way the pots looked right out of the box in addition the skillet handles stay cool but the lid handles do not however you must read the care and use instructions a lot lot lot of butter or oil is necessary to prevent the food from hopelessly sticking to the pan and this is my biggest complaint clean up can be a challenge if you want the cookware to look nice any little food sticking to the pan after cooking was a challenge to remove although soaking for a few minutes is helpful i found that bar keepers friend with a soft sponge works better than the recommended bon ami the bar keepers friend even works on greasy pots even if you are only cooking green beans in water you might be tempted to simply rinse out the pot but it will not be clean enough also dry the pots and lids right after washing otherwise there will be spots that said i still love the cookware and hope you will too great solid product no way you can get anything better for the price i gave this as a gift to my sister for her birthday she loves them she appreciates that the handles do not get hot and that they are not too heavy i would recommend these pots and pans i decided to wait for a while to write this review as i wanted to use them for at least a few weeks prior to rating and reviewing keep in mind this is my first set of stainless steel cookware i've ever used so i can't really compare them to other stainless steel sets i've only used numerous types styles of non stick sets teflon ceramic green pan copper chef etc i've never actually bought a set of cookware until i bought these all of the others have been gifts of some sort i was trying to decide between these or a set that calphalon were heavily discounting at the time a set with copper on the outside stainless on the inside aluminum core but out of all the comparisons and other reviews i chose these instead mainly because the copper would most likely tarnish and get unevenly ugly also america's test kitchen tested sauce pans the winner being all clad of course was well out of my price range their next recommendation though was the cuisinart multiclad unlimited and i figured those should perform similar to these pros stainless steel with care will last a lifetime and more heats very evenly and quickly the tapered rim really does make pouring much easier and practically drip free i always have a paper towel handy regardless cooked eggs without sticking yeah you read that right cooking is much more predictable cons the cookware do stain but can be removed must be very diligent with proper preheating and not overheating parts of the cookware is a high mirror polish more on why i put this as a con later could be sensitive to temperature shock but then again most if not all cookware is first i'll tackle the cons stains can occur on the cooking surface especially if you get some stuck food some food sticking is normal it's called fond don't be discouraged by it after giving it a good soap and water bath with a plastic scrub sponge i've noticed light colored whitish marks on the cookware honestly this isn't a problem but it does trigger my ocd to want the pans to look clean nothing a little bon ami bar keepers friend can't fix just don't really recommend doing this often as these are minor abrasives this leads me to mirror like finish in spots i honestly wish all of the surface had the brushed look to it once you use bon ami bar keepers friend on the upper parts of the cooking surface or elsewhere you'll get swirl marks this is just once again my ocd of wanting to keep my brand new set looking brand new they will scratch and get swirls and other stuff but the mirror finish only makes it that much worse it obviously won't change the performance of the cookware preheating overheating these pans can heat up quick ymmv depending on your stove type mine is electric with exposed element even on medium because of this you really need to make sure you aren't overheating the pan while preheating overheat can will lead to badly stuck burned food this is going to be typical of pretty much any multiclad all clad stainless steel cookware if you don't like this stick with hard anodized or something of the sort temperature shock honestly this should go without saying but really the last thing you want to do is go from cooking to putting this under cold water i've seen reviews from pros using this specific cookware where they have done this and the pan was fine but really you seriously run the risk of warping any cookware doing this just don't do it time for the pros stainless steel really there's not much to say here because the outer and inner surfaces are stainless steel as long as you're not abusing the pans they'll last forever there isn't a non stick surface that slowly turns turns into a reason for throwing it out heats evenly quickly the fact that these have an aluminum core sandwiched by stainless steel really helps these pans heat up quick and even i've made frittata and numerous other things and get a pretty consistent cook throughout the entire thing it would help if my stove top were more level but there's little i can do about that without replacing the entire top the whole stove is level tapered rim i've poured out sauces soups bacon grease etc it all pours out really easy and smooth i can't comment on it being drip free as i always have a paper towel or something handy to wipe the edge force of habit cooked eggs without sticking yeah i've read numerous reviews saying that eggs stick like crazy to these it's the one thing that made me wait weeks prior to even think about cooking eggs let alone over easy eggs on these i can safely say that eggs swirl around on these pans just as good as any perfectly new non stick pan granted you need to make sure you heat the pan just right and prep it i haven't tried putting eggs in with just butter yet but i would imagine it would work usually i'll put a about an th of a teaspoon of canola oil in the pre heated pan and use a paper towel to cover the surface and the sides let it sit for a few seconds then put a little butter in the bottom i have yet to have any eggs stick at all in fact i threw out my old non stick i kept around specifically for eggs cooking predictable because the pans heat evenly and they're super conductive cooking because so much more predictable and you use much less heat on my old pans i'd usually cook most things on medium high i've found medium with these has been equivalent polenta rice etc all cook really nicely because you can just set the heat to low and just let it go at first i was a bit worried about the lids not being see through as i've always had glass lids but now i've come to not care all in all every single time i cook with this cookware i always find myself saying i love these pans i have yet to have food stick to them at least to the point where it's destroying the food the only thing i haven't tried are fish and pancakes but i would imagine pancakes would stick regardless if you're having a problem with all your food sticking you're doing it wrong you're most likely over heating the pan watch some youtube vids about proper use of stainless steel cookware and you should be able to figure it out the perfect solution for our induction cook top no mess easy clean for bacon pancakes french toast great pan i made mexican rice and pan did not stick and was so easy to clean good quality great price this cookware is wonderful and a purchase i am happy to have made i have had and have used this cookware set for close to a year now and i love it it still looks brand new before this set i have always used non stick cookware so this was hard to get used to everything stuck at first and i used barkeepers friend a lot if you re only used to non stick it can be very frustrating as there is a learning curve and sometimes it takes awhile lol now i couldn t imagine going back to non stick cookware i really love cooking with this set this is the perfect size weight and design and performs well i purchased it over a year ago and it is now our favorite pan we even own some all clads i have had this multiclad cookware for years it cooks evenly and shows no sign of wear i would buy it again great cookware at a great price so far two months in absolutely in love with everything about this set they are my dream pots and pans heavy and durable as hell even cooking and by the way non stick is terrible for the environment and for you and yours and stainless steel like this great set doesn t stick if you know how to cook just sayin to the seller thanks so much product arrived on time and mint we just used this set and are positively pleased with it beautiful and cleans up nice these pots and pans are beautiful and very heavy which is exactly what i was looking for the finish is nice and smooth on each piece i cooked eggs this morning with absolutely nothing sticking to the pan and it cleaned up nicely too with just a little swish of soap and water i think the people who are having sticking issues are not greasing their pans and cooking at too hot of a temperature i used a spritz of oil spray in my pan and cooked using medium heat with perfect results thick construction means this pot is heavy and even heating it's a good size if you want it to be your only one i own other multiclad products and i use this smaller pan the most it heats up very quickly and cooks well my only con no matter how low i put the heat on food tends to stick to the bottom sometimes these are beautiful and beautifully made pans they distribute the heat evenly and i like the fact they will work with induction stoves as well they also feel heavy well balanced and have nice handles great pan even cooking easy clean up solid pots and pans with very good weights the handles stay cool but the lids get hot when they are on the pot be careful and use oven mitts to lift the lids or you might burn yourself also they discolor the first time you use them i haven't tried yet but apparently they are easy to clean as long as you are careful and take good care of them this is a great set i haven't used these yet but i am so excited to they are beautiful and i love the feel of them will update at a later time excited to cook with these i would buy this again i received this and i like it lot this is the first set i owned i really like this stainless set excellent buy no one could touch this deal it was a pleasure doing business with you a nice heavy pan for even heat distribution it's my go to pan bought this set for my wife for christmas they replaced a set she has had since college they are very substantial heat evenly and are beautiful she is very happy with them the only thing she didn't like was that the lid handles get very hot her old set had plastic handles that stayed cool just a matter of remembering to grab a pot holder to remove the lid the pots polish up very nice with bar keeper's friend which effortlessly removes any discoloration that some reviewers have complained about we use microfiber dishtowels to dry them and give them a final buffing it is also important to use wooden utensils because they will scratch due to the great heat distribution it has never been necessary to use anything higher than medium high heat after one year of use they still look and perform like new another nice feature is the pouring lip which the french version of these pots didn't have nice even spill proof pouring every time we are convinced that this will be the last pot set we will ever need and that someone else will get plenty of use out of them after we are gone stars if they had cool lid handles works much better than our previous griddle on the same stove pancakes fluffier with the same recipe worth the extra money so far love the way the handles are vertical and not horizontal allows it to fit better on our burners this is a beautiful pan still shiny after first use and stove top gravy cleaned really easily and is really sturdy my former roasting pan had floppy handles so i m loving the ease of getting pan in and out of oven with the upright handles i have the a set of cuisinart that is not the multiclad like this and it's not even half as nice the multiclad feels heavier and it's a better shine that washes easy using some barkeepers friend it was only a few dollars more than the non clad but so much better quality great pan love it heavy duty fantastic pan with a nice fitting lid i prefer non stick pans that don't have plastic components so that i can use it on the stove top or in the oven for example i cooked pork chops on the stove top then finished baking them covered in the oven with the lid on they came out perfectly also good for frittatas i'm happy with this griddle it was hard to find one that works with an induction stove top but this is exactly what i wanted now i can make a big batch of pancakes in half the time fries bacon well too don't use it the high setting only use that for boiling water very heavy construction retains heat everything i was looking for this is my every day pot for cooking i love it easy to clean non sticking i'm thinking about buying another one a different size pot very good quality i have used this pan for two thanksgivings now and there is plenty of room for a twenty pound and up turkey super nice you don't need all clad this are quality made product extremely pleased with cuisinart on these high quality cookware love this and is comparable to the allclad version i have had these pans for a few months now and i absolutely love them just be sure not to use high heat on them they don't need it and you'll burn the food i found that out the hard way even though i read it in the manual have tested this twice so far since i got it does exactly what i want it to do roasted a pound chicken when i first got it then a ish pound turkey this week all good i didn't make gravy after roasting the chicken why must have forgotten but i did after the turkey and oh heck yes i was able to put this right across two electric stove burners and scrape those drippings up just fine the chicken looked hilariously puny in this size of a pan to be honest so did the turkey a bit but that makes me confident that i can use it for a pound behemoth next thanksgiving if i want other relevant thoughts i watched very carefully for the pitting issues some reviewers mentioned nothing so far i haven't used anything acidic in it just in case but i will at some point and adjust this review if needed there were of course fork marks from where i made gravy but that happens to my mixing bowls too and has never escalated into an issue again if it does i'll update the rack doesn't quite look feel as high quality as the pan but so far has worked just fine either the rack or the pan itself is warped gotta be the rack or if not it's only a slight flaw and has yet to cause any issues it wobbles within the pan annoying and the reason this review is stars instead of but hasn't caused any half cooked poultry to fling itself across my kitchen so no worries yes it's dishwasher safe i was worried about that ran it through on the top shelf because that's where it fit best used the pots and pans setting with my usual detergent tab and it came out fine no clue yet how that will work out in the long term over years or decades but so far so good the rack went on the bottom shelf and came out spotless which was nice part of why i got rid of my old pan rack combo was because i was still scrubbing turkey schmutz out of that thing a week after thanksgiving last year if you're used to smaller or lower quality pans know that this is much heavier and that it may take a few uses to get accustomed to the size and angle of the handles you'll probably be fine i have moderate arthritis in my hands and was still able to move it easily but take the weight into consideration for the first few uses that being said the handles are very useful makes it easy to get a firm secure grip i have no idea why at the time i'm posting this the amazon price is showing up at i paid something a month or so ago at the price i paid this is a good investment in functionality and size any higher and i'd be a little dubious but your mileage may vary i'm coming from a lower middle class perspective here if spending on a roasting pan is normal for you go for it you're unlikely to find it for much less than i paid but if you do jump on it good pan worth getting i've had this set and a few other pieces for months use it every day and am very pleased i'm somewhat baffled by reviews that complain about sticking a few points to keep in mind these pans heat quickly and with less heat than cheaper pans a setting of of on my large burners will cause canola and olive oil to smoke i now treat as high heat works fine for searing meats follow the instructions heat the pan then add oil when the oil has heated up add the food level your stove so oil will sit evenly in the pan when the pans have cooled touchable i put in hot water with a squirt of dishwashing soap and let it sit for a few minutes then clean with the hard side of a no scratch sponge if anything is left a bit of bar keeper's friend cuts right through it in seconds and polishes the surface nicely it's so easy i never put them in the dishwasher i have had some minor warping with the skillet and qt saute pan neither of which are included in this set they still seem to cook well no issue with the pots or smaller pans i'm buying my son a multi clad unlimited saute pan to test whether the ply construction stainless interior aluminum exterior has the same minor warping issue or not these are the bomb of course the bar was pretty low we had reverveware that had to be years old so these are great look great feel solid and maybe a little on the heavy side learning how to cook with them now price wise for the value i was very pleased even bought silicone utensils to try and keep them looking great this cookware is durable and solid it cooks well and cleans off easy as well i prefer the steel lids versus glass steel lids can be placed in over for reheating or after searing foods i recommend good price heavy duty should last forever really enjoy using these multiclad pans very easy to maintain overheating will destroy any pan the inside can be cleaned with just the rough side of a kitchen sponge bar keepers friend as needed but the really heavy discoloration on the outside of the pans can be removed safely with easy off i think all the brands that sell multiclad use the same material shop price my wife was really happy with this gift very high quality this set of pans has been fantastic i really like how heavy each piece is even the little pot is surprisingly heavy these get hot fast and maintain heat well i used to have problems boiling water on my gas range but no longer the heating is pretty even and i feel like the quality of my cooking has improved having the no drip rims is a huge plus no sticking issues with proper use but i do use my seasoned carbon steel for eggs functionality aside these look great as well good love my pan not lightweight made of durable mid weight stainless steel and stay cool handle glass top perfect and a great price excellent this is the second set pans which we purchased and both have been great they work wonderfully with induction stoves we had to leave the first set with our rental home that had an induction stove this was a replacement pan for the exact same older cuisinart pan the only problem i have is the handles are thinner cheaper and i burned my finger on it the older pan had thicker handles not cool when you pay top dollar for something and they have made it cheaper nothing but the best big and heavy and cooks with percect heat distribution remember keep the flame low to medium never use on a high setting exactly what i needed and it works perfectly with my cuisinart pots arrived sooner than expected nice small sauce pan great pots and pans excellent thank you so e fine cuisinart quality we love this big pan this is truly an all around great skillet that is not non stick so i can heat the skillet empty then add food it is heavy but the helper remains cool so it is easier to lift washes beautifully will get a whole set in the future unlike some of the reviews i find that this pot works well and doesn't deform however it would still be wise to read the suggestions provided in the product box do not use high heat and definitely don't let the pot dry out while on the stove this will discolor the bottom with multiclads you don't need to blast the fire all the way up i just use medium heat max and it still heats up fast this pot is dishwasher safe but hand washing is still preferred to avoid damaging the surface over time overall i like this product i use it to make ramen boil water make small batches of stock etc it is well balanced and won't tip over to the side like some cheap pots tend to do the handle is solid and doesn't wobble the lid handle can get a bit hot so i just use a kitchen towel to lift it up the handle is big enough anyway that having a glove on or a towel shouldn't be an issue i like the product so much that i just leave it on the stove top along with my cast iron skillet the pot has earned its permanent place as a daily workhorse the price also isn't bad definitely worth the purchase i have had this and i am still happy with it it still looks news so it cleans up well i feel it also heats evenly very glad i finally splurged and bought a quality set of pots and pans i have a flat electric stovetop and the lower quality pots i had just took ages to heat up boiling water for pasta was such a chore this set clearly has vastly superior thermal conductivity and heats up approximately a billion times more quickly potentially slightly exaggerated but probably not much everything is also nice shiny stainless steel looks and feels really high quality the one unfortunate thing i have noticed is that the lids do get pretty warm i definitely need to use an oven mitt to hold the lids if they've been on warm pots or pans for too long i don't mind it since they do look really nice and i always have an oven mitt in reach anyways but worth noting if that's a huge deal for you beautiful roasting pan haven't used it yet but hope to for the holidays purchased it because i found many good reviews on different sites for this pan i have been loving these pan there is a learning curve when switching to stainless but it's not that bad and i feel better knowing i am not cooking with chemicals i did order from another retailer because i am scared of fakes after reading reviews about the pan warping and someone thinking it could be fake i got nervous other companies prices are lower or comparable anyways and after receiving them i don't see how a pan this thick could warp i mean it is really heavy i love them my wife and i love these we started out with the non stick pans that it seems like every couple starts out with and finally decided to upgrade to a nicer set of stainless steel pans after almost months of use we've really enjoyed these pans they are heavier and nicer than we expected and heat evenly comes with the right amount of pans and pots for all of your normal every day needs you do have to get used to cooking with these after using non stick pans but the learning curve is quick additionally it really helps if you soak the pots pans immediately after cooking to help remove the food when you get to cleaning them we've had these for a few months and i love them i use these for everything but eggs because that can be a pain to clean off otherwise cooking on these is great and they clean easily they heat up pretty fast on our gas stove definitely buy some stainless cleaner if you buy these perfect size cooks evenly and beautifully a this is a great pan however it does get dirty really fast there are some stains that just don't seem to come off with a regular soap and sponge treatment this really doesn't bother me too much but it's not ideal i would recommend this product because i think it is a good value pan but keep in mind that it is not the top of the line it is not indestructible so you shouldn't use it on really high heat and you should stick to wooden and plastic utensils so as not to damage the surface using it since a couple months now and i have to say this is my best pan to date no trouble cleaning and cooking is so quick i went to bb and b to compare the all clad triple ply with this set bb and b had other sets from cuisnart but not the multiclad pro now i see why the cuisinart multiclad pro is better and a side by side comparison would leave all clad in the dust the handles on the cuisinart are much more comfortable and the thickness of the metal is the same as the all clad the cuisinart multiclad pro is better ray i bought this after my wife complained constantly for two weeks about how much she hated our new le creuset pan because it stained so bad we've owned cheap stainless pans that never stained we bought a very expensive set of le creuset and it stains bad enough where you can't get it out by scrubbing with a plastic scouring pad i called le creuset and they recommended bar keepers friend funny how this pan doesn't need that to stay clean and the quality of the cuisinart is just as good if not better the handle on the le creuset is better but that's about it given the choice after owning both is that the cuisinart is better to cook with and therefore the better choice i'd like to mention that the le creuset enamaled cast iron dutch ovens are amazing just because i think their stainless stuff is the pits and cuisinart blows it away i recognize some of their offerings are top notch great as all of their pots have been using this for several months nonstick holding up very well no issues these pots and pans are great they heat up relatively quick and evenly and are very easy to clean after a quick soak best part is they don't leave any 'teflon' or 'non stick' material on my food and they look great to boot actually all the compliments i receive from people are on how nice they look larger than expected but great quality my husband surprised me with these to replace our year old set of nonstick pots pans was a little intimidated at first but quickly got the hang of how much heat they needed easy to clean cook perfect every time quicker too for those with an at instant pot the large lid fits perfectly love it excellent quality and value as is all of the multiclad pieces this is a nice set very well made and heavyweight nice quality top edges are a bit sharp researched the web and this set was often rate best value great to be able to purchase it at an amazing price on amazon quality pots and pans for price these are the best pans ever made i have a couple of all clad narrow handles that don t compare to these the handles are wide enough so you can get a good grip on them they clean easily and stay shinny don t use metal utensils in these pans scratches cause food to stick you won t be disappointed great set before purchasing this set i had been using allclad tri ply stainless then allclad copper core cookware for several years this set cooks every bit as well as those did despite the fact that this set costs less than some of the individual knives i keep in the kitchen i wouldn t trade them for much of anything that said here are my only critical comments the omelet pan is nearly useless it s really only well suited to a fried egg or two and for that non stick or cast iron is a more suitable material i replaced this with a non stick for these tasks the handles on the qt stock pot are a little thinner and less comfortable to hold when the pot is full than the ac version which is more rounded beveled the metal lids are compact durable and light but glass lids would be helpful at times there are replacements that will fit of course and i will be using them for a few of the pieces the qt pot is too small to prepare many sides for even just two people in for example if making mashed potatoes and steaming broccoli you d have to use the qt and the qt stock pot which is overkill for the task as the qt couldn t handle either at first i thought the steamer basket was silly since i had one already and didn t feel the need for another that said i find myself using the one included in the set and am very pleased with it all in all i think with a few specific additions a non stick fry pan a glass lid or two and some supplemental pieces to fit your family size and cooking needs this is unquestionably the most sensible cookware set available at the time that we purchased these a kitchen store nearby was liquidating stock some ac pieces were on sale for off this was still a smarter buy and i m glad we got these instead other than the handles on the qt pot feeling thinner there isn t a single thing that separates these from ac in the hand or on the burner love it works great freakin love this product line as good as my all clad you can hammer in nails fight off an intruder use it to deflect grenade shrapnel and then cook eggs on it bought on a hunch and totally happy so happy i've basically replaced all my kitchenware to cuisinart pots pans all clad can keep their over priced elitist crap i've got cuisinart couldn't ask for a better skillet beautiful and highly functional cookware i updated from caphelon and am much happier with this set heats evenly and cleans up easily with a little bartender's friend love it this is an excellent pan i use for caramel and couldn't be happier with performance we love this pan this is our second identical one our other one we had for years but it does eventually get scratched up it's a nice large size and i chose this style because of the second handle that's a must when lifting and pouring and helpful when washing super good quality cookware set recommended i am now hooked on stainless cuisinart is always reliable quality and a value price point the pots and pans heat evenly and if you follow the instructions of cooking with stainless never cook on high heat pan before adding oil let oil heat a little before adding food and cooking at medium heat is usually just fine they really do a great job and clean up easy i've used this pan for month now and it is a good heavy skillet i really like the glass lid some stuff sticks and i've had to use 'barkeeps friend' multiple times to get various stuff off but otherwise its a good cooking tool excellent excellent product love this cookware i adore cooking in these pans they clean up beautifully i did season them all and they work like nonstick pans but the flavor in the food is so much better used for marinated meats tofu stir fry vegetables and mostly eggs easy clean up with no discoloration after months it seems to cook the food evenly i haven't noticed any hot spots the handle remains very cool at high temperatures which was a bonus i wasn't expecting overall it's a great pan and i don't know what else you would want from this size or material great pot would buy another but i don't think i'd ever need to my husband got me these pans and i love them while they are not as easy as your typical non stick stuff once you know how to care for them they are a breeze always preheat the pan but not on super high there is no need you should not ever need to go above med med hi if you need to use a higher heat like to sear a steak then use a solid cast iron pan wash your pans immediately and keep bartender's friend on hand always dry your pans with a cloth do not air dry especially if you have hard water a lot of the pictures here where people were unhappy with the pans is because they used too high heat and did not dry the pans quickly so far i have made chicken curry and swiss steak so far i love it these are some quality items they're heavy and feel solidly built waaaay cheaper than all clad which is why i settled on this brand so far i've used the steamer the large pot the small pot and the saut pan making a variety of foods like custard gravy pasta pasta sauce veggies i haven't had any problems i did quite a bit of research about stainless steel before using them though most people who write negative reviews clearly just have no idea how to cook with them and try using them like cheap nonstick pans it seems like only a minority of reviewers actually received something defective i feel like i shouldn't have to include the following information but obviously it's necessary as people aren't doing the research themselves the trick is to let the skillets or saut pan heat up completely then add butter swirl it around then add whatever you're cooking the food should not stick mine didn't if you're boiling water let the water come to a full boil before adding salt otherwise the bottom of the pan could become pitted from the salt try not to use metal utensils as these will scratch the stainless steel i use wooden and silicone utensils with mine these are dishwasher safe but if the pans are knocking around against other dishes this could also lead to scratching some discoloration can occur from food sticking and burning which again shouldn't happen if you're using the above method some can occur from chemicals in the water wherever you're living you probably can't help that one but it's still not the pan's fault some can occur on the bottom of the pan if you're using extra high heat i've never had to go above a medium medium high heat setting if plain old dish soap isn't cutting it try bar keepers friend and a heavy duty sponge like jetz scrubs both available on amazon yes people it requires some work some effort but so does good cooking it requires some time and attention and if you just want to cobble something together on the stove and walk away and leave it there these probably are not for you but if you want to take your cooking to the next level then these are worth it these feel like they'll last a long time and from other reviewers it looks like they do take care of your pots and pans and you shouldn't have a problem great great excellent quality way better for cooking veggies than a regular skillet works well but the lid and handle gets too hot heavy duty feels like it can compare with my all clad only used it once as of yet but so far i love it beautiful and high quality yes works perfectly on my kitchenaid induction range with bridge burners set to about made perfect pancakes love it it's beautiful and does exactly what it promised great buy for the money love this set functional and beautiful makes cooking a pleasure thus far the cuisinart multiclad pro stainless cookware has meet all our expectations and we are very pleased works well on the linked elements of our ge induction stove plus it has a good non stick surface not cheap but good alternative to a cast iron unit great pan great pan bought this for boiling eggs and cooking oatmeal it's the perfect size great price too for the quality i have calphalon tri ply cookwares but thought i'd give this a try because of the price didn't disappoint and in fact i am very happy about this purchase in the future if i need more tri ply cookware i will definitely search for this line from cuisinart a kitchen remodel with a new glass top electric range necessitated new cookware cuisinart is a name it trust these are awesome no stick even heat heavy and beautiful angry at myself for waiting so long to get this cooks good quickly and evenly looks sharp and contains everything you need only complaint is how hard they are to clean no matter how i spray or prep them first i didn't know what to expect when i ordered this set of pots and pans after much research they weren't the least or most expensive that said i couldn't be happier these pans are beautiful to look at and absolutely wonderful for cooking i was replacing a scratched up non stick set that i had put up with for the past few years they'd only lasted about years the last few years often peeling and unfit to use i use cooking spray on these stainless steel pans and they stick far less than my damaged teflon coated pans they heat up much faster than the pans i was used to so take care my daughter in law spent an exorbitant amount on all clad and i like this cuisinart set much better it is better looking and the handles are far more comfortable to hold i want to keep mine pretty so i keep barkeepers friends handy for cleaning stains you will love these pots and pans everything you expect and more large stable love the big handles and didn't burn the gravy on the stove top this is a well made sturdy item and works great bought this to make lasagna for a crowd i was going to buy the less expensive model than this but i'm glad i didn't this one is made of heavier steel than the other model lasagna came out great and it was easy to clean up absolutely love this pan cleans up like a dream nice even cooking great bottom clearance for roasting i cannot believe simply cannot believe how much nicer the food turns out and how much easier the clean up is then with my cheaper roasting pans so far i've used it to make deep dish lasagna i also boiled the noodles in it so they would not get crumpled roast two chickens at a time a turkey to clean it do as instructed fill with water put in dish soap i use dawn and let soak with the rack resting inside it literally just wipes out i wish i had purchased this years earlier comparable to all clad and it's one third the price best roasting pan i ever bought cooks great cleans so easily great quality and appearance i did a lot of research before purchasing this for my mom she loves it and is way cheaper than buying an allclad in my opinion allclads are not worth the money especially when you can get just as good of quality pots from other brands note the patent for allclads technology has ran out so you can get similar types e g via cuisinart i guess the only reason you would purchase something like an allclad is if you're vain and want to have certain brands just to show off that's my opinion i haven't cooked with these yet but am sure they'll be great nice weight good reviews well package and i like the lifetime guarantee i had been eyeing them for a long time and am happy i ordered love it vg vg vg love this stainless pan high quality heavy great value after using these for approximately months these pans have held up wonderfully they do not take long to heat up are durable and have solid lids cleaning them can be a bit of a pain if you're a perfectionist but if that's not the case then these are for you i buy products that seem like they will last for years and these seem to meet that criteria a great solid pan has weight to it but not to heavy cleans up like new good size for many uses i am enjoying my new ss pan it heats evenly it cleans very easily awesome well made glad it has rounded bottom as a double boiler should helps when wisking excellent product comparable to alclad without the price this is a great non stick pan for cooking i like that it can go in the dishwasher though sometimes i hand wash it anyway if any food residue sticks i either deglaze the pan while cooking always adds extra awesome flavor to your meal or let it soak overnight we use this pan several times a week and i love it this is a great non stick pan for cooking i like that it can go in the dishwasher though sometimes i hand wash it anyway if any food residue sticks i either deglaze the pan while cooking always adds extra awesome flavor to your meal or let it soak overnight we use this pan several times a week and i love it you want to do the whole package of hash browns potato paddies giant pancakes or lots of french toast bacon this is your pan big family holidays guests over you'll love the extra room used this times now and zero torsion hand washes effortlessly and the coatings are excellent my ge burner cook top came with a drop in super heavy cast iron griddle insert where you remove that left side grate and insert the fitted custom cast iron one cast iron is such a pita that i prefer this griddle plus the custom cast iron insert doesn't have much runoff catch ability and a pound of melted bacon grease would be running all over the top of your cooktop this griddle catches it all easily the heat distribution between burners inches apart was not perfect but is so close that the point is moot anyone complaining about the minor deviation from perfect heat distribution would waste their money on any item of this kind physics just doesn't permit it if concerned just flip the food item to the warmer area when flipping time comes i had hash browns spread out evenly and used ounces entire package deep fit fine again not to be redundant but the center of the pan cooked those hash browns just fine albeit at just a few degrees less pre heat it good as the directions state and my ge profile needed even a little more time to pre heat but there is a wider distance between the burner and the top of the cooking grate than my fisher paykel which was closer holds the whole pound of thick bacon nicely and a wee bit crowded with the entire pound of thinner bacon but was fine excellent value excellent value i love them very much i like the heaviness of them and they cook evenly omg these are so nice just the right set of items for a person who daily cooks meals read many reviews on stainless steel cookware before i settled on this one a great choice fantastic quality seems professional wow simply awesome i do feel the need to mention that although i am an ahem 'older' woman this is my very first set of high quality stainless steel cookware this set was recommended to me by the chef of a cooking class i'm taking and holy cow what a difference a good quality set of cookware can make to your food i have never cooked with cookware that wasn't coated and non stick but now that i know what i'm doing thanks to the cooking class my dishes are turning out great and my food doesn't stick to the pans like i thought it would it's a wonderful beautiful thing this set is a terrific value and and i'm definitely sold on this pro set of stainless steel cookware i love the pan the outside of the pan went from shiny to dull after i used it quality stuff been cooking on these for a few weeks burnt stuff first couple of try's then did the butter trick working a lot better keep forgetting to put a little oil in pan after it comes up to temp but slow learner but love these pans brown nice and don't need much heat see why tv cooks use it if you want cookware to last a life time buy this set thick bottom stainless steel doesn't burn can be cleaned well in dishwasher no stains until now worked with inductive stovetop as expected would have been nice to have a gas release hole in the cover but not a big deal awesome i replaced my heavy non dishwasher safe calphalon set with this cuisinart stainless steel it's great to cook in i have an electric stovetop so it's tricky to get it right i put everything in the dishwasher with no pre soaking or scrubbing and it comes out looking great this could almost make we want to cook more than twice a month well not quite any cook who knows would love this pan best cookware ever i bought this to replace a hard anondized set that was scratched and peeling i was worried about buying stainless because of food sticking i have made eggs french toast etc and nothing has stuck i let the skillet heat until drops of water sizzled and then fried my eggs this cookware cleans up wonderfully if you do get stains the bar keep does remove them love love love this cookware i do have to admit i have not put it in the dishwasher even though it says it is safe perfect there is a marketing strategy where companies group lesser popular items together to bring up the number of pieces in a set this is especially popular with cookware and knives so there are items in this set that i hardly ever use however i love the items that i do use on a regular basis i highly recommend this set if you can snag it when the price is good this would be a star review if i used all of the items on a regular basis but i just don't have a call for the two smallest pans on even an occasional basis great pans just what i was hoping for should have picked these up a long time ago high quality cooks even high quality cooks even so far so good my only disappointment was in the frying pots i was sure they would be larger but they are definitely too small for my huge family still the set is heavy and sturdy and cooks very well exactly the same as my super expensive all clad these pans are wonderful i love the stainless steel excellent roasting pan my favorite pan love the short handles big only problem is the bottom is not flat it rocks and spins on my flat surface stove hoping vendor will make good i have several pieces of high end cookware with stainless steel interiors they are fantastic to cook with but there are a few items like eggs that are far easier to cook in a non stick pan so i keep a single pan around just for that non stick pans won't last even if you are careful to use silicone tools in them hand wash them and most importantly never overheat them if you do all of these things they will last about a year then start sticking a little a first then more as time goes on i push mine to two years then replace it with a new one same size and model i chose this one because it is multi layer it has stainless on the outside with enough carbon in it to work with an induction stovetop induction stoves use a strong magnetic field to heat up the pan itself rather than the burner underneath it they are still relatively rare and expensive but they work very well and are gaining in popularity they also require a magnetic pan to work so this one fits the bill it will also work very well on all other stove types of course the inside layer is thicker and aluminum which conducts heat much better and more evenly than steel this makes the pan respond quickly to the burner temperature and helps eliminate hot spots finally the inside layer is layer of non magnetic stainless coated with a very good quality nonstick teflon coating the non stick coating isn't great for searing and you won't get any fond with this but it makes a very forgiving surface for an omelet or thin crepe it is a great pan and i've decided it is worth it to me to pay the price for it even though i know it won't last i like that it responds and is constructed similarly to my other pans so it isn't much of an adjustment when i use it it is definitely on the high end of how much you should pay for a non stick pan if you want a better value and do not have an induction stove i highly recommend this one farberware restaurant pro aluminum nonstick inch skillet silver it is half the price and still excellent the farberware will not work on an induction stove isn't as heavy and does not have the stainless layer on the bottom however it is a great buy for the money and makes more sense financially given the disposable nature of non stick pans if the price of the cuisinart continues to rise my next replacement will be the farberware recommended even though it is on the pricey side sean logue this is just about perfect for my needs one minor quibble pouring stuff out works best if the handle is slowly rotated to a vertical position keeping it horizontal requires quite a bit of strength to turn the pot oh well i can make that adjustment excellent the newlyweds that i bought the pots for love them and can't wait to use them can be used on an induction cooktop got this on prime day to replace my year old calphalon hard anaodized set we received as a wedding gift i figured i would order this decide which one i liked more and give one to my sone who is moving out for the first time the calphalon was hard used nad coupld have been taken care of better but teaching three kids and my wife to cook put it to it's test so was showing it's age and i was looking for something 'prettier' for when we had people over out of the box everythign was packaged well both original packaging and the amazon packaging the individual pieces were heavy which i was worried they would seem flimsy totally not the case welds are sturdy for handles and finish was perfect ever single piece seemed to be one size smaller that what i had with my old set the sizes should be fine for an average family but if you often cook for or more plan on ordering some of the larger pieces the stickers on the lids were annoying to remove but not a big deal cooking eveything works great with my ceramic cookrange heating is even it does seem to retain heat better than my old set and if you're going to turn it down right before something boils over you're going to be a few minutes too late i do use my cast iron for searing meat and cooking eggs so i can't comment on how it browns meat i have not gone from range to oven with these yet but don't see it being an issue handles remain cool which is great cleaning no issues so far with cleaning them and them looking like new i am on a well with a lot of minerals so water spots keep me busy i have not run them through the dishwasher and probably never will overall my son is enjoying the old calphalon set in his apartment i think my wife really likes these too but just wont admit it you may need to buy a few larger pieces depending on your cooking style qt stockpot was a must have it's wider and taller than the qt that comes with this set i have a few other pieces on my wish list that i'll be ordering over the next couple of months but i must admit i'm surprised that a set that cost half as much as the calphalon set performs as well as this does stainless is a change but it hasn't been a bad one for me this is a great set and i'm glad i gave it a shot i use it on my induction cooktop quality cooking gear this set has worked out really well for me i only wish they could stack better since my kitchen is small and limited on space i got these for my dad and they work very well not only are these pots and pans beautifully designed they perform to perfection very even heat distribution is what any serious cook desires and these deliver on every expectation highly recommended i love this pan set little but if sticking but only if i forget or don't put enough oil or spray before cooking they cook better than my old pans spreads heat evenly they're heavy though i love them on my new radiant glass top range perfect size for our induction range to fit over burners nice pan instructions say not to clean with anything abrasive which is bs you can't remove certain stuck on stuff without something abrasive i love these pans i use them every day the steamer is a plus bonus my broccoli comes out tasting wonderful pots clean up so easy one of the best investments i have made we use it on our conduction burners for frying bacon works perfectly beautiful large pan great for baking several chicken pieces or large piece of meat wish it had a flat rack to lift small pieces like chicken wings but overall i've really enjoyed it cleans up beautifully too i absolutely love love love the quality of these pans i used to cook professionally and have not had really nice cookware since growing up and getting my own place this is the first time i have purchased my own pots and pans rather than accepting hand me downs it is one of the best purchases i've ever made in my lifetime and i'm old so that's saying something they're beautiful they're heavy the heat well they're easy to keep clean and they're pretty stick resistant i really really love them great pan handle had chip in hanger hole not a big deal but not the most happy thing overall worth it i love how the set looks and it feels extremely sturdy i can't wait to actually try them out if i remember too i'll update my review once i've tested them this is a superior pan large enough for a turkey and used it yesterday for racks of ribs fits racks end to end and held racks of country style ribs sturdy handles make trip to grill to finish easier cleaned up with no issue great investment i can't believe i am so excited over this roasting pan cuisinart is the best value out there for the price excellent on induction burner as well as conventional electric burner cleans up beautifully in the dishwasher if you hate washing frying pans get this i would definitely buy another one in a larger size this sturdy griddle works great on my new cooktop induction range i have a bridge and it heats evenly i have cooked average sized pancakes on this griddle i was surprised that after the first washing there were scratches on the non stick surface even though i used a sponge to wash it great good quality and very easy to clean but it is leaving marks on my kitchen aid glass cook top constantly having to wax it to keep it clean great pans very sturdy and also attractive but they are stainless steel and you must make sure you follow the manufacturers directions to ensure easy cleanup they look great in my cabin hanging from a rack i'm not sure stainless is for me but they sure look nice the weirdest things stick to stainless for example bacon sticks really bad good way to ruin the pan i'm a first time stainless steel pan user so take it with a grain of salt i noticed if i soak the pan right after using it they seem to clean up much easier i can't exactly hang tfal pans from my pan rack so i'm going to ride it out and try to learn how to use these pans no quality issues but i'm not expecting stainless steel pans to stay in perfect condition either very nice set overall pleased with this purchase four stars because the pan arrived with a black substance in a few places on the inside that won't come off with washing the rest of the set arrived in perfect condition like everything about it they are a great buy handles aren't too thick or too thin takes a little effort to clean but sparkle when done good all around sauce pan easy to clean i bought this set in and still love using it i cook everything from scratch and these pans have been well used but still look like new i wash them by hand soon after cooking and use bar keepers friend when needed we now have a winter home in the south and i purchased another set last week for this home i expect both sets of pans will outlast me great set cooking without the non stick coating takes some getting used to but you can do it nice heavy ss set be careful not to scratch with metal utensils though it can cause your food to stick love this griddle works perfectly on my ceramic stove with the pan's perfectly flat bottom great okay to be honest it took me a bit and a few google searches to learn how to cook on this but not i love it use it daily i love this roaster it's the first good one i've ever had the metal is thick and strong easy to clean and cooks perfectly chickens turkeys rib roasts pork it's big enough for almost anything you might want to roast i've had had several roasting pans i hat the non stick ones as any roasting rack will scratch the finish somehow even without scratches they are never really non stick either this one like other cuisinart pans i own seems built to last forever they cook great but trying to figure out how to clean them and keep things from sticking very difficult to get the grease off the sides but as far as cooking very even heat food seems to cook better we're just learning how to use them hoping to find a solution they are staining up a bit already tho i scrub i purchased a quart to be used as a sauce pan however i've used it for much more than sauces this is an excellent pot that heats up quickly and is well sized for making dinners for people it remains one of the most used pieces in my kitchen and looks as good as the day that i bought it get your baking soda and hydrogen peroxide ready to help shine these cooking legends up because you will find every single reason you can to cook beautiful and even cooking looking forward to thanksgiving the measurements by the manufacturer are misleading typical they are not including lid inside below the rim and tall measured on the exterior it holds exactly quarts to the start of the rolled rim i purchased this to replace a cheap anodized aluminum pan with a peeling non stick coating i have a bunch of all clad d which i adore and this seems to be as thick i'm not doing temperamental cooking with this size saucepan so i expect it should be just fine it has a nice weight and seems well balanced great quality product you would expect from all things cuisinart we love cuisinart in our household we wanted something that would work well with making pancakes and bacon in the morning and this fit the bill perfectly it sits on top of our two burners on our electric glass stove top and works great evenly cooks food and no sticking great pan replacement for same pan from set bought yrs ago great stuff bought the full set a few years ago and still adding more pieces as needed love love love amazing set of pots pans easy to clean cook foods evenly i will never go back to teflon i was leary of purchasing stainless steel pans because past experience has been they can be difficult to clean these are not if you follow the directions and preheat the pans before adding oil butter and immediately put the pots in hot soapy water when you are finished cooking you will find that they clean up nicely i also like to use a very small amount barkeeper's helper for those really tough stains and each time the pot comes out shiny and clean i'm really happy with the purchase of these pots and pans you have to cook on a low temperature setting as they conduct heat very well my wife said she wasn't going to use them because they were not non stick but now she uses them all the time and loves them be sure and read every word of the instructions on how to use them and how to care for them fantastic professional heavy duty cookware cooks evenly and no fuss cleaning just soak a few minutes after use and food releases with ease heavy duty but not heavy cleans easily i ordered this because my cast iron griddle was a bear to clean after use this griddle is manageable and cooks pancakes very well i am a little worried it will warp which would reduce its efficiency on my induction cooktop but so far so good love it this supplement seems to work as promised however i question how old it is the expiration date on the package is one year from now however the coupons that were inside were long overdue since using this supplement my hair is super shiny with lots of new growth great for those going ultra blonde while maintaining healthy hair love these vitamins they were my last hope and i started using them back in january i ordered the days supply to try them out after a lady from the church told me about them when i ask for prayer because my hair was shedding so much and at the rate it was going i would have no hair within days i quickly took the information and ordered them after about days of trying the products it worked i purchased the shampoo and condidtioner it is amazing and worth it no breakage the scalp is healthy and still working this is my rd box we all know a womens hair is her glory and i dont like to wear wigs with this products i dont have to and my

as it had since the last time i saw her weeks prior i'm very happy with the results and continuing using it no side effects my hair falls out less and seems a whole lot healthier used this for two years wonderful difference in hair absolutely recommend this product ok i held off writing this review until i could say that i have been using this product for a while so i have been using this product since march that would be just about years i have a thyroid condition which i think is somewhat responsible for my hair thinning i'm so i'm also expecting to get some thinning just due to age but i had started to see more hair loss that i liked my thick ponytails were getting quite thin i did some research and found this product i have been taking it faithfully twice per day for the past two years it took some time for me to see a difference but now i can honestly say that my hair feels much thicker than it has in years its still not quite as thick as when i was years old but there is absolutely no sign of thinning spots and it looks and feels very full when i touch it i'm also noticing a lot of new hair growth many little hairs growing all over my head i noticed this more because almost at the same time i started taking this product i decided to grow out my bangs now that they are all gone i am noticing how many little hairs are wanting to replace my bags its actually very exciting to see all this growth if you want immediate results then maybe this is not the product for you but if you have a little time then go ahead and try it i am happy that i did and i will continue to use it well this product seems to be working with my hair texture and growth you need to try it at least months to see any results absolutely love my hair is so much healthier new growth my hairdresser noticed the difference my hair is growing back thanks to this vitamin viviscal works i recommend it all the time i didn t really see results until months but it did help with hair growth works best product ever i noticed the difference within a week not associated with this company to start off someone at work and i were talking and she recommended me to try this since my hair was disappear in and what was left was thinning ok so i tried it and after about days actually noticed my hair thickening have been using it now for a year and still see the results i also noticed that when i get a haircut the scissors sound like they are chopping hair and that seems like another sign love it i started using this because my hair started thinning in the back it seems to really be helping even my eyelashes are getting longer my husband noticed and now he's starting to use it amazing product it really works however only for length no good results on roots my hair has grown i use it once a day my wife is seeing a difference in her hair after less than months of use these were almost half the price of walgreens the directions say to take two a day i only take a day when i take my other morning vitamins i feel like i'm still getting some of the benefits though and i'm really loving this stuff not sure if it's just a placebo effect but i feel like my hair is growing faster i also feel like i'm losing less hair when brushing or showering i'm not sure if this is a result of the product but my nails are actually growing long and strong for the first time in my life easy to use no side effects both hair and nails feel better i have been using this product for several years and have noticeable results i can tell such a difference in my hair fullness i was losing my hair for unknown reasons but a friend told me to try viviscal because it was working for her what a big change i couldn t live without these i have a lot of hair fall out form hormone issues and medications and this helps a lot if you're experiencing hair loss for no apparent reason take this works wonders i bought this as a shot in the dark to try anything and i only took the morning dose i was going through a very stressful time i just had a baby and my mom got sick so my hair was falling out from all the stress but i m so excited how well it s been working this isn t a review but a desperate plea please tell me how long you used the product and if it really worked i m so tired of trying things that don t work and wasting time and money thanks promptly received product and it works great my girlfriend uses this very happy these have worked for me and in a short period of time highly recommend it started to grow my hair but it has been a slow slow grow i have been using this for months and i'm starting to notice a difference in the strength and thickness of my hair i have not had any side effects and would recommend this product i had to keep my hair tied back really tightly for a job so i had a ton of breakage at my temples then i was also super stressed at the time so i just had straight up hair loss this was not okay i decided to try it based on before after photos on amazon even though viviscal seemed like a fish oil salesman product when i bought it it worked within a year my hair has never been better despite my not great roots right now posting day and a year later today on march i ordered buy again which i had ordered on april i did not receive maximum i received extra strength which is my fair to me i should have gotten the product i was used to but by all means i do se results with the product i should have gotten what i had y k seems to help very happy with my purchase half the price as in dermo office this is a good product for thinning hair it was delivered on time but the box was destroyed my hair was falling out was getting so scared paranoid and insecure started using these hair stopped falling out in gobs in the shower and hair brush after a couple weeks so i m a believer continued to use but have since added other supplements to my regime also like powdered collegan i m now on month of use i will not stop using this product i am so happy to have almost no hair left on my brush when i comb it it s hard to see if my hair is filling in but it must be if it s not falling out anymore i m sure it takes months year to notice more thickness fullness since hair doesn t grow over night but i m excited at the thought of having all my hair back hello out there i am going to settle something for a lot of people especially the ones who wrote about the product being fake it s not fake it s quite real because i have used it for or years i ve been a licensed cosmetologist for many years and still practicing in wash dc here is what i can tell you from experience i found the directions not to be quite as straight forward as they should be you have to follow the directions as stated from the beginning then decrease to one a day and then continue forever i have introduced it to a good number of clients there are is hasn t worked for one client was determined and all of a sudden after years a significant amount of hair popped out around the hairline so it works you have to decide how much time your willing to invest from what i ve seen give it at least a year i myself stopped after some months and then realized it was working and went back on it my clients have done the same and it continues to work as long as you take it i actually just use it a couple days per week now and won t stop even my co workers see the difference in my hair and refer their clients to it you could spend your money on worse things bedsides getting better hair give it a try i have hypothyroidism and my hair was thinning and falling out started using this x a day for the past year took about months but my hair is healthy thicker and no longer falling out will continue to use it's really helped with my thinning hair i noticed it as well as some co workers love it product works as decribed will be buying more wife swears by this stuff great item as described excellent supplement for your hair if you take it as suggested two tabs day stabilizing hair loss i went off these vitamins for a while and noticed my skin and hair weren t as healthy i highly recommend them you will see a difference and that s why i got them again i like the product because i have thining hair and i used it before and it is helping my hair to grow have health hair and it is not falling out i guess it all depends on the person because two of my friends told me to purchase these vitamins because they were born with thin hair and they are now getting fuller hair from the bottom towards the top my one friend usually puts her hair in a little bun and now it looks like a bigger bun because it's growing so i'm taking a chance to buy them maybe they'll work for me very effective on improving hair seems to work seems to make my hair grow faster makes my hair appear thicker it took about weeks to see the difference it really makes my hair thicker great quality arrived super fast i love this product because it works fast my hair is fuller and healthier really works she love's this and states its helping so much so i reordered thx i just hope it is working this stuff really works i noticed lots of new hair growth within a few months and have continued to use this for two years now i have recommended it to several friends i can see a change in my hair getting thicker great product it was very nice thank you it s working these are the best hair supplements on the market period it takes months to notice results so be patient this is my second order thought i would give it some time before reviewing and yes this product does work but i am also taking andrew lessman s hair skin and nails i think the two together is the perfect formula i take one of the viviscal and two of the lessman s hair skin nails together daily hair is of much higher quality also also my nails are growing strong just wanted to share my experience too early now to tell it really really makes our hair grow long wirks great trying it out and it seems to work i can really see and feel a difference in my hair but it hasn t been the full months yet so i will reserve my final opinion until then now that it's past the month time frame i am disappointed to say that the product doesn't live up to its claim save your money its wasted on this product really works no side effects i don't see any major results yet but will continue as it has only been about six weeks i love viviscal my hair hasn t grown this long since i was a kid seriously it s better than biotin don t get me wrong biotin is awesome but this is a step up this is a great product the only thing is you must use it longer than they say to notice the difference been using this product for about months and my hair is growing with less hair falling out it has been days and i sear my hair is getting thicker my wife even noticed it it makes it hard when you see it every day but i sear it is working i have very baby fine hair and the hair line was receding quickly but this seems to be making it thicker no other products are being used now so it is all viviscal periodically my hair begins shedding like crazy i start taking viviscal and it slows considerably it takes at least a month to work so be patient makes hair look healthier and grows much faster will be ordering more great stuff continues to work i have alopecia this medication helped just be careful because it will make your body hair grow i started to grow peach fuzz on my face my hair is really growing back in i love it supplements are hard to give ratings for they take awhile to show results and what works for one person may not work for the next having said that i've been using viviscal for over a year my hair looks great nice shine and really full i'm in my mid 's you notice when your hair looks youthful and mine does i credit viviscal to part of that success it works and it you can notice the difference within weeks helpful and effective have been using for six months and have observed improvement in the quality of my hair but was hoping for more growth got it in time works perfect works well great stuff keeps my hair growing and seems to be healthier my hair is definitely thicker when using this product my hair is growing really fast even in bold spots and i have less hair falling out i take this product once a day with biosil hair skin nail natural nurishment and i also add another pill of biotin i see great result in weeks so im going to keep usting it i will update at the end of finish product and my next reordering of it good this stuff really works but it aggravates my cystic acne pro it works for alopecia areata i had alopecia on over of my scalp eyebrows and eyelashes i've been through it all steroid injections creams acupuncture etc nothing really worked for me my acupuncturist suggested taking viviscal in conjunction with treatment from my dermatologist i'm doing laser treatment with an excimer machine after month i started growing some spots of hair it's been over months now and my eyebrows have grown back my eyelashes are no longer falling out and the hair on my scalp is starting to fill back in i do believe it was a combination of the laser and the viviscal the viviscal kept my hair strong and expedited the growth process while the laser targeted the antibodies from attacking the hair follicle if you're just noticing some spots i highly recommend this product con increased unwanted hair on chin and upper lip i had hair loss for about months before starting to take these lost about of my hair due to stress shock i'm along with msm vitamin tablets and evening primrose oil i take one of these viviscal tablets per day they're slim and super easy to swallow it seems to have stopped my hair loss completely and it happened within just a few weeks of taking these now hopefully i'll be able to start growing it all back i'd recommend taking these supplements along with the other two msm and evening primrose oil since this trio combo seemed to work for me i hope it works for someone else too i have tried several other hair vitamins and read a lot of reviews this is my first review on amazon i think this product is essential to hair care i have a couple vitamin deficiencies pcos and a stressful job i felt like this helped slow my hair loss after only a few weeks the marine complex maybe nioxin vitamins which i loved also had a similar marine formula i'm trying the extra strength for thinning hair next this one was the maximum strength for normal hair i just ordered a day supply of extra strength i started taking viviscal on sept st in am in pm after a little more than wks i definitely noticed a difference in strength and fullness however a few weeks later my hair became brittle and started breaking on jan st i cut the dose to one a day i hope this will solve the brittleness while this was my body's reaction it may not be yours would recommend you give it a try good i m not sure if i took them long enough to notice a huge difference but i like to think i did notice a difference with growth thickness they work i've been trying to grow my hair out forever ever since i started drinking in my early 's my hair has gotten brittle and thinned on the top use this as preventative i tried sugar bear didn't work biotin didn't work nature valley hair skin and nails nope but this i swear by this product in a little less than four weeks my hair has grown thicker and longer photo on the left right after hair cut and photo on the right weeks later five starts awesome amazing my hair started thinning in my early s by the time i was i wore baseball hats most days because my hair was so thin and could do nothing with it it was coming out by the handfuls and no dr could give me a reason for it my last ditch effort was to try this and as god as my witness my hair completely stopped falling out within weeks and i immediately started seeing new growth is it back to its former density no but a lot has grown back and my hair is so soft and shiny now i ve been taking it for about years now and my hair grows like a weed i highly recommend and yes this is a real review by a real user it s going my hair my dermatologist recommended this product to treat a case of telogen effluvium biotin and multivitamins hadn't worked well in a matter of a few days the hair shedding stopped the new hair growth came in thicker and stronger than ever before from high stress last year my hair started thinning at my hairline and at the crown of my head i was at a loss and then a friend recommended viviscal he started balding and it reversed the process and his hair looks great months of diligent use later i am so relieved to say that my hair grew back and it's shinier and healthier than before better than i could have hoped for thank you viviscal i should add i tried biotin and other hair supplements while i was searching for a remedy and none of them worked for me i was desperate and researching hair doctors in my area i'm so glad i shared my struggle with my friend and he recommended this product i needed to repair my hair after years of hair extensions and after months i haven't noticed a dramatic length increase but i have noticed a dramatic improvement in thickness i wasn't going to post a review but then this weekend my hairdresser knew i was taking some sort of vitamin because she saw a huge difference in my hair will continue to use this taking them daily and have noticed a lot of new hair growth my hair had been falling out on and off since i was i'm after a couple weeks of this combined with scalp dermarolling and oiling i lose only a few strands per day my eyelashes are now two layers and my eyebrows have stopped falling out other things i suggest are to take probiotics and enzymes do not go on a super low carb diet but also eat enough healthy fat and protein i believe a mix between the ketogenic diet and a plant based diet are the best ones for hair growth an d prevention of hair loss these vitamins are crucial though and i love them love i am not one to write reviews but since you can't trust all reviews online and i am a real human who was stressed over my hair loss i had after moving from sunny vitamin d filled florida to vitamin d deficient nyc i could perhaps spread some hope to those out there who may be skeptical i started taking viviscal june th i am no angel with taking both pills every day sometimes i forget quite honestly however the results are amazing i had a friend in town whose hair looked incredible and she happened to be taking viviscal for years total and highly recommended it so i read review after review and thought i would give it a try now i have new hair growth along my edges where i never had hair grow before i also have inches of new hair growth that sprouts from the top of my head and makes me look like i got electrocuted if i don't hairspray it down i read a blind study where they say the results are most noticeable at months year but i will say that i noticed a sure difference within months i am really excited to see what my hair is going to look like in one year next dec amazing wish i could afford to continue with them i have extremely fine hair and have always been self conscious i even use babe tape in extensions which are excellent and i highly recommend but very costly i've been taking viviscal in hopes of ultimately no longer needing the extensions and it has worked wonders tastes a little funky but otherwise is making me so much more confident with my hair my hair feels monumentally thicker and doesn't shed as much when i brush blowdry highly recommend viviscal to anyone with thin fine hair to god be the glory viviscal has always been a wonderful product for me i started using it back in i stopped using it for a while and never should have did that i have been back on it for months now with much prayer because it was so damaged the texture of my hair is just beautiful it looks beautiful it feels good and i thank god for that i'm giving god all that credit for working through viviscal blessings apostle vera i have been using viviscal for a little over a month now and it is a nice natural product it is basically a vitamin for your hair i use it together with minoxigaine minoxigaine by hairgenics fda approved hair growth formula with minoxidil plus powerful dht blockers which is a combination of rogaine's minoxidil with other hair growth ingredients that really work i definitely notice less shedding and some new hair growth really works i am currently growing out a pixie cut and this helps a lot i have thin hair and while i'm looking to grow my length back in shorter time i was also hoping this would help with thickness i do see some baby hairs around my hairline i've been using it about weeks and i see a difference the only problem is that it gave me breakouts likely due to the biotin not sure if i'll repurchase for this reason i may just take iron with vitamin c and increase my protein intake also the iron seems to give me constipation i'm trying once a day instead of two to see if that helps they do work taken every day my hair grew noticeably after a few months it took a while to kick in but i def saw a huge difference i was impressed and understood the price better once i noticed the difference really works hair grew a lot fast very good this vitamin is really working on my hair that the beauty salon fried this is my nd month taking them great product product seems to be working still in the process i have been taking this almost a month and i have noticed very little hair in my shower and in my comb not to mention those little hairs that always seem to break are starting to grow the only complaint i have is that i am going to have to get many more haircuts because my hair is growing fast started to see hair growth near the end of the first month i'm on my second month and have hairs coming in that are almost an inch long great product ok i'm a returning customer my hair is proof it works and dries out without it excellent results within one to two weeks had previously used viviscal with some success but over time forgot to include it in my daily vitamin routine been back at it for months now and i do see growth albeit fine wisps people if you just got the product and haven't used it for to days you shouldn't do a review people need to be realistic unless you have hair the just grow super fast it doesn't work that way i've been using it now for months and i'm just now seeing real results are the edges when i can say oh ok i will write more in a few months to see if this if just peach fuzz or is it really growing in strong i believe this works and have been ordering for months but the last package i received had poor foil in the packaging trying to push out a pill caused the foil in the whole area to open and i had pills falling out in the drawer with this problem i cannot thing the product was fresh and i certainly did not like hunting for pills spilled in my makeup drawer i am hoping this manufacturer will offer me a replacement package of at no cost as i need to order again and if they cannot send a replacement i will have to go elsewhere ontime shipping excellent love has helped with nails and hair i still have hair loss but not as much the smell is gross so just chuck them down for the past seven years or so my hair has fallen out a lot some days i could see it just falling as i sit my clothes covered in my hair i have tried a lot of things recently i purchased two products at about the same time viviscal and evening primrose oil and have been taking them together my hair does not fall out any more i saw results right away i don't know if it is one product or the other or even both i'm scared to stop one and jinx it needless to say i am very happy good product have seen thicker hair after months of use best results i have ever gotten and i have tried for years my hair is longer and thicker holy moly it works about a month and a half in i decided to take a little after photo to see if there was any noticeable change i can t believe this pretty much planning on taking this forever viviscal works it takes time and you have to take two every day i noticed real results after about months it's been about months now and i have many women my age asking what i do to have such a full head of hair i also tried to enhance my diet with more vegies and i stopped sugar for months you are what you eat although i am not totally into all organic because of the cost i try to take care to eat as well as possible try it and it might surprise you i am no longer trying to hide my scalp that you could see through my very thin hair i love the results and it feels great i feel pretty for the first time in years awesome product these hair nutrient tablets really work my hair used to fall out horribly now i have very little hair loss when i take a shower or brush my hair its ok but not the best for hair loss i took this faithfully twice a day for months during that time i didn't really notice a difference but i kept at it now i'm at month six and my hair feels like it's turning into a chia pet and my hairstylist has noticed you have to stick with it and understand hair growth cycles are a slow process i should mention i also take this with mc of biotin and adrenal supplements bovine ashwaganda and shisandra to support hormone balance and thyroid key players in thinning hair issues both hypo and hyperthyroid can lead to thinning issues hope this helps someone the best very pleased with purchase love these but sometimes i forget to take it later in the day i hope you can figure out how to make it a once a day vitamin very good for hair growth mom loves it when i take this as directed my hair growth rate is back to inch each month the way it was when i was a kid also saves me because i can still use my normal hair care instead of switching to more expensive 'hair growth' products if i'm feeling motivated i can boost the results with regular scalp massages and topical scalp stimulation products e g tea tree oil carol's daugher rene furterer etc literally the only product that has helped me my skin my hair i just started my rd month and i must say this vitamin is awesome my nails are rock hard it's to soon to see the full effects on my hair but i can tell that it's working excellent product and condition https www amazon com dp b jpj zs ref cm cr ryp prd ttl sol packing shipping ok worked as expected i'll give a review on this product after i order the second box first produce that worked still is working hair is finally growing at the hairline i am yr old female and it is reccissing the hair line was so far back i have tried bictoin vitamins shampoos which all did work upon taking these within a week i could see peach fuz it is growing in i can't believe it it's growing i am so happy with this product great product my hair started thinning in my mid 's due to stress at work since taking viviscal my hair is growing back thicker and healthier then before i especially like this product because it doesn't cause hair to grow faster in less desirable places armpits legs etc i have been taking these for weeks now and i would have to say it s working i haven t seen much hair growth yet since i haven t been taking them for to long but i have notice my hair stopped falling out as much and also feels thicker the product performed as expected i've been using it for about a year and i've seen good results good product been using it for a year my hair is longer and fuller but as for regrowth where the hair is thin not so sure it is successful i intend to keep using it because hair gets thinner as you age and i'm thinking ahead this are fine but the pills are hard for me to take too early to tell how they are satisfied with purchase used this product for two months and definitely saw a difference in my super fine hair you have to take them for months to see full effects be careful take it on super full stomach these pills have iron and if you take it they might make you nauseous it made me super nauseous unless i took it on a very full stomach and for the first two days i had a very very bad migraine this product works it takes about three months to realize how well but now i cannot use it anymore because of too much iron in my system i have been using now for months i can see regrowth in my hairline i saw significant hair growth within two months the product has thickened my weak hair located in the crown of my head and even grew hair in my thin spots both sides in front of my ears use it regularly so far so good i am almost done with my second box so about two months in my hair seems to be filling in on the sides and feels looks noticeably thicker a few other things i am doing to help with hair loss blow drying less frequently and with warm air rather than hot i also got a more gentle hairbrush started sleeping with my hair down rather than in a ponytail or bun trying to beak the habit of putting my sunglasses on top of my head when i m not wearing them being more mindful when throwing my purse on to avoid it pulling on my hair great so far have only been using for less than a month i was skeptical at first but after the first month of taking viviscal my hair has grown so much it's thick and lustrous my hair is so healthy since using this product my hair has started to grow back lost a bunch after surgeries back to back but now my hair is fuller healthier seems to help i am a cancer patient and this helped me keep my hair works great but made my scalp breakout skirt fits as expected i have this skirt in another color and it washes well for the price the skirt is a good buy i heard this helps grow and strengthened your hair i used it for a few weeks and didn't see much results so i stopped taking it now i just take biotin or other hair vitamins to help grow my hair it works i know i was as surprised as you are been using this for almost a year and my hair looks great didn't notice immediate results but over time yr my hairdresser has noticed a difference as have i i'm not sure if it is this product or the biocell i'm taking for my joints but i have noticed more peach fuzz around the outline of my scalp and my nails are stronger and growing long so something is working i did notice a change on the cover of the box that i purchased previously to this one the one from last month had a red label and this one has a burgundy label thought that was odd i love viviscal it really works love this product great price i've been taking for months really works this stuff really works not sure if it is helping after a year very good product great my dermatologist recommended this still taking it going on months no change can tell a big difference in my hair since using this product salon operator confirmed hair is getting thicker i have been using this for about months now very satisfied omg this stuffs amazing with my job i never had long finger nails now since taki g viviscal my hair is so much better and i now have to cut my fingernails because they get too long never imagined i'd ever find such a great vitamin i love it great price excellent product i have seen a huge difference in my hair since i have been taking this vitamin i also incorporate an health diet i have been taking the viviscal for months my hair was getting thin on top especially in the natural part i have in the middle i can see new growth and my part line is looking much better i'm going to continue to take viviscal and see what happens in the next months great buy been taking this for over a year now i do notice that the amount of hair loss has decreased and the condition of my hair seems to have improved it's a bit pricey for what it does but it works well enough for me to continue to pay it really works if taken twice a day very impressive results i have several friends that have been taking viviscal for a while and the hair growth they have experienced is amazing i have been taking it for several months and have seen the same results my hair does not fall as it did prior to taking these tablets you have to be compliant with the twice a day schedule once a day does not give you the same results i've only been using it for a week and maybe it's because i'm only but i swear i already see results i've struggled with unmanagable slow growing incredibly thin hair my entire life and on top of that i thought it was a fantastic idea to bleach the heck out of it in middle school i take two in the morning with breakfast every day and you can no longer easily see my pale scalp through my dark hair it is an incredible confidence boost and although expensive for pills it is already very worth the price to me i've also grown what seems like an inch how is this even possible ddd so happy can't wait to see what prolonged use brings fantastic hair vitamins visviscal got my hair in great condition i also use their shampoo and conditioner and my hair now is in superb condition the vitamins are great and i saw a change in about two weeks the price was great as wel can't tell if working i'm always skeptical of the unknown so i read about a hundred reviews decided to give it a go months in now and i'm seeing tall new hair growth the front and top of my hair feel look thicker and shinier my sides and crown are still thin however i'm only way to the recommended results timeline my hopes are high my fingers are crossed as a professional entertainer my hair is of the utmost importance towards the end of last year it was thinning at an alarming rate i tried this on a recommendation was startled to find that for me it does everything it advertises i am now finishing my rd box but in the beginning of the nd box i saw a very noticeable change when i st started the tablets i used the viviscal hair fibers to fill in very thinning 'trouble spots' now i no longer need the fibers the hair grew back long enough to cover the scalp quite well most definitely worth the purchase too soon to tell work properly i have grown bunch hair great results i love it it works very good product for the hair so far so good see a diffrence this product was very good and the service from amazon was excellent thanks recommend these hair growth pills my wife is very satisfied with the product ok they are definitely living up to my expectations good i like it i have tried many products for hair regrowth this is by far working the best i recommend it to anyone that is experiencing hair loss i did not think i could do this at my age and now i can let my gray hair grow out and enjoy it when it's finish i will know great product it works a few hours after taking the first pill i felt tingling and an itchiness in my scalp to me i knew right there that it was a sign that it was doing something but i do take it in combination with something else so it is certainly or part of the picture at this point time wise it has been only just over weeks but there is more hair i can see already this stuff works great i lost a lot of hair with a medication side effect and this has helped to replenish the volume back to what it was have to be patient slow and steady growth not necessarily faster growth been using these for a few years helps my hair grow fast excellent seller great product the tablets are easy to take and i'm hoping it helps with my hair loss i've only been taking it for a month so we'll see viviscal actually works hair grows way too fast ans is actually thicker awesome it really works love this product my hair has regrown back even bald patches i dont know which of my hair products are working to restore my hair perhaps all of them i am yrs and battling w thinning hair since menopause particularly frontally with good success i use viviscal twice daily neuhair enhancer at night biotin tab daily hair plush caffeine hair thickener also i use 'got b fat tastic' mousse as a cosmetic thickener my hair is colored cut in a below the ears modified bowl cut and is soft full and swingy goodness the struggle is daily to keep hair on my head and off my face upper lip keep up the good efforts awesome product hair hasn't been this healthy in years so far i am happy with the product and i am seeing results i was very surprised at how much i like the shampoo conditioner and elixir i am not getting the shedding i was getting before using this product i plan to continue to use it and would recommend it product works hair stopped falling out after months of using at months i had new curly hairs sprouting all over my head i think what also helps is brushing hair only once a day totally recommend it works my nails are stronger but i haven't been using the product long enough to see if my hair has improved totally helped my hair i was only taking it once a day and when i read the instructions and started taking it twice a day it worked even better my hair started shedding and thinning over a year ago my hair stylist recommended this product a year later and i have seem a remarkable change in my hair my hair is now thicker stronger and growing i strongly recommend this product it is excellent for all types of hair really helped my hair grow after losing my hair due to stress thank gd it worked it's a wonderful product for hair loss it has helped my hair fill in after chemo not bad at all infact very good this is a miracle my hairdresser commented on my beginning regrowth good not sure about hair strength but it's certainly growing at a faster rate everytime time i go to the salon my stylist can't believe how fast my hair grows i really think this product helps my hair grow better faster stronger but it is too expensive for me i had to take it for a couple of months before noticing a difference but it did happen eventually love viviscal noticed that when washed my hair the tub would have so much hair now my hair is not falling out as much looks healthy and full great product i only take once a day instead of twice as i do not bring it with me at work after half a box gone about a month hair is visibly stronger thicker and most importantly i don't shed anymore haven't used it long enough to give a revie helps a lot much less falling out and people and myself think its getting thicker this product stopped my shedding i can definitely say i am very happy with this product two months ago i decided to try it because every time i showered clumps of my hair was falling out and it was scaring me a month and a half into consistently taking this everyday barely any hair at all falls out when i shower now i am very happy i can start seeing results but you have to have patience and consistently take it i just started but it's appears to be working i have used it for some time now it has started togrow my hair out in areas that were very thin and showed my scalp i recommend it to any women with thinning hair fastest shipping ever exactly as described it takes some time of consistently taking them daily but this product truly works i have only been using this product for a month but i am seeing positive changes in my hair nails and skin using for one year now and my hair is waaaayyyy thicker i would look to your nearest walmart before buying here readily available a bit cheaper and authentic i used this for a few months i didn't see a major difference when i initially started i was not gluten free and noticed hair in places on my face where there was none before i had some regrowth of hair this past month i stopped taking it i said i don't need to bother anymore and i can save the big mistake i noticed one of my eyebrows is thinning and i have even more shedding and breakage i bought a box today my hair is worth the money coupled with gf living i should see a turn around for me wheat messes up my vitamin absorption i know it does take this right after you eat so you don't get an upset stomach we have yet to see a miracle out there but this is a hot item and i think for many it works try it i did see a woman who had been using it faithfully for a few years i guess we all need consistence and patience with our hair problems love it love it i've been using it for months i love it i am using this product because friends of mine said it also helps nails i have removed my artificial nails after years still too early to tell as far as my hair my hair has always been good so i have not seen any change in months i sure hope that this helps hair growth someone told me that is so and it is the second time ai have tried them it is hard to tell though please check with your my wife convinced me to start taking this supplement not by words but by her clearly noticeable thicker and fuller hair her fingernails are also definitely stronger as well i will stay with the one tablet a day for several months because the effect takes time to develop have been using these loyally for months and i've seen great improvements in my hair my hair is coming back i am yr old female with hashimoto's thyroid disease and your hair can fall a lot when your thyroids are wacky or even from poor nutrition these did the job even my eyebrows are thicker and lashes too great outcome but you have to be diligent and it will take at least months for you to start seeing results the first month you will notice a lot less hair fall by month and you will see hair regrowth best ever i ve been using it a week and haven t noticed any ill effects i usually do well with biotin supplements so hope that this works i have used this product for years i saw on dr oz and i really feel at times i would not have hair if not for this product the guest on dr oz was a famous hair stylist and said she started it after death of her mother and was not taking care of herself so i thought i would try and again i live life with a lot of stress and have had hair loss in past from it since staying on this product i have not i now get it monthy delivered through amazon so i do not forget to buy i highly recommend the try i believe any product like this there is a time period you do need to stay on before knowing so there is a commitment i would say for a month to two months before giving up on it i take twice a day i hope this helps because i understand the awful feeling of some hairloss due to stress love it my hair is looking healthier and longer these vitamins are the best i've tried for thinning hair my hair almost looks as good as before when i lost most of due to medical issues i've been taking for months began taking this may st it's too soon to tell if my hair is growing yet but my nails could be used as a screw driver if i couldn't find a real one plus they're growing a fast as the grass in the lawn after years of putting on nail extensions on finicky nails this is great hopefully the thinning hair will follow soon i'll update in another month i promised an update wow after the st month may i could put my hair up in a french twist or pony tail a little skimpy but by now the end of june it's decidedly better shine and thicker texture have also returned good bye rogaine hello viviscal my new best friend oh yes my nails are still growing like weeds no complaint there and to think i was once thinking of getting a wig try it you'll love it no aside effects only praise after taking for just beginning the rd month months now sept nails still growing like crazy my french twist or pony tail is looking better think this is because the texture has changed i read that you shouldn't take longer than months so i'll finish up what i have in weeks and just take biotin and prenatal vitamins which have been recommended great product and it works my hair is fuller now than it has been in years thanks been on these vivascual pills and using the viviscual shampoo and condition and also the hair density product which i take every other day i just completed my first month use i can see new baby hairs starting to fill my spots where i had the loss i will give a better review next month but i highly recommend this company i love this stuff it makes a tremendous difference in my hair i started using this product about three months ago and have already noticed some new growth i also use the shampoo and it has really made a difference in the texture and body of my hair i will continue using it which was recommended by my dermatologist these vitamins are the best supplements i've ever purchased for my hair i did my research before making the decision to try these and they did not disappoint i was looking for a supplement that had a proven clinical scientific study not a fly by night to good to be true hair vitamin my hair grows at a pretty good rate as it is so i can't say much about this supplement for growth some years back my hair has lost major density after my dr had me on alot of antibiotics for a condition that resulted in me having to have a hysterectomy nothing i did helped thicken it my hair was so thin i didn't like wearing it straight i'm african american because you could see through it now my hair is so thick that it takes upwards of an entire day to wash condition detangle and style it and my hair is short i clipper cut all my hair off my hair is now over all over which averages to over a month if you're looking for a gimmicky product to grow your hair fast this isn't it but if you're looking for something to help you grow thick healthy hair along with good eating habits you've found the holy grail give it months before making a sound decision on whether this is the product for you you need to also take into consideration that if you have genetically thin hair this product will not create thick hair this product helps wake up dead hair follicles that previously had hair growing within it i've been using this product since february and it's the best thing since sliced bread i don't notice as much thinning when taking these good product this is an amazing product that really works but it does take time i started using this product and was purchasing it from rite aid and then realized amazon had it as well so it is a subscription for me i was taking two a day for a little bit but found that one a day works well for maintenance and it has helped my hair a lot i dyed my hair and did that for a number of years and as i got older the hair just stopped growing and starting breaking way too easily and i found i could not grow my hair at all i found this product and i had tried a number of them over the years with few lasting results i was desperate for something and so stuck with this and i can say though it does take at least months or maybe more to really start seeing the results the results were like night and day for me i love my hair again i highly recommend you try this but keep in mind it does take time it is well worth the price and the effort yes it works i love this prodiuct i am no longer experiencing hair thinning have just started using this product so am not able to fairly rate it yet i've been taking viviscal for about months now and i see a major difference i've been battling colon cancer for the last several years cancer chemo age and medicines that i had been placed on made my once envied hair dull thinning and looking sad i came across an article maybe in vogue where the writer tried them with great results and thought why not can't get any worse i am soooo thankful that i did because they have made a major difference for me enough of a difference that i have had people remark about it i can also see about several inches of new growth around my hairline as well as it has helped my nails i do have to get my brows tweezed more frequently because it makes all hair grow but that is a pittance to pay in comparison to regaining your self esteem i highly recommend this product it's doing great for my girl thanks came quickly and it was exactly what i ordered how it was described using it since february and it seems to be working easy to take and i do see an improvement in my hair very good works wonderfully i could tell a difference within the first month seems to help some only time will tell i believe it working my hair is extremely damaged this is my nd box i will continue to use continue to post my results my daughter has seen amazing results not everyone is the same so i will give it more time it has proven to work i cant really say anything other than they work i have pcos and desperately needed something that wouldnt make my new growth fall out if i were to ever stop taking it these do not cause hair loss after stop taking them i think my hair is growing but i loos so much hair everyday also i've tried everything and now have been using viviscal religiously now every night before i go to bed and my hair has stopped falling so drastically i actually have little patches of new hair that i'm noticing because they are somewhat unruly but i'll take whatever i can get i only take it once a day but am thinking of increasing to twice a day like the package suggests and am thinking i'll really see some new growth i love this product great product these vitamins are the best supplements i've ever purchased for my hair i did my research before making the decision to try these and they did not disappoint i was looking for a supplement that had a proven clinical scientific study not a fly by night to good to be true hair vitamin my hair grows at a pretty good rate as it is so i can't say much about this supplement for growth some years back my hair has lost major density after my dr had me on alot of antibiotics for a

bread oh yes these absolutely work even my stylist for the st time ever said she noticed a big difference in how fast my hair was growing not to mention i have to cut my nails all the time they grow like weeds i can't make a fist i don't like them long anyway i would highly recommend this product it works great this hair supplement really does make a difference my only complaint is that they have a strong fishy smell and they're kind of big i got over it though for the benefits of taking them my wife rosie has been using this product for years now seems to work better when used with rogain as well been using this a month and already see a huge difference i'm reluctant to review products but i feel i must in this case when i was young my hair was my crowning glory at menopause i lost about half of my hair volume when i was widowed after years of happy marriage my hair fell out at an appalling rate i was starting to look like gollum i tried a laser comb which helped special shampoos no noticeable difference rogaine which turned my few remaining strands to straw and oodles of different supplements viviscal is the only one that worked i put viviscal on auto ship and take it quite religiously i have not regained my former crowning glory but i no longer suffer from a crowning humiliation i strongly urge anyone man or woman to give viviscal a try it works it works as long as you take it after three months you can take it every other day but it has to be consistent for it to work it works highly recommend the vitamins kept my hair from thinning and it grew fast luv ve this product i've used it two months and my hair has started looking thicker and i've seen new hair growth i'm a believer i've used other hair vitamins these actually worked for me i was recommended this by a friend i was skeptical but decided to give it a try i have long normal thickness hair but when i pull it back in a ponytail my hair on the sides near my bangs was wispy and also my part at the crown of my head has a calik and the hair tends to part unless i brush it over the area so long story short my hair seems thicker fuller the couple sparse areas have filled in and my hair looks and feels better i started taking this and i really noticed towards the nd and rd week i just finished my month supply and reordered it goodluck and i seem to get mor compliments on my hair best hair product ever i am months into taking it and i am seeing regrowth and my husband noticed too thank you viviscal save me money on wigs lol i am slowly starting to see new growth but it has taken about months so patience is the key still in first weeks i feel more hungry waiting for good result looks like i have some hair growths it has been months it is not as fast as i expected no good my hair had been thinning considerably over the past years to the degree that i was feeling self conscious being in my s i imagined it was because of age however my skin is in great shape for my age six weeks ago i decided to get proactive and heard about viviscal from a hairdresser bought it that day and have been taking it religiously and voila i have a significant amount of regrowth and am thrilled unlike other reviewers i have not gained weight suffered headaches or had any side effects important to note that i also did extensive research and discovered a condition called traction alopecia which i suspect was contributing to my case of thinning hair for the past several years i have been sporting a pair of metal framed wraparound sunglasses that were doubling as a hair band to keep my locks away from my face shades on top of head is my signature look even on rainy days or while inside the house at my desk etc about the same time as starting on viviscal i stopped pushing my shades up and down on my head which alleviated all that tightness and pressure rubbing and snatching strands of hair from the top of my head in short i think that the combination of viviscal and removing the traction of the sunglasses are to be credited with my success story this is my six month and i can definitely see a difference my hair has filled in by my forehead and all in all it feels thicker with less hair falling out i have purchased this from many different sources and it all seems about the same to me i guess i'll keep taking it i've been using this product for about years now and i see an improvement in my hair and in my nails best pills my hair is so much better i use this daily and have for a long time i really do think it helps with making hair thicker and stronger works wonders on my c hair great product my hair is growing very healthily been using for three months i see a difference in my nails not sure about the benefits to my hair but my hair has always been painfully slow growing hair is in better condition am on second box hope it gets thicker viviscal is the best vitamin ever amazon prime had it less expensive than the drug stores that is what caught my eye this stuff is the greatest for people like me due to prolonged periods of stress my hair began coming out by the handfuls i was devastated until i saw the box in the drugstore along with all the matching hair products within months my hair started to grow back it was amazing and now i can't be without it thanks for such a great product i've honestly had a wonderful experience with viviscal stress and my thyroid has truly affected my hair it is extremely thin and had patches of where there was none i have even gone to bosley restore but don't have the money for those type of procedures not only have i subscribed to viviscal to get my tablets monthly but i also take it in the morning with fish oil tablet and biotin i love and have even bought some for my cousin who is thinning love it been using this product for months i totally see the difference in the spaces in my scalp a little pricey but worth it and you have to keep up with it twice a day any product that will keep you and your hair healthy is worth more than words can say i have noticed a huge difference in hair health after purchasing three boxes now am on the next three i am finally seeing results well not really but when my kids come to visit they always tell me how full my hair is now i guess when you see your self every day you don't notice it i've used this for over a year and my hair dresser has noticed that i have less bare spots will continue to use it works great it works for me great vitamin for your hair this i've used this for years it works my hair was shedding and eyebrows were thinning i saw results after the first month my hair grew back healthier thicker and longer than ever people noticed and constantly mention how healthy my hair appears ive been using this a few years now i will say that it makes hair grow fast everywhere i do mean everywhereeee lol it also makes me cut my nails more often as well does it make hair grow back i am not sure i see little hairs on my head poking through but i am not sure if that is breakage or new growth i have had less hair fall out from taking this everyday so that has been a plus i'm surprised how much thicker my hair is after using this product i began seeing results in weeks hair don't fall out that much anymore but only used it for a month so far only been using it about weeks so far no complaints very easy to swallow taste is ok also i belive ths is working for me i have new hair growth thru out since using it starting in jan i couldn't stick with the a day using it a day i have about little more then of new hair figuring hair growth at a month it adds up i will keep using it day fyi might be a little binding on the bowels good product noticed growth and or slowed hair loss i've been taking viviscal for about to months and my hair is growing my new baby hairs are soft and curly i am very pleased with this product i've been using this for about years really grew my edges back in and all over my head i started to see it in about months after using repeat user like great hair product awaiting more results only nd month on tablets been thru alot of surgeries last year and need to build up my hair vitamins these are great plus my hairdresser told me about them love this product very good i'm near and i had become very thin hair within these years just taking two weeks it helps me stop hair loss by as usually around more than hair fell daily it's really works i'll like to share the result after months supply the tablet taste very fishy but i suggest to chew a bit before swallow with water if you have a sensitive stomach absolutely amazing my hair was getting thin and lank and i figured it was just old age over but i decided to try viviscal i knew it would take a while so i just incorporated two pills into my daily habits and forgot about it it was perhaps or months later that i realized how much thicker my hair was how much bounce and shine it had was this stuff really working i had no other explanation for it it is pricey but of course i couldn't stop i now take one viviscal a day in the morning and a biotin supplement at night biotin is much cheaper and is the major ingredient in viviscal i have been on this regime for four or five years and my hair has remained lush and full i will never stop something i buy all the time it works shipped and delivered as stated no complaints i've been taking for a year less fall out thicker hair i didn't take this as soon as i got it to be honest i hate being responsible for remembering to take pills considering how great the results have been i will definitely make this apart of my daily routine great products my hair grew so good when i was taking this nails and skin too will purchase again viviscal is great this is my rd month using it and i can see a big difference in growth around my temples i will definitely keep using it i originally thought this product was gimmicky but decided to give it a try it actually worked i only took it once per day instead of the recommended twice per day and i still saw really good results i have always had hair that grows painfully slow but i could actually see the growth with this product works had hair loss from a flared up condition still have small patches of hair loss from it but hair is growing back great product happy with results it works i started using this about weeks ago and i do think my hair is falling out way less than before on the looks of it it seems to be working this has worked wonders on my hair i have a very bad case of over styling and subsequently lost i am a year old woman who has taken these for months and in months i actually have new hair on both the sides that filled in my bald spots i have tried mostly everything to no avail but thank god i never gave up a day after a meal and there are no side effects whatsoever two a day makes your bald go away this is a commitment for months i've just started my third month and am delighted i suffered from medicinally induced hair loss and shed about of my hair in this third month of taking viviscal twice daily my hairdresser who i've had for years commented on how much more my hair has grown in between appointments and how much thicker it is at the roots hooray another bonus is that my eyelashes are insanely long and my nails are growing faster too i have not experienced any side effects at all i plan to continue taking viviscal and am excited to see the future results excelent i've noticed after months my hair is thicker and growing faster i have to return to the salon for color and root touch ups every to weeks instead of my nails and skin look amazing as well also be sure to drink plenty of water excellent product begin seeing results in nail growth in about a week my hair is longer now than it has been since i was years old lots of compliments thank you viviscal love it i was going bald from my birth control and stress this has brought my hair back i strongly recomend this please understand i already have a hormone embalance so this really brought back my hair i originally bought this to make my medium length hair return to its former glory although my hair is longer the true testament is my eyebrows are growing back i have naturally sparse eyebrows and i overplucked from age i'm now and gave up hope that they would ever grow back cue this product and my eyebrows are fuller than they have been in years i wasn't truly a skeptic as i have tried everything but after just one month i am seeing a significant increase in growth along my already very high hairline i'm telling everyone so easy take two pills a day and improve hair growth significantly no brainer it works my wife's hair has noticeably come back over the last few weeks it's extraordinary you know it's one of those patented medicines that you can't really put your finger on anything but you keep your fingers crossed and hope for the best it stinks so it must be either real or good or both product works wonders great service super product it works great product but is not very effective if hair loss is due to medication this product works i have been using this product for a while now but decided i would order it from you very satisfactory this stuff works end of story i noticed some thinning hair on the top front and sides of my head right around my face after i decided to take a year off from the pill after years of constant use bad idea horrible idea but anyway one of the many nasty things that happened was my hair fell out i'm only and my curly hair has always been thick so i was a tiny bit devastated i got back on the pill not because of my hair and tried some different expensive shampoos and vitamins with maybe a little difference but nothing to brag about came across these and read some amazing reviews and crossed my fingers and ordered some i'm almost finished with my nd box of pills i have taken them religiously twice and day and i can't sing it's praises loud enough my nails are thicker and harder than they've ever been in my entire life and the little fuzzy curly baby hairs around my face are impossible to dispute i know it's going to take a while and i will probably never get back to how my hair used to be but this product has been a real self esteem booster and i will continue to take it as long as it's available hopefully forever it a good product at the age of i was noticing thinning hair in some areas my older sister whom has hair like a yr old has been taking viviscal for years i started wks ago and my hair is much thicker my hair is at the middle of my back healthy and beautiful my hair never grew past my shoulders love this product i have been using this for at least years i have thin hair i am not sure if this product is maintaining my hair and keeping it from thinning but i would not want to take a chance and stop using it i also take mg of biotin daily have not been using for a long time but it seems to be working it works thicker healthier hair great product big difference in my hair brilliant in looks and feel i've used this product in the past and like i was running low so i immediately wanted to get some more it's an good vitamin for the hair my hair grows very slow and when i say slow i mean growing an inch takes months taking the vivisval for a month i've noticed my hair has grown a little more than half an inch which is miraculous to me i could be crazy but i see a big difference and i've used several popular hair growth vitamins viviscal is the best supplement you can take for healthy hair it is recommended by most professional hair dressers can see the difference though it takes four to six months i've noticed some thickening with my hair since i started using this product i don't really have much growth yet but my hair is thicker grt price my rd box now and i can really tell a difference in thickness and growth rate note i only take tablet daily a little too pricey for me to take daily but the one a day i do take really helps after using for weeks i can certainly tell that it is working love it i have very fine hair that breaks easily i have been taking viviscal for four years and although i would love to have thicker longer hair viviscal still keeps me fro thinning and breakage i will continue to take viviscal for years to come this is a great product for your hair i had surgeries back to back and it really took a toll on my hair a lot of hair loss i have been taking the viviscal for months and it has really made a big difference in my hair growing back in fuller now i went through a very stressful period of months and noticed more than usual hair loss after shampooing and brushing my hair my hairdresser and a relative recommended this product i have taken it for three months and it works i have noted a considerable decrease in hair loss and tons of hair growing back in excellent choice for strengthening hair and regrowth it made my hair grow a lot faster great product its working time will tell if it works i've only been taking a few weeks great product for my thinning hair i'm amazed at the health and thickness of my hair after using for a couple of months i' e been using this product for over three months now and i can swear by it good too soon to tell i only purchased it a month ago and it says to give months for noticeable results this product works i never run out if i run out my hair looks terrible i will use this product for a long time i get so many kind compliments on my hair i ordered this for the first time n oct my blonde hair was thinning a lot falling out i thought i would give it a try so glad i did i have new growth my hair feels fuller i am able to style it now much easier i am only loosing a little bit of hair after showering now which i feel is normal just ordered another box was developing the post menopausal thinning of my hair which has always been thick now even my hairstylist has noticed new hair growth no one is a bigger skeptic than me when it comes to hair growth treatments i've tried expensive shampoos and different scalp sprays nothing made a huge difference it's a scary fact that one out of every two women will experience hair loss thinning and of course i am one of them what lit a fire under me was when i made a video of me opening my christmas gifts from a friend who lives in another country it's how we do christmas being so far apart i saw the video of myself and i already knew i had thinning hair but it really showed up in that video my scalp was shining through my dark hair i went online and started searching out all the different treatments that weren't shampoos or sprays i read reviews from many different websites before deciding to try viviscal the reviews were pretty much positive and now here is my review i had really given up on anything really helping i'd already bought a topper and hair extensions that didn't match my natural color and are still in the box because i was putting off bleaching then dying them and even some wigs i hated the wigs they were hot and itchy and they didn't look natural so down to my last hope i got a box of viviscal locally the price was better at the time i kid you not i'm only weeks in and i can see a huge difference my scalp is still visible but nothing like it was i will be adding pics later on of my hair now and pics of my hair in a month or two i had my doubts about this working nothing else had really made a huge difference i am so glad i took a chance on this this is life changing and i'm only two weeks in i had my husband look at my hair to get his opinion and he was blown away by how much less scalp was showing i went out today and for the first time in years i wasn't embarrassed to be seen it's very traumatic to lose your hair i have nothing to gain but i'm telling you if you've tried everything and even if you haven't please give this a try i had pretty much given up now i know there is hope and in only two weeks i expected it to take months to see a difference if i was going to see a difference at all in short i am blown away by the results i've spent the last years trying to make peace with my thinning hair and that just never happened then i tried covering it up with colored dry shampoos that get all over your pillow case i tried a lot of things and not one of them did what viviscal has done for me so far i've not seen any changes in my nails but i've read where some people have said their nails got better mine haven't but i am ok with that i'll be signing up on here to get a box sent every month btw my box says made in the us it's not the made in ireland that so many people say is better i can't imagine what 'better' would be i'm getting my hair back and i never thought that would happen if you're on the fence just give it a try if i'd tried this first i'd have saved myself hundreds of dollars on products that barely worked if at all eta something i left out something that is worth mentioning i can't see the hair on the top of my head well so i had my husband look at it for me and tell me what he saw my thinning starts at my hairline and goes to the crown of my head so it's about a square on the top of my head that is thinning the worst my husband described the new growth to me he said it's thicker than the hair that's already there ie the hair i have that hasn't fallen out my hair fall has been dramatically reduced as far as how much longer my hair has gotten i can't really say for sure i honestly wasn't worried about length i was more concerned with thickness my hair is about above my waistline i have a lot of stands of hair that are about long i'm guessing that has to be the new growth as my hair is all one length no layers my hair normally grows fast anyway and i do think i've had a growth spurt since i started using viviscal i normally do a big chop every summer of anywhere from to a foot it irritates me when i'm tucking my shirts in and i have to pull my hair out of the back of my jeans i think i am going to skip the chop this year and just keep my ends trimmed just to see how far this will go since i've started using viviscal my hair loss is hormonal i'm and also stress has been pretty rough for me for many years i have very little grey my husband said the new hair coming in is darker i never color my hair my natural color is between dark brown and black i have to admit that i don't take this as it's prescribed i take together when i get up in the morning the only thing that i consider to be a side effect is that i have been dealing with breakouts that i normally don't have but they're not bad i had a breakout a few days ago and i'm already clearing up eta i've added a before and an after picture taken a month apart there is actually more scalp showing in the before picture on the crown of my head my hair is just laid back over it i wasn't able to get the same lighting for both pictures i have a ton of new growth in the second picture and my hair is so much thicker than it was a month before so obviously i'm getting new growth all over not just on the top though the top is the worst i had some errands to do today and for the first time in about years someone complimented my hair i'm really excited to get to the six month mark i think i will have much thicker hair and much less scalp showing i don't know if my results are typical because this is just one month of taking viviscal i don't mean to sound like a spokesperson because i'm not i'd just thought these kinds of results weren't possible i may be back in months with another picture thanks good product take as directed and you will see results good i noticed right after i take a pill it makes me cramp but only for little while then i'm fine have really noticed any results yet only been taking it for weeks i've been using for about days and i've already seen a difference in my hair it seems thicker to me these vitamins have made my hair nails grow stronger faster arrived on time good packaging i've been putting off writing a review for this product simply because i wanted to wait until i saw noticeable change in the health of my hair well you guys it works you have to keep up on it and you need to give it time i also used supplemental shampoo products as well because my hair is super thin and needs all the help it can get i will say that my hair isn't thicker meaning i don't have more individual hairs but my hair is strong now far less breakage and much faster growth it's so shiny and long i cannot believe i'm due for a hair cut right now i've been on it for a year and have just reduced the dosage to one vitamin a day no changes in my hair since doing so will post pictures to update this stuff is absolutely amazing my hair is twice as think after only a couple months of using and its super shiny this product is a my hair has never grown so fast in my life i take two pills a day and noticed a different in the quality softness and thickness in just one week i like this hair growth supplement because it doesn't break me out this product works even made hair that i lasered come back my hair is thicker with this product and i have used it for years every time i go off it i regret it my hair becomes thinner again best on the market for hair growth works i love it and i see the results thank u so much i started taking the pills in january they really work my hair is longer in two weeks than before the texture of my hair is different i can't explain what it is i have been telling everyone who asks about the viviscal pills i read a review from someone who purchased them from target they were not happy with the purchase and returned them they said the pills looked different but i have been telling my friends to purchase from amazon these work the bags are a good size long enough to be able to tie in a knot fresh smelling nice thickness i have been using for months and it has truly made my hair grow and has kept it from falling out love this product very happy my hair feels stronger and growing already my second order love these pills specially for me i have a hypothyroid my hair thins this really helped i'll be ordering this again thank you this is working have been using for plus months and noticing a difference greet hair vitamins hair seems stronger and fuller with regular use my daughter has taken these for some time now and notices a difference in her hair if stops for any length of time love it i tried this and didn't see much change so i will not reorder im just not a hairy person and i have taken a lot of hair pills to help i would recommend although i haven't experienced any new hair growth the loss of my hair has definitely slowed way down after only months on the tablet works great works well but once you start you have to continue taking it all the time purported to regrow hair been months and my wife says it's working so it may work for you too good luck love these hair vitamins i do see a difference they are cheaper here than at cvs or walgreens it works thought it was going to be another waste it wasn't after having two surgeries months apart my hair started falling out from the general anesthesia at i had lost of my hair in about months i've just completed month of viviscal and my hair has stopped falling out as much and i have a lot of new growth see picture i am so happy with my results and have now signed up for the subscription with target so i can use my red card can't believe target actually beat amazon on pricing the only problem i have with this is an ethical one these contain shark i'm a vegetarian and i don't feel good about taking these given there is cruelty involved i wish the amino mar ingredient was synthetic and not just ground up shark these also have a very fishy fish food like flavor and smell which is unpleasant but not intolerable minus one star for everything described in this paragraph these don't seem to bother my stomach however i do always take with food for the first month i was taking both pills in the morning on the second package i reread the instructions and have now switched to taking them as recommended one in the morning and one at night still had results taking both pills at once but i generally prefer to follow instructions for use provided by the manufacturer i've been using viviscal extra strength x a day since june a little over six months today and felt it was time to post a review and share my results with the product i use it because i have hypothyroidism which caused me to lose a lot of hair my hair loss has been going on for awhile but started getting worse in the past two years my endocrinologist had been monitoring my hormone levels tsh t t etc and tweaking my medication to keep my levels optimum but the hair loss continued no matter what we did finally my doctor suggested my hair loss may just be a natural result of aging and not thyroid related at all well i wasn't about to just sit back and go bald without fighting i'm only and when i say go bald i'm not exaggerating i had a receding hairline like a man and the top of my head was so thin that i was getting scalp sunburns i live in florida so this was a definite issue late one night i saw an infomercial for viviscal i don't generally pay attention to products sold that way i figure if they're really that good why don't they just sell them in stores but decided to give viviscal a shot i ordered it from amazon because it was much cheaper as i said i began taking it on june th for probably about months i didn't really notice a difference growth wise but did notice less hair falling out when i shampooed after the rd month my hairdresser mentioned that i had a lot of new growth on top and in the front over my forehead very short hairs that i had seen but i thought they were breakage from styling i was constantly playing with my hair trying to come up with a style that would disguise the hair loss now i'm at months out and i have to say viviscal is definitely working for me the hair loss on top in front not even noticeable at all anymore i'm absolutely amazed at how much it's grown in it's probably about inches long now and for the first time in years i'm able to pull my hair back into a ponytail some observations my hair has always been wavy but now it's very curly i have no idea if how viviscal did this but i don't care i love it secondly the texture of my hair has changed somewhat it was coarse dry but now it feels pretty normal other than the curliness and thirdly i am still experiencing hair loss when i shampoo my hair but it's honestly nothing like it used to be i used to remove a huge hairball from the tub after every shower now i'd say i remove that much in a week all in all i am thrilled with viviscal and will continue using it despite the cost although at some point i may just start taking it once a day as maintenance i highly recommend the product and would be happy to answer any questions about my use of it i was getting discouraged when i did not see improvement in a couple of months but i kept on taking them but it is now at the end of my forth month and finally am seeing results i have new hair growing where my hairline was receding and my hair is definitely getting thicker the trick is giving it enough time and not giving up i think it is also making my nails grow which is a bonus i am a year old female wish they would make the price a little easier to afford but since they do work it is worth it wow i was skeptical getting this for my mother to help regrow some hair loss from aging it works amazing i reordered more bottles for her i'm usually a non believer in miracle cures but this one worked love this this actually works i've noticed a lot less shedding and my hair is growing finally i have very fine and thinning hair these supplements don't thicken my hair but they do make my existing hair grow faster in length i wish it helped with volume i have noticed a few sprigs of new hair but not enough to make a difference i really noticed the difference in my hair and i will recommend it to my friends it arrived on time and the product was packaged perfect it seems this is working for me and i have some new hair growth around the crown of my head excellent results for hair growth j i have automatic reorder for the last two years need i say motre this stuff works it's working i have been using it now for a month and a half i noticed thickness not much length but i was looking for thicker hair and it delivered will continue to use still remaining hopeful that hair will thicken it did stop hair from falling out do not notice it getting thicker than it had been but that is fine it did great on hair loss this vitamin product works great and i would purchase this item again i never write reviews but just had to for this over the course of years my hair has fallen out three times due to stress called telogen effluvium i finally got my hair back from the last one three years ago and was enjoying beautiful hair until i noticed it was falling out again i was devasted almost suicidal this shouldn't happen three times to young year old person i could deal with it the first two times but not for a third time i don't have bald spots just overall loss of density i knew what triggered it every time and each time was emotional stress due to a break up stupid but it affected me anyways i raced to a dermatologist and she suggested viviscal i have only been using it for weeks now and i see a difference my hair just feels thicker it's shinier and i swear filling in near my part and sides the shedding has dramatically decreased too i went from being sooooo depressed about this to feeling ok again i don't look sick as anyone who experiences hair loss knows your hair looks scraggly and frizzy while it's shedding my hair just looks good i have no side effects such as nausea or acne i am praying this continues viviscal saved my sanity truly my only question and concern is does hair fall out again when you stop update i will come on here to update every few weeks if i can i have now been taking viviscal for weeks i think i spoke too soon for some reason the strengthening and thickening effects dont seem to be lasting i only finished the first pack in the box and started the second when i started the second i noticed my hair felt weak again so i opened the third pack in the same box and started that one its still the same it seems as if the dosage is different the first pack worked amazing i ordered directly from viviscal not from amazon so i know i have the real deal the shedding is still less and i do notice a little of improvement i'll continue taking it with the hopes i will see amazing results it has only been a month thickens and grow hair but not for serious problems love it i've been using viviscal for a few months i have very fine thin hair and brittle nails that peel and break when i take this consistently my nails do seem to grow stronger longer but not dramatically so my hair does seem to be growing faster and maybe a bit more full at my hairline temple area again the effects are not dramatic but they are enough that i will continue to use this product to see the effects over a longer period of time i can certainly tell when i haven't taken the tablets regularly as my nails appear to weaken the tablets have a fishy aroma but have not caused any side effects i e fishy belching i think this is the best hair vitamin i have ever taken i made a commitment to give this months but i am currently finishing up with my month i hair looks thicker and has grown faster have not been taking long enough to see difference very good product hope it works it came well recommended by friends it's the first thing that has worked great product i love viviscal it does what it says my mother takes it x a day as directed it works her hair is thicket fuller and she is so happy love these tablets must continue use to keep results i believe this works i stayed consistent and my hair is starting to grow not as thick as i use to have my hair but length definitely has improved i never thought i would get my hair back i had lost my hair to bad extensions which left me almost bald on the back of my scalp then stupid me i did a glued on piece for almost four years i lived in florida and it was just too hot to wear i then went to wigs thinking i am never getting my hair back i still wear a wig but also began taking viviscal it a slow process but my hair is coming back i believe that i will have the confidence to go without my wig in another six months so i urge people to try this product and be patient thank you and i will keep taking your supplements sincerely deb m waiting for results the very best supplement for hair on the market these are fantastic great product does what it claims to do my hair is fuller and softer and my fingernails are better also months in and my hair looks great it's thicker and it's grown almost inches just bought my fourth month highly recommend excellent i am one of the millions of women who suffer from hair loss which can be devastating i have and am using laser comb which helped but the hair loss did not stop viviscal really worked in that i am not seeing huge amounts of hair loss when i comb or in shower it did not change the texture or thickness but it definitely reduced hair loss i will take that will continue using it even though it is a little costly i just finished my first box and now on to second i love this product my picture is one month difference to the point this supplement in combination with brahmi amal hair oil has greatly increased my rate of hair growth i have very slow growing hair about to monthly though i have a good diet and am kind to my hair so since july i have used this supplement and the oil both together and separately to see if a they were effective and b which was best for me anyway each alone slightly contributed to growth but together after these months of careful measuring and adherence l and experimentation my hair has quadrupled in rate of growth and i average about per month alone this product again in my experience resulted in only slightly increased growth i have had no issues with product it has always come in a real box in properly sealed blister packages the pills have a fishy smell as one would expect but i have had no issues with indigestion or other bodily side effects of any kind i read extensively through reviews until i found an official response from the company that this product does not contain shark fin i wouldn't have used it otherwise all told i am very pleased with my results and have continued to use this supplement and the oil reviewed on its page really works okay so i recieved my two boxes of viviscal on october th and begin taking as directed the following day i had previously heard good things about the product and after taking biotin for over a year with little to no results concerning my thinning hair i decided to switch to viviscal within the first two weeks i started breaking out pretty badly but by the fourth week my ache had cleared up completely the first month was slow i didnt see any promising results pertaining to my hair my nails also werent growing which was the one thing biotin did do but after about a month and a half my hair started growing substantially i literally have not seen my hair look this full and healthy in about a decade the sides of my hair which were thinning more profusely than the rest have also filled in quite nicely as far as length it does seem to have grew a bit longer then it normally would have in that time frame but more impresseively i feel a lot more hair on my head thanks i have used it for about days and i did not notice any growth or more thickness that is true for my hair but i must say after i stopped taking it about weeks ago i can notice a huge difference on the skin on my face it is dryer not as much glow and more wrinkles are seen i am buying again for that purpose this is a great product you have to stick with it for a few months but it does create new growth i have been using this now for about months and i have new hair growth a greatr hair product great help is strengthening hair after major shedding event i am an african american female years old my hair is thinning through out my hair and especially at the temples after a month hair loss stopped at the temples after months the hair at the temples starting filling in i choose to use the male version because it does not have iron my hair is thicker and so much healthier its only been a week that i am using viviscal and my hair is already getting better however i get severe headaches works for me just as described and fast shipping thank you so much i will be ordering more got this for a friend and she loves it just the right

political views i do and the rest of my family but she's only my brother could replace tom sawyer in the books and if i didn't know better i would think the character was written after him he apitafies the term breezy so now i have a button to press when they annoy me during family get together namely the holidays so why four stars it isn't loud enough i'd say it's barely decibels and that is your ear very close to it decibels is regular speech volume but my family is not regular more like decibels and more than that if they try to out talk each other which is a frequent occurrence especially during the holidays so unless we have a moment of silence it is hard to hear this thing it would be perfect if it had another decibels i'd give it stars dropped down only because of volume

dealing with people sometimes you just need to hit something and have it tell you what you are thinking this is bull enjoy it's fun but the button sometimes doesn't work this was the hit of our white elephant gift exchange i highly recommend for anyone who has a sense of humor since it went to someone else i have no idea how long it lasted but the price was well worth the laughs we got out of it for the few hours of party i ordered this as part of a chemo care package a family member was recently diagnosed with cancer and as part of a care package i sent him i wanted to include a gag gift i told him he received all rights to hit this bulls button as many times as he saw fit he was amused my mom loves this gift i got this for my dad for christmas and he thought it was hilarious the sayings are great but the volume level is way too low you can only hear it if you're in a quiet room and you're within a couple feet of the button still a great gift for the price ok it is just a funny thing christmas gift for husband what fun in my house i am surprised it did not need batteries by the end of the week love it at work however the defcon statement is wrong the button says bulls level defcon defcon is the lowest level of readiness while defcon is imminent nuclear war or the highest level of readiness i bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it he plays with it on a daily basis great product my brother laughed at this forever says he is taking it to work to call people out on their bs a very useful button use it every day at work funny gift great gag gift this button

white elephant gift gave as a gift and the person loved it love love love love this product hilarious white elephant gift i gave this as a gift to someone who often says this is bull it was a perfect gag gift it says a few different phrases when you hit it the sound could be a bit clearer but overall a fun gift i bought this button for a yankee swap and it got swapped almost every time it has a few different ways of saying bullsh t it came with batteries already in it it was a huge hit for the gift swap it wouldn't be advised to give to kids obviously but an adult swap that is funny but not wildly inappropriate fun for hours service and product good a many different answers to friends stupid questions lol it is worth the money trust me great xmas gift love it funny gag gift i thought it may have just said that was bulls instead of that was easy but the other sayings that are programmed are funny too great product to use as a gag gift i gave this to my boss and it's definitely helped lighten up a meeting room got this because my sister in law's kids are always doing something this show's them parents know when they are lying just a fun present fun gag gift this works like you'd expect when the button is pressed a light begins to flash and a voice says when of the various phrases included all involving the word bulls it is relatively loud and obnoxious and you will probably get tired of it but it is a decent novelty for occasional use funny works great too sent this to my father in law for his birthday he works in corporate so i figured it would make a nice addition to
